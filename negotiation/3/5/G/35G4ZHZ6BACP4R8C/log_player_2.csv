"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,500.** This is less than your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Buying from John would cost $12,000.** This is more than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer and save $500."
