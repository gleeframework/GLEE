"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,450,000. This is a significant amount for Bob to consider, but it also gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects my offer. I want to maximize my profit but also keep in mind that John is a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,300,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,400,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to him. I'm aiming to split the difference between my initial offer and his counteroffer, hopefully finding a compromise that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round.  I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time, so I have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

I'm offering $1,375,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and the negotiations seem to be stalling.  I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and ending up with John's lower offer."
