{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering the product at $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This creates room for negotiation. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer.  I'm also aiming to start the negotiation at a point that will be attractive to him while still being profitable for me.
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I won't be pressured to accept an offer too low.

Let me know what happens next!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000, which shows he's not willing to negotiate in good faith.  

I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still allows you a good deal, and it's closer to a fair value for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's low offer of $9,000.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm aiming to meet halfway to signal my willingness to negotiate, but I'm still keeping the price above Bob's initial offer. This helps maintain leverage.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing that $11,000 is still a ""good deal"" for Bob. 
* **Next Steps:** I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary. I can still sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss. 

I'm choosing to reject his offer and counter again.  I'll try to get him closer to my price point, but I'm also keeping the option of selling to John for $15,000 open."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $11,500.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $11,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500.

* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product, trying to get Bob to see the benefit of paying a slightly higher price.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm phrasing the message in a way that suggests I'm open to finalizing the deal.

```

**Explanation:**
