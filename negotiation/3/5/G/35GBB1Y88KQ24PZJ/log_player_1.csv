Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower allows room to potentially secure a deal with Bob and still earn a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong offer that's still considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves him with a potential $50,000 gain if he leverages the product effectively.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other buyers and framing this as a one-time offer, I aim to encourage Bob to act quickly and consider the deal seriously."
