Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, $900000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
