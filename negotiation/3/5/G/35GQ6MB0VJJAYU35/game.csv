"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, $900000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1000000. I'm willing to go up to $975000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
