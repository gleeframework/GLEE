Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Appeal to Bob:**  My message highlights the ""great deal"" for Bob,  which might encourage him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer, without risking going too low too early.
* **Safety Net:**  I'm always aware that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for Better Deal:** I'm aiming for a higher price, and rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try to get closer to my target.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  The back-and-forth of negotiation can potentially lead to a more favorable outcome for me. 
* **Safety Net:**  I can still sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation fails."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial proposal.
* **Maintaining Value:**  This price is still above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 and closer to my minimum target of $1,500,000.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open and amicable.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that the price is ""fair"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm signaling my willingness to keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** While Bob's counteroffer is higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Selling Too Low:**  Accepting this offer would mean settling for a price that doesn't meet my financial goals.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I'm willing to continue the negotiation to try to reach a price that is more favorable for me.
* **Safety Net:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation falls apart."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** I'm  rejecting Bob's offer but showing my willingness to keep negotiating towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer represents a compromise, coming closer to Bob's offer while staying within my acceptable range.
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing that $1,000,000 is a ""fair price"" for both parties.
* **Focus on Solution:** I'm emphasizing finding a ""solution that works for both of us,"" keeping the negotiation positive and collaborative.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1000000. I'm willing to go up to $975000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a high likelihood that further negotiation with Bob will not yield a price that meets my goals. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continued negotiation could take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my desired profit and avoids the risk of a lower price with Bob. 

It's important to prioritize my minimum acceptable price and the certainty of selling to John over potentially prolonging the negotiation with Bob."
