Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you've identified.  Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite there yet.  Considering the value this product brings to you and the progress we've made, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000. She's shown a willingness to negotiate, but her concessions are getting smaller. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  Buying from John guarantees you stay within your budget."
