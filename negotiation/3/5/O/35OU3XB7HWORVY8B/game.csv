"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me. This product is useful, but not worth that much to me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you've identified.  Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but I have a firm budget. I can go up to $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, recognizing your financial constraints. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in closing this deal.  Let's get this done.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite there yet.  Considering the value this product brings to you and the progress we've made, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
