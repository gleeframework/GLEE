"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a more reasonable price point.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and understand your perspective. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a fair offer considering the value it holds.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but the gap is still too wide for me.  To be clear, I'm very interested in the product, but I need to stick to my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work. While $900,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, that price is still a bit beyond what I can justify.  My best and final offer is $950,000. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
