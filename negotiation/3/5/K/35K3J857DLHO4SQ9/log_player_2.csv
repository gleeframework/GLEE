"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,050,000? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price point.  Bob is playing a long game to save as much money as possible.  He's already shown his willingness to compromise and can likely get Alice to move further down in price with another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a fair price.  While $1,095,000 is getting closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm sure we can find a final price that makes this deal truly beneficial for both of us.  How about $1,090,000?

* **Message:** The message emphasizes the desire for a mutually beneficial outcome and highlights the potential for a successful partnership. This aims to create a positive atmosphere and increase Alice's motivation to close the deal.
* **Price:** The price is chosen to be almost at Alice's offer, but with a small margin for negotiation. With only two rounds left, this counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness and willingness to close the deal."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're glad to hear that you're still interested in making this deal work. Our final offer is $1092500. We believe this price respects the value of the product and provides a fair deal for both parties.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round remaining, it's time for Bob to make a decision. While the price is still slightly higher than his ideal, it's a good deal considering the time spent negotiating.  Here's why accepting the offer makes sense:

* **Limited Time:** Bob only has one more round.  If he rejects this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and he might be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Small Difference:** The difference between this offer and Bob's desired price is relatively small.  Accepting it allows him to save a significant amount compared to buying from John.
* **Potential for Future Partnership:** While not stated explicitly, the message hints at a potential future partnership. Accepting the offer could build a good relationship for future deals.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting this final offer is the most financially beneficial option for Bob in this situation."
