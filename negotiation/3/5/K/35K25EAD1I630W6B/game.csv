"I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000, which I think is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I've already given you a pretty good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'll make one more concession, and I'll sell it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm on a tight budget and $10,500 is the absolute maximum I can spend.  If you're unable to meet that price, I understand, but I'm hopeful we can make a deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make a living, so I'll sell it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11250.0,Alice,7,
