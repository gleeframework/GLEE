"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $10000 for this product. Let me know if this is something we can agree upon.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12500? That's still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I truly appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to go beyond $10000 for this product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,4,
