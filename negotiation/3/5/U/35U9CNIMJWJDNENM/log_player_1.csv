Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is above my minimum acceptable value of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm hoping to get closer to the true value of the product to Bob, but I'm also prepared to sell to John for $150 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I believe the product has more value than that. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175, which is halfway between my initial offer of $200 and Bob's offer of $150. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still maintain some of my original asking price. I hope this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $160. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $160 is a reasonable compromise and better than selling to John for $150. It seems like Bob is willing to negotiate, and further rounds might not result in a higher price."
