"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. A counteroffer of $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This price is still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000, leaving room for potential compromise and a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a reasonable compromise.  While Bob could potentially continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to lower the price further or that the negotiation process will become too time-consuming.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price lower than John's and within his budget."
