"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying, and I believe it's a fair price given the market value.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and while it's closer to my asking price, it's still below the value I see in this product.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This price reflects the significant value this product will bring to your operations and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,375,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I need to be honest, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the purchase if we can meet at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is simply too low. This product is truly unique and will be invaluable to your business.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,325,000. This price is fair and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is unique, but I still believe $1,325,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the purchase if we can meet at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $1,500,000.",1250000.0,Bob,10,
