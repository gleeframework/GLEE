Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
