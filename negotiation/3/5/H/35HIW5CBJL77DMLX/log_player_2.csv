"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice's offer of $9,000 is less than John's price of $10,000.
* **You still get a good deal:** While Alice is getting a good deal by selling for $9,000 (as it's more than her value of $8,000), you're also getting a better price than you would from John."
