"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. If you're interested, please let me know, otherwise, I'll consider other offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000, and John is willing to sell for that price, there's no need to negotiate with Alice.  You can secure the product immediately without risking a counteroffer from Alice that might be higher."
