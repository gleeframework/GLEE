"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand it might seem a bit high, but I can't go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground Alice.  How about $80?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has reached his maximum valuation of the product at $80.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better offer. Accepting $80 is less than what John is offering ($150)."
