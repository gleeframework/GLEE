""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so Alice needs to offer a price significantly lower than $15,000 to entice him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing Alice closer to her desired outcome. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to go below her minimum price. 

This strategy balances getting the best possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
