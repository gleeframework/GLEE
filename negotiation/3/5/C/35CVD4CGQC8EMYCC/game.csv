"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $120? It's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit low for me, but I'm trying to be fair. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,5,
