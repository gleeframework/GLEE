Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still holding out for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value and the negotiation seems to be getting more difficult.  John's offer is a guaranteed deal at my minimum price, so it's the most financially advantageous option at this point."
