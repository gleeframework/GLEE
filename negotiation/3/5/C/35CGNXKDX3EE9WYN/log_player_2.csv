"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth fairly.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation and potentially a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to try and bring the price down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to recoup a bit more for my investment.  $950,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still offers you a substantial gain, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer, it's still above the product's value to her.  There is still potential for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for another round of negotiation to see if we can close the gap further."
