Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than that.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $8,250 is the minimum I can do. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,250. Accepting this offer secures a good price for you and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and having to pay John's higher price."
