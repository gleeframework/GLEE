"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $150. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but I'm only willing to pay $130 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a price that is closer to his maximum value while still leaving room for negotiation. Offering $130 allows for a potential compromise without going too low and risking Alice rejecting the offer outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still above Bob's ideal value. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price within his budget and avoids potentially prolonging the negotiation further."
