"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $150. What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $175, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay $160.  It's the best I can do.",160.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $165, but that's as low as I can go.",165.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hoping for a bit lower price. How about $162? I'm really hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",162.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the point where I'll have to consider other buyers. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $165 is too low, so I'll meet you halfway from $162, which is $163. That's my final offer.",163.0,Alice,7,
