"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and would be a great addition to your portfolio. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming to keep my costs down. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000.
