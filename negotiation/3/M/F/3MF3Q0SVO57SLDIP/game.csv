"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly unique. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, considering its uniqueness and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident its value will far exceed that. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is a significant amount and demonstrates my genuine interest in the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  $1400000 is closer, but it's still a bit below my minimum.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1550000.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it allows both of us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1550000 is definitely closer, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget.  If you could come down to $1500000, I'd be happy to finalize the deal today.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this exciting opportunity.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
