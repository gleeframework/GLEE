Bob should reject Alice's offer. $2,000,000 is way above his budget. He should attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident its value will far exceed that. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

While Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point. Bob should attempt to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice to come down closer to $1,500,000."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal. If he rejects, he might be able to get Alice to come down to his preferred $1,500,000 or even lower.  Furthermore, there's always the option of buying from John if he doesn't reach an agreement with Alice."

It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this exciting opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
