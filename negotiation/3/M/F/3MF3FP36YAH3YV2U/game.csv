"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,500. This is a reasonable compromise considering the value I've placed on the product. I believe it's still a great deal for you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",9500.0,Alice,3,
