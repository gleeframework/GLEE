Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
