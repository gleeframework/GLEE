"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly states openness to discussion, signaling flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Option:**  The knowledge that John offers $800,000 provides a safety net. It allows us to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it doesn't meet our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below my target price and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. I believe there's room for negotiation. While selling to John is an option, it represents the lowest acceptable outcome. I'm willing to engage in further rounds to try and secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident that this product will bring you significant value, even beyond your initial assessment.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your position."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've lowered my price by $25,000 from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Holding Ground:**  The new offer is still significantly above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price, demonstrating I'm aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **Maintaining Value Emphasis:**  The message reinforces the product's high value, subtly nudging Bob to accept a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the potential value to me.  Let's meet halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, there's still a potential profit to be made. I'm willing to continue negotiations for another round or two to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement. 

I believe Bob is genuinely interested and willing to negotiate further. By continuing the conversation, I might be able to secure a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I see that we're both committed to finding a solution.  To meet you halfway, let's make it $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and our negotiations."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This signals to Bob that you're serious and reaching your limit, prompting a decision.
* **Compromise:**  The price is a significant concession, meeting Bob close to the middle ground between his last offer and yours.
* **Justification:**  Framing it as your ""final offer"" adds weight and implies you might walk away otherwise, increasing the chance Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $885,000. This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer of $885,000. Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** This price is significantly higher than John's offer ($800,000) and provides a healthy profit margin.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While further negotiation is possible, Bob's increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely the final price will be significantly higher than $885,000.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob losing interest or the deal falling through entirely.  Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Relationship:** Accepting shows Bob you're willing to compromise and value his business, which can be beneficial in the long run."
