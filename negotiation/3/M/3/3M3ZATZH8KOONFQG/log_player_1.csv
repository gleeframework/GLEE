"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, Start Strong:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,000,000 vs. $800,000) provides room for negotiation while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions you as confident in its worth, potentially influencing Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""starting price"" and the question at the end clearly signal your willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take the sure $800,000 from John, it's still early in the negotiation. There's room to work towards a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $875,000? This reflects the true value while still offering you a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Standing Firm:**  While willing to negotiate, you're clearly communicating that you won't accept a price below your minimum. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** By suggesting the exact midpoint, you're demonstrating flexibility while subtly anchoring the negotiation closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Value Reinforcement:** You reiterate the product's value to justify your counteroffer and maintain a strong negotiating position.

This approach aims to nudge Bob closer to your range while leaving room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price. While you started high, Bob has consistently negotiated upwards, indicating this is likely his upper limit. Accepting now secures your desired profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale by pushing further."
