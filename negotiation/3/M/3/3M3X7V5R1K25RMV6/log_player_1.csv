``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to me, but below what it's worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate if needed.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below what the product is worth to me. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is unique, but I still think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll make another counteroffer, but if Bob continues to be unreasonable, I'll just sell to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $980,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

Bob is being stubborn and is not willing to meet me halfway. I've already made significant concessions, and further negotiations are unlikely to yield a better outcome. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
