Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. My counteroffer is $13,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $12,000, especially with 5 rounds remaining. John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, which meets your maximum budget. It's better to secure the deal now than risk further negotiation with Alice."
