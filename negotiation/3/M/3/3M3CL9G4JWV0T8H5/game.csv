"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $11,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. My counteroffer is $13,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
