Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is insistent on $120, which is my minimum, but I've already made a counteroffer. I don't want to risk going back and forth further, especially with John offering me the same amount.  I'll sell to John and save time and potential frustration."
