Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me, but also allows room for negotiation.  I believe Bob is likely to counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't go too far below my desired price."
