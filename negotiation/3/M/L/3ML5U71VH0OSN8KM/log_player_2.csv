```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, demonstrating his serious intent to buy while also keeping a comfortable margin for potential further negotiation.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is $1,300,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. However, it's closer to his target price than John's offer.  Given the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price, it's prudent for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price he can afford."
