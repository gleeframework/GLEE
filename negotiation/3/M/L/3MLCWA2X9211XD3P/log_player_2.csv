"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer of $13,500 is within your budget and still allows you to save some money compared to John's offer. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
