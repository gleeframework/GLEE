Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $15,000 leaves space to potentially earn more than your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is designed to gauge Bob's interest level.  If he's immediately turned off by the price, you'll know to adjust quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  By saying you're ""open to hearing your thoughts,"" you signal a willingness to negotiate, which can be beneficial in securing a deal.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
