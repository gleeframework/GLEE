"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.**  By offering $135, I'm starting high but still leaving space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's below my minimum acceptable price.**  This ensures I don't lose money right off the bat.
* **The message is friendly and positive.**  This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm getting a bit nervous, but I think I can still get a better price. $126 is only $4 above my minimum acceptable price, and I believe there's still room for Bob to budge."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close the deal with Bob, the negotiation has gone on long enough, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John ensures I get the best possible deal and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
