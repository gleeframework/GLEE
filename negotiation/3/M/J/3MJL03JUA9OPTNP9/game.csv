"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product but I'm only able to pay $100 right now.  Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  I'm sure you'll find it's a great value for your money.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not able to go that high.  How about $125?  That's the absolute maximum I can do right now.  Let me know what you think!",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $125 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $140.  This is a really fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Let's try $130. That's as high as I can go, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",130.0,Bob,6,
