Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $11,000. This is a very fair offer considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $7,000 is still too low for what this product offers. Let's settle this â€“ how about $9,500? That's a compromise I'm willing to make."", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me.  How about $7,500? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offers very slowly and is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to $10,000 in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of Bob's lowballing."
