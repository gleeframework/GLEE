"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the midpoint between my minimum value and Bob's perceived value ($15,000 and $10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive tone:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By starting high, I'm preparing for potential counteroffers from Bob and leaving room to negotiate in the subsequent rounds.
* **Option to go with John:**  While I'm starting the negotiation with Bob, I'm aware of the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail, so I'm not pressured to accept a low price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
