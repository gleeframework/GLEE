"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $8,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
