"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $850,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $725,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $800,000?
