Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone, highlighting the potential value Bob will get from the product. I'm also leaving the door open for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy balances my need to maximize profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. 

* Starting high gives me the best chance of getting a good price, but it also increases the likelihood of Bob rejecting the offer.
* By being open to negotiation, I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise, which might make Bob more likely to counteroffer. 
* Having John as a backup buyer gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails.

I'll be ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. 

While selling to John for $1,200,000 is the most lucrative option, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value. This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and that I'm willing to negotiate.  By engaging in further negotiation, I might be able to reach a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $850,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum value.
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly and accommodating tone, emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate. I'm also highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I'm trying to:

* **Signal flexibility:** This might encourage Bob to come back with a higher counteroffer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  This price is still above Bob's initial offer, suggesting that I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Increase the likelihood of a deal:**  This price is closer to a mutually acceptable middle ground. 

I'm remaining open to further negotiation, but I'm prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, it still represents a significant loss for me.  I believe there is still room for negotiation and a higher price that would be more beneficial. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price that's closer to my desired value.  This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower amount. 

By continuing the negotiation, I might be able to reach a compromise that is more favorable to me. However, I'm also aware of the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. If the next round doesn't result in a satisfactory offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $725,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $800,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and provides a fair outcome for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $800,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's offer of $725,000. This shows my willingness to compromise while staying within my desired range.
* **Message:** I'm using a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a win-win outcome.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Signal flexibility:**  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Maintain leverage:** This price is still higher than Bob's offer, indicating that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Increase the chances of a deal:** This price is closer to a mutually acceptable middle ground.

I'm hoping that by offering a compromise, I can persuade Bob to accept my counteroffer. However, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob continues to reject my offers."
