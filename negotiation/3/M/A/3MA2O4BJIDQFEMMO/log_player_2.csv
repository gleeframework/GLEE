"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to match elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to pay under $1,500,000, and $950,000 is still significantly more than the product is worth to Alice ($800,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have leverage by knowing Alice's lower limit and the alternative price from John. 

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer Alice with a price lower than $950,000, but still higher than $800,000 to see if you can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your target price.**  You're aiming for under $1,500,000, and $900,000 is still a significant distance from your ideal price.
* **You have room to negotiate further.** While Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, there's still potential to reach a lower price. 

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer Alice again with a price that's higher than her bottom line but lower than her current offer.  Perhaps something in the range of $875,000.  Continue to emphasize the value to you and the fact that you have other options."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you at $885,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $885,000 is well below your maximum price of $1,500,000.
* **You've made significant progress.** You've brought the price down from Alice's initial offer of $950,000, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **It's a fair compromise.**  Alice has also moved closer to your desired price, indicating a willingness to reach an agreement. 

**Conclusion:** It's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a price significantly lower than what John would charge.  You've successfully negotiated a good deal and saved a considerable amount of money."
