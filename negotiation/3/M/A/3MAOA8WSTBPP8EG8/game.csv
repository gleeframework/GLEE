"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe it could be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000. Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $1100000. This is still a great price for a product that you value at $1200000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1050000. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1075000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1075000. I'm willing to go up to $1080000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",1080000.0,Bob,6,
