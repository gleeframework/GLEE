"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob is unlikely to accept it. This is a negotiating tactic to gauge his interest and understand his budget.  I'm also setting the stage for potential counteroffers and a negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway, but I still want to get as close as possible to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a slightly better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm offering $9,800. It's just a little higher than Bob's latest offer, but I'm hoping it will be tempting enough for him to accept. We're getting close to a deal, and I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer, even though it's only $200 below my minimum. With 4 rounds left, I still have some leverage to get closer to my target price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500, which is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's last offer. With fewer rounds left, I need to consider the possibility that Bob might walk away. This offer is a final attempt to find a middle ground before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to sell to John. I've reached my minimum price with Bob, but I don't have enough rounds left to get a better deal.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired $10,000, and I can move on to other opportunities."
