"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is a significant price for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
