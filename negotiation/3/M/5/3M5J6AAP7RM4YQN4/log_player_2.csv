"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $12,000. While Alice is confident in her offer, Bob knows he can get a lower price. There's no immediate urgency to accept, and a counteroffer is the logical next step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 value. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's desired range.  Rejecting and counteroffering again allows Bob to continue negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by dropping the price from $12,000 to $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:** While still above Bob's ideal $10,000, $11,250 is within a reasonable range considering the product's worth to him.
* **Alice's final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, which means further negotiation may not be fruitful. 
* **Buying from John is more expensive:** Buying from John for $15,000 is significantly more than Alice's offer, making accepting the offer the more financially advantageous choice.

Bob is getting a good deal, and it's in his best interest to accept Alice's final offer."
