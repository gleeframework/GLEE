"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by dropping the price from $12,000 to $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
