"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum budget, there's significant room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and hopefully save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above her minimum of $800,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate while also demonstrating that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I could come down to $1,175,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's come down from her initial price, it's still well above my counteroffer. I'm going to reject her offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. There's still a lot of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,175,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price. This counteroffer is a modest increase from my previous one, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal. It's still significantly lower than Alice's offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest,  $1,050,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. How about we settle at $1,110,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not where I want to be.  I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap.  I'm also starting to think about John's offer as a backup if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,080,000. This price is still within my budget and shows my willingness to compromise.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm now offering a price that is very close to Alice's latest offer, showing that I'm serious about closing the deal.  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still remaining within my budget.  Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer and we can finalize the purchase."
