"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $900000 is a bit lower than what I'm currently comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value and rarity you mentioned. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value and rarity of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1100000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this deal would be mutually beneficial. What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as high as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you at $1125000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price takes into account the value and rarity of the product, as well as my initial offer. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
