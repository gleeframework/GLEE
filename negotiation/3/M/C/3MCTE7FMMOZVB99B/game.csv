"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. I'm confident this product can bring you a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it allows for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
