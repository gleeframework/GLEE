"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both parties to find a price that works better for them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. I'm confident this product can bring you a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better deal than what John is offering, there's still potential for a lower price. Bob is clearly willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue to negotiate and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it allows for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
