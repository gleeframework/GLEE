"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable to me, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to stay closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay closer to $10,000, but I'm still trying to get as close to the product's value as possible. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you $11,000, which is a $500 reduction from my previous offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
