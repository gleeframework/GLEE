Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. I'm still trying to get as close to the product's value as possible.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle.  $10,900 is a good price and further haggling might make Alice less willing to negotiate. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the price going up or losing the opportunity."
