"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high to leave room for negotiation while still staying within a range that's profitable for me. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,400,000, I'm setting a high anchor point that might influence Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the product's value.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's clear we have a wide gap to bridge. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significant loss.  I'll counter-offer in the next round to try and move the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** I'm holding relatively firm to my previous offer, signaling that I'm serious about the value.  
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the ""true value"" to reiterate that my pricing isn't arbitrary.
* **Concession:** I've come down $100,000, which is a significant concession but still keeps me above my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Bob's flexibility and willingness to move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to stick to my budget. Could you meet me halfway at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still cutting it too close. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to $1,250,000.  If Bob isn't willing to budge significantly in the next round, I'll take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price considering the potential this product holds for your business."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my best and final offer to add weight to the negotiation.
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my price slightly to show I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm holding firm closer to my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again highlighting the product's value to Bob's business, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  By setting a ""final offer"" tone, I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 

This offer is a calculated risk. If Bob accepts, it's a win-win. If he rejects it, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid potentially losing a guaranteed sale."
