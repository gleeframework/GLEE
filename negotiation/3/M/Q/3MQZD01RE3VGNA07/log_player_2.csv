"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you and I'm willing to come down from my minimum price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her original value, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  Bob has 10 rounds and a backup option, so he should reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This allows you a significant profit margin while giving me a fair return on my investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  He's making progress and has time left, so he should continue negotiating for a better price.  There's potential for a win-win situation in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $925,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $875,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which leaves some room for profit on both sides.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $900,000 is still too high. Bob has 5 rounds left, and he's been successful in getting Alice to lower her price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see you're coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $885,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 885000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $895,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's only slightly below my minimum.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $895,000 is very close to Bob's desired price and within his budget.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, he only has 3 rounds left. Accepting this offer is a good choice considering the risk of not closing a deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price."
