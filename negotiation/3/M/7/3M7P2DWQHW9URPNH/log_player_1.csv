Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still quite a bit below my expectations for this product. I could consider letting it go for $1,950,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I am willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price point. We're still significantly above John's offer. It's worth risking another round to try and get closer to $1,850,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,875,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've done some research and found similar products being sold for around $1,700,000. Based on that, I would like to propose a price of $1,725,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer has dropped significantly, and he's now trying to justify a lower price with potentially inaccurate market research.  It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum desired price of $1,500,000 and avoids further risk of Bob lowballing."
