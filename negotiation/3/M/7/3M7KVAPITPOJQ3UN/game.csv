"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you, and you'll be getting it at a significant discount. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's the highest I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,250,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
