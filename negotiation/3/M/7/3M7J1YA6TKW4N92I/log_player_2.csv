Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. Let's make this happen.  I'm willing to go down to $7,400. That's a good price for you and it gets me closer to what I need.  What do you say?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $7,400. Accepting this offer gets you the product for a price lower than your maximum and avoids the risk of the deal falling through in further rounds."
