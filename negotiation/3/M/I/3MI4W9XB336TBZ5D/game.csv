"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's definitely an intriguing product. However, $900000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  Considering your value for the product, I'm willing to pay $750000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

After careful thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I value the product, $825000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Considering your initial statement about its value, I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the product's worth to both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $800000 is a good price for the product, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $25000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to compromise and offer $815000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth.
