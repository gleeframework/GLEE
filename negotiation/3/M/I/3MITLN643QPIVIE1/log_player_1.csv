Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering $119 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slightly better deal if he's prone to negotiation, but still nets you a significant profit.
* **Avoid a ""Lowball"" Perception:** Going much lower might make Bob think the product is worth less than it is, or that you're desperate to sell.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
