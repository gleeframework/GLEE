"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
