"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm initially offering it for $25000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $15,000. It's much better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $25,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $20000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still too high.  I'll reject her offer and counter with a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $20,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to pay $15,000, which is my absolute limit.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at my absolute maximum price. This gives Alice a chance to either accept and close the deal or reject and potentially risk me going to John for the same product."
