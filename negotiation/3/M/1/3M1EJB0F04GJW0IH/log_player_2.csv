"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $120 to you, you should reject Alice's offer of $115.  While you'd save $5 compared to buying from John, it's still not the best deal possible. You should continue to negotiate with Alice or consider other sellers."
