"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to the table.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $850,000.  Would that be workable?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings to the table.",875000.0,Alice,5,
