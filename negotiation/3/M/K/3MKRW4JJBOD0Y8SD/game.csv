"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, your initial price is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $1,500,000.  This represents a fair value for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement quickly.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept. The value this product brings is undeniable. How about we meet in the middle at $1,875,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal.",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While I'm willing to pay more than my initial offer, $1,875,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to pay $1,687,500. This represents a fair compromise and gives us both a chance to close this deal.",1687500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here, and I respect that. Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $1,781,250. This is my final offer, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product.",1781250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,781,250 is still beyond what I can reasonably commit to. To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to pay $1,687,500, which is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and respects my budget limitations. Let's come to an agreement so we can both move forward.",1687500.0,Bob,6,
