Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd find it worthwhile. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested, as I do have other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High but Reasonable Starting Point:**  While the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting high allows room for negotiation.  A $1,500,000 asking price represents a 25% markup, which isn't unreasonable in many business contexts.
* **Sense of Value and Urgency:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value and hints at other interested buyers. This creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""Let me know if you're interested,"" Alice leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer if the initial price is too high.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This strategy assumes we have no prior information about Bob's negotiating tendencies. If we knew he was highly price-sensitive, a different approach might be necessary.
* **Risk Tolerance:** Offering a price significantly above John's guaranteed offer carries some risk. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has to settle for the $1,200,000 from John."
