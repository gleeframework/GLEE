# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's a step closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate further."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below the value I believe the product holds. I have a few more rounds to work with, and I want to see if I can secure a price closer to $800,000."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  We're very close to a deal, but I'm still not convinced that $795,000 reflects the full value of the product. I have a few more rounds left and am hopeful I can get a price that's closer to my target."

It's time to cut our losses and sell to John. Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further and I'm running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original target price, $800,000 from John is a good deal and guarantees me a sale."
