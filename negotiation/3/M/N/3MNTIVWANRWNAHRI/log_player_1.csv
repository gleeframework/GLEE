Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $8,000, so he might be willing to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to sell for at least $10,000, so you have room to negotiate. 

This strategy allows for potential counteroffers and ensures you're not immediately giving away too much of your profit.  We'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $8,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it is still below my acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or simply sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This is a very valuable product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still unable to meet you at $9,000. I would like to propose $8,800 as a compromise. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but $8,800 is still below my acceptable minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a slightly higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal, and if not, I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your potential for profit. I'm confident you'll find it a smart investment."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence. I've carefully considered our previous discussions and am willing to offer $8,700 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while also staying within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,700 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum of $10,000. While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I'm not convinced I can get him to come up to my desired price.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000.  I've already wasted too much time with Bob, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
