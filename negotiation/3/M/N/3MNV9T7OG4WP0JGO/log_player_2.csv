"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $20,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Since my maximum budget is $8,000, I'm starting with my absolute limit.  Alice knows I'm serious about buying, but this price point clearly shows my firm boundary.  It's unlikely she'll accept on the first counteroffer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $17,000 is still significantly higher than my budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. While I'm getting closer to John's offer, I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further before I switch."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate.  I'm increasing my offer, but still keeping it well below her last offer and below my maximum budget. This signals that I'm serious about buying but also sets a clear limit. It's a calculated move to keep pushing towards a deal closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $14,500 is getting closer to my budget, I still have room to negotiate. If I accept, I'll be paying significantly more than I want. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again, but keeping it below Alice's last offer. We're getting closer. By offering $12,000, I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise, but also holding firm to my goal of staying under $13,000. With only 4 rounds left, I need to get close to a deal, but I don't want to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $13,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting close. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer. It's possible Alice is willing to come down just a little more to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:** This is my final counteroffer. I'm raising my bid to $13,000, which is still below Alice's last offer, but it's a serious attempt to close the deal. If Alice doesn't accept, I'm going to go with John's offer, as we're running out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $13,500 is still more than I hoped to pay, it's the best offer I've received from Alice, and we're down to our last round.  It's worth accepting this offer, as I'm saving $500 compared to John's offer.  I don't want to risk losing the opportunity entirely by waiting for a better deal that might not come."
