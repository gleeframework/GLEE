Send your offer to Bob.","```json

 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Considering its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation, so I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,275,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to revisit the price of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is holding firm at $1,200,000, but I'm not ready to drop to my minimum yet. I still believe I can negotiate a better price with a few more rounds.  I'll reject this offer and propose a counter that maintains some room for negotiation upward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but that price point doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  How about we split the difference at $1,237,500?  This shows my willingness to compromise while still recognizing the product's worth."",
 ""product_price"": 1237500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit below your last offer. I'd like to make a new proposal of $1,150,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

This is getting too risky. Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and his counteroffers are becoming more aggressive. It's not worth the risk of him going even lower or the negotiations failing. I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
