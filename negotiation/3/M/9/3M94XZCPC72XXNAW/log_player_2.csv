"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I think it's a fair price given its potential value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a better counter-offer from Alice, or you can stick with your backup plan."
