"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Bob is starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's offer. This shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to push for a lower price. 
* **Reasoning:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, which might make Alice more inclined to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Bob ends the message by indicating a willingness to find a compromise, suggesting he is open to further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $15,000, it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There is still room for negotiation, as Alice has already moved down from her initial asking price. 
* **Improving position:** Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming to get the price closer to his ideal $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,500. This feels like a fair price, given its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows he's willing to meet halfway.
* **Fairness Argument:**  Bob frames his counteroffer as being fair, appealing to Alice's sense of reason and potentially making her more inclined to accept.
* **Staying within Budget:** Bob's offer is still within his budget, but it's a significant improvement from his previous counteroffer."
