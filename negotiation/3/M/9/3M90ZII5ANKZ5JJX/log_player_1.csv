Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, recognizing the value you place on the product.  This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,600,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,600,000. This is close enough to my minimum of $1,500,000 and secures a sale. There's no guarantee that we'll be able to get closer to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
