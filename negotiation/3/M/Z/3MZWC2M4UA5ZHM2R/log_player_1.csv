"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good portion of Bob's perceived value while still leaving room for negotiation.  This will give me a strong starting point and see how eager Bob is to purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for more. I'll reject and counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my target price.  I still have 8 rounds left, and I want to make sure I get the most value possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming higher than $950,000. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject and counteroffer, hoping to push the negotiation closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm dropping my price again, but not too much. I'm offering $1,050,000, which is still above Bob's last offer and closer to the middle ground. With 5 rounds remaining, I want to make a strong effort to get Bob to accept, but I also need to be mindful of my own desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting close to my desired value, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to him walking away. With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm comfortable accepting this offer.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
