"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product is valuable, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
