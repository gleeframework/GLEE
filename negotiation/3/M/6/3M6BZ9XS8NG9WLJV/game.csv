"Alice, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value you've described. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000 to try and work something out.  This is a significant product and I'm confident it will bring you substantial value.  Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to compromise.  $1300000 is still a bit more than I can justify right now. Let's meet in the middle at $1150000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  $1150000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm ready to compromise.  Let's close this deal at $1250000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize the transaction.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1250000 is still a bit more than I can do.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1200000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to close this deal quickly.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
