"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high ($2,000,000) compared to Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. To start a productive negotiation, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while providing a reasonable starting point for discussion."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. It offers unique capabilities and advantages that justify a higher price. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is still higher than Bob's budget. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his target.  There's still room for further negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of a better deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your price.  However, $1,750,000 is still beyond my comfortable range.  To keep negotiations moving, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're both trying to find a price that works. To be transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,500,000. It represents a significant compromise on my end, considering its true value. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement, but I'm also prepared to explore other options if we can't bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's a significant compromise from Alice, it's still not a price that Bob is comfortable with.  With limited rounds remaining, it's better for Bob to secure the product from John at his budget-friendly price of $1,200,000."
