"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Start:** We're starting significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly.
* **Gauge Reaction:**  This first offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.  His response will give us valuable information about how to proceed.
* **Alternative Option:** We haven't forgotten John, but it's too early to settle for his offer. We want to see if we can negotiate a better deal with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. To start a productive negotiation, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while providing a reasonable starting point for discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own stated value. While he's right that $2,000,000 was a high starting point, his counteroffer is likely a tactic to see how low you might go. Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to:

* **Demonstrate Value:**  You can now reinforce the product's worth to Bob, justifying a higher price. 
* **Negotiate Towards Middle Ground:** By rejecting his low offer, you signal your willingness to negotiate but only within a reasonable range.  

It's still too early to sell to John. You have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. It offers unique capabilities and advantages that justify a higher price. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** We've made a substantial drop from our initial offer to show flexibility, but we're still comfortably above your $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Justification:** We've reiterated the product's value to counter Bob's low offer and provided a reason for the high price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to see if Bob is willing to move substantially from his initial offer. His response will determine our next strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your price.  However, $1,750,000 is still beyond my comfortable range.  To keep negotiations moving, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, $1,250,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price. It's also important to note that he's now very close to his own perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). This suggests he may not be willing to move much higher.

Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain a Strong Position:** You show Bob you're serious about your valuation and won't settle for a price significantly below your minimum.
* **Explore Further Negotiation:** You still have time to see if Bob might increase his offer, though you should be prepared to walk away if necessary. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is becoming increasingly appealing. However, there's still room to negotiate with Bob before resorting to that option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand that we're both trying to find a price that works. To be transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,500,000. It represents a significant compromise on my end, considering its true value. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement, but I'm also prepared to explore other options if we can't bridge the gap."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Revealing Your Minimum (Strategically):** By revealing your minimum, you're sending a clear signal to Bob that you're serious and this is your final offer. However, framing it as a ""significant compromise"" emphasizes the value you're offering him.
* **Urgency and Alternatives:**  You're subtly reminding Bob that you have other options (John) without resorting to a direct threat. This adds a level of urgency to the negotiation.
* **Final Attempt:** This offer is about getting Bob as close to your minimum as possible.  His response will determine if a deal is possible or if you need to move on to John."
