{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $13,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $13,000 sets a high initial price point. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not asking for the full $15,000 value to Bob because it leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If he accepts:** Great! Deal done.
* **If he rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept it if it's close to my minimum, or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* **If negotiations stall:**  I'll always have John as a backup buyer to ensure I get at least my minimum price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **I have a backup buyer:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a loss.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to reach a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $12,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  $12,500 is a compromise between my minimum of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive language:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:**  By offering a reasonable counteroffer, I'm trying to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Great, deal done!
* If Bob rejects:  I'll need to assess if I'm willing to go lower or if I should sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not close enough:** While $11,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  I have a buyer, John, who is willing to pay my minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Avoiding risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price, and I don't want to risk falling below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale to ensure I get my minimum value for the product."
