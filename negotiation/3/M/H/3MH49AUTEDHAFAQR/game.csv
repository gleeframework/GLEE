"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to adjusting the price based on your feedback.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value exceeds its worth. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still slightly above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's reach a deal and finalize this transaction.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise.
