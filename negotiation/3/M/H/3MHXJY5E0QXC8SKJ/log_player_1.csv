Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $180.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is more than Bob thinks the product is worth, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  That's still a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. Considering my budget, could we discuss a price closer to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer again, but if this doesn't work, I'm likely to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go down to $130, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll be moving on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm sorry to hear that might be your final offer. Considering my budget, could we discuss a price closer to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to sell to John and get the price I need."
