Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob's valuation) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed price).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA but provide some incentive for Bob to choose your offer over the risk of losing the deal. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting near the top of the ZOPA to maximize your potential gain.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" creates perceived value for Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By calling it an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you subtly imply that if Bob doesn't act, he might lose out.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate within the ZOPA, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** John is your safety net. Don't be afraid to walk away from Bob's offer if it's too low."
