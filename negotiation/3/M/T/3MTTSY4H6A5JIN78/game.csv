"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than your asking price, but still allows you to make a decent profit.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let's meet halfway on this.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, which is a fair price for both of us. This allows us to finalize the deal without either of us having to compromise too much. What do you think?",9750.0,Bob,6,
