{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $12,000. This is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000, but it's still a good profit for me. It's also a price that Bob might be willing to pay, as it's higher than the product's value to him ($8,000), but not too much higher.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and straightforward, emphasizing the value for Bob and fairness for me. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** I've successfully sold the product and made a decent profit.
* **Bob rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it (if it's closer to my desired price) or counteroffer again.
* **Bob makes no counteroffer:** I can either wait to see if he comes back with an offer, or I can move on to selling the product to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than your asking price, but still allows you to make a decent profit.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, especially since I have another buyer (John) who's willing to pay my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. This will allow me to see if there's any room for negotiation and potentially reach a more acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've countered with $10,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still below my desired price of $15,000.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward while still positioning me for a good profit.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and focused on finding a mutually acceptable solution.  I've emphasized the value of the product and suggested a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price that's higher than his initial offer but lower than my initial asking price.
* **Bob rejects:** I will assess his next offer and decide whether to accept it, counteroffer again, or move on to John.
* **Bob makes no counteroffer:** I'll wait to see if he comes back with an offer. If not, I can move on to selling the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let's meet halfway on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than the $10,500 I offered in the previous round. I'm not willing to compromise further. I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which is significantly more profitable.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired $10,500. If he doesn't budge, I will move on to selling to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, which is a fair price for both of us. This allows us to finalize the deal without either of us having to compromise too much. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to risk losing the sale to John for such a small difference.

Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and a more substantial profit. 

**Next Steps:**

I will contact John and finalize the sale."
