# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,012,500 is a good outcome and better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  The negotiation has taken a lot of time, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
