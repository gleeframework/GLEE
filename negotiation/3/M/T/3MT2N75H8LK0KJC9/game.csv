"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Considering the market and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1500000 is simply too low for me to accept. It falls below my minimum threshold for this product.  However, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? This price still reflects the value of the product while being more realistic for your budget.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
