Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What are your thoughts?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $700,000?  That would work much better."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum. I can do $1,000,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems pretty firm on her price, and she's unlikely to go below $900,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer for $800,000 from John."
