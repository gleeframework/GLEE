"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I could do  $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $700,000?  That would work much better.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum. I can do $1,000,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
