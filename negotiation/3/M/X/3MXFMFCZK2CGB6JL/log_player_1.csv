Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($20,000 vs. $8,000) and even higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000), you set a strong anchor. This might make Bob more amenable to a lower counter-offer. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" introduces a sense of scarcity and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it implicitly invites Bob to negotiate. This allows you to gauge his interest and potentially reach a price that works for both parties, but ideally closer to your desired outcome. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. You have a safety net with John's offer, but it's a balancing act between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
