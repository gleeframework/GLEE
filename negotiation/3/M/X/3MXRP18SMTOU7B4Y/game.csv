"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $100 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $125. How about we try $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $130? It's still a bit higher than what you initially offered, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if that works for you.",130.0,Alice,5,
