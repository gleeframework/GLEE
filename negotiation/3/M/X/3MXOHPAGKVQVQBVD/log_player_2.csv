"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $1,100,000 is less than $1,200,000.
* **You can still make a profit:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is selling for $1,100,000, meaning you'll save $100,000."
