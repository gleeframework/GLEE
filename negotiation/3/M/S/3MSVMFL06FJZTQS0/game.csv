I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a steal! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $18000. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be happy to pay $12000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is at least $15000, and I'm already giving you a discount. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'll meet you at $15500, which is still a discount from my original price of $18000. This is my final offer on that price point. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $13500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $14500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",13000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'll meet you at $14000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, and I'd rather sell it to you than John for $15000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd be willing to pay $12500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",12500.0,Bob,10,
