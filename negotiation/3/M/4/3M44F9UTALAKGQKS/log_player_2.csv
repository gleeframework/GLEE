"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $12,000 is better than her initial asking price, it's still above his maximum budget. He can likely get a better deal by counter-offering or going to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to go down to $11,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value to me is still higher than that, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,000 is a step closer to his budget, he's still better off either countering again or buying from John."

If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9500}
