"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to stay below his $800,000 budget, but he also needs to give Alice a reason to continue negotiations.
* **Aggressive Counter:** A lower counteroffer of $850,000 demonstrates Bob's serious intent to buy while showing a willingness to negotiate aggressively.
* **Potential for Compromise:** This price leaves some room for Alice to come down without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still above Bob's budget of $800,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for her to come down further.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice and prevents Bob from potentially settling too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is a compromise,  splitting the difference between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer. 
* **Showing Good Faith:** It demonstrates that Bob is taking Alice's offer seriously and is willing to move closer to her desired price.
* **Staying Within Budget Limits:** While it's still above Bob's ideal price, it's significantly closer to his budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Budget:** Alice's offer is very close to Bob's maximum budget, leaving very little room for further negotiation. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to stick to her price point.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The potential for further savings is minimal compared to the risk of not closing the deal.  John's offer provides a guaranteed price within budget, eliminating the risk of the negotiation failing."
