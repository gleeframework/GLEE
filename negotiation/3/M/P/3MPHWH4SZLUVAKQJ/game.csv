"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my own needs. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up a bit, but $8,800 is still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $9,200 as a final offer. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",9200.0,Alice,5,
