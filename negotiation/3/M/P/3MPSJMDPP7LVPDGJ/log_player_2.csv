"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. 
* Buying from John for $10,000 is a viable option, but Bob should explore negotiation with Alice first to try to save even more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* While it's closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.
* It's worth trying to counteroffer again to see if Alice is willing to lower the price further. 
* Buying from John for $10,000 is still a safe option, but Bob should continue trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can secure a better deal."
