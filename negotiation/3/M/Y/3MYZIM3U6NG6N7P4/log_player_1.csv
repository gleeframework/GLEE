{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $150.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation since Bob's value is lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to buy it for $125. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I can likely do better by countering.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more, how about $135?  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $135, but I'm still aiming for $125. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $130.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $130 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
