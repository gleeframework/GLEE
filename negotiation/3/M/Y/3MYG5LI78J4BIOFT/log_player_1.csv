Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal.  Since you have a strong fallback option, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will deliver significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the potential benefits it holds for your specific needs."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You're not starting with a lowball offer, showcasing the product's value.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits,"" subtly reminding Bob why he's interested.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're positioning it as ""fair.""
* **Leaving Room:** While high, the price still offers Bob a $100,000 discount from his perceived value, potentially making him more likely to accept.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could explore other options, like a slightly lower price with a faster closing deadline to create urgency."
