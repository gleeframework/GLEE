"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget than $18,000, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I want to stick to my initial offer of $10,000 and see if Alice will come down further.  There's still plenty of time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the lowest price I can accept. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,000 is still above my budget.  However, I'm going to try one more counteroffer before going with John. If Alice is serious about selling, I might be able to get a better price.  It's a risk, but I have one round left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to make one more offer: $13,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. We are nearing the end of our negotiations, and with only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk not getting the product at all.  I'm going to buy from John, who has consistently offered a price within my budget."
