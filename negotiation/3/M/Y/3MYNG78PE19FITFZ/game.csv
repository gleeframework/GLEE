"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the lowest price I can accept. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to make one more offer: $13,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",13000.0,Alice,7,
