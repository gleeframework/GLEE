"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a fair price. My starting offer is $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:Alice's starting offer is a bit high considering her perceived value of the product ($120). There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a good deal for you, considering what the product is worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: While $125 is better than the initial offer, it's still above Alice's perceived value. There's room for negotiation, and getting closer to $110 would be ideal."
