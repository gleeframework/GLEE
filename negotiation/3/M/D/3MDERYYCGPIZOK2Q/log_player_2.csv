"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a very competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject the offer. The product is worth $8,000 to me, so Alice's offer is $4,000 too high. I'll look for a better deal.
