"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1025000. This price is still beneficial to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
