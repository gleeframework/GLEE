Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves a small buffer if Bob wants to negotiate slightly.
* **Ensure a Sale:** Offering it for significantly less (e.g., $8,500) leaves too much potential profit on the table.  While I have John as backup, selling to Bob at a higher price is ideal."
