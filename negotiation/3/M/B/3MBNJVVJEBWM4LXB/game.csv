"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but that price is a little high for my budget.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter-offer. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $750,000? I feel that's a fair price and would allow me to move forward with this purchase.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering our previous conversations, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that takes into account your budget constraints, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
