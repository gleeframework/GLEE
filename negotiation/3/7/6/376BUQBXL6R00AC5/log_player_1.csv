Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob values the product more than $150 and will accept my offer. If he doesn't, I'll be ready to counter his offer based on his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired price. I believe I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe this price is still fair, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $135.  While this is still lower than my initial desired price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's also a better price than what John is offering.  I will accept Bob's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potentially ending up with a lower price."
