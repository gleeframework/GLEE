Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay under $10,000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,900. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10,050. This is the closest I can get to your target price while still ensuring I make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,000. She's made it clear that this is her bottom line to ensure a reasonable profit. Accepting the $10,050 offer secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
