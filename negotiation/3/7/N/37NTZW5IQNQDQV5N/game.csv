"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. The product seems to be worth $8,000 to you, so I'm willing to pay a premium, but not that high. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we try $9,750? That's a bit closer to my original offer, but still acknowledges the value you see in the product.",9750.0,Bob,4,
