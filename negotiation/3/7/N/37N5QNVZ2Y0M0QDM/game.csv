"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's meet in the middle.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $12,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. How about we compromise at $16,000? It's still a good price for me, but it's a bit more in line with your budget.",16000.0,Alice,5,
