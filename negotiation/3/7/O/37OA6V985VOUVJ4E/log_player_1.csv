Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):** Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA to maximize your profit. However, being too greedy might lead Bob to reject the offer.  You need to balance profit maximization with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth in the market."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** You're subtly highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to see it from your perspective.
* **Confidence:**  The tone suggests you believe the product is worth the price, making Bob less likely to counter with a lowball offer.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or if you'd rather sell to John.
* **Relationship Matters:** While this scenario focuses on a single transaction, consider if a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable.  A slightly lower price today could lead to future opportunities."
