"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a fairly high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails, so I'm not overly concerned about being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be more appealing to him.  I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation, but I'm getting closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $160 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $150."
