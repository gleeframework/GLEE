Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
