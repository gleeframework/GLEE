"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential compromise. It also shows Bob's serious interest while demonstrating he's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to drop that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better deal than John's price, Bob should still aim for a lower price. He's already shown he's willing to negotiate and Alice has demonstrated flexibility by lowering her price. By rejecting this offer, Bob can keep pushing for a price closer to his ideal $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, how about $12,500?  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to budge but remains firm on his desire for a price closer to his initial offer.  By offering a middle ground, Bob demonstrates a commitment to finding a solution while staying within his budget."
