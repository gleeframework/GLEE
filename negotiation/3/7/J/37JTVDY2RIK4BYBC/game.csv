"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
