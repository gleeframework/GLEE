Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price. While you could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and the possibility of needing to buy from John for a slightly higher price make accepting this offer the most sensible choice. It's a good compromise that allows you to acquire the product without exceeding your budget significantly."
