Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $150 to me.  It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground for us to agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only my minimum price, it's still a decent deal and saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
