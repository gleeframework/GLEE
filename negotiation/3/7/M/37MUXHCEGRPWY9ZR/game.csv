"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is simply too low. I understand your budget concerns, but I'm willing to come down to $17000. That's a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
