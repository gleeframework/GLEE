Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but she's still asking for more than Bob wants to pay.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $15,000, as the negotiation is likely to continue for a while and he might end up paying close to the $15,000 mark anyway."
