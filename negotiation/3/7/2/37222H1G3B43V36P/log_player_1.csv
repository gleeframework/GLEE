I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a price that is higher than John's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium for it.  If he rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
