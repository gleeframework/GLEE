Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (your valuation and John's offer), you have room to start high.  
* **Justification for Value:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This allows for potential negotiation while maintaining a strong position.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.

**Important Note:** While you have a safety net with John, be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob. If he counters, carefully consider his offer against your guaranteed $1,200,000."
