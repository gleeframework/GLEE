"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $9,750. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  While $9,750 is a step in the right direction, it's still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,250. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
