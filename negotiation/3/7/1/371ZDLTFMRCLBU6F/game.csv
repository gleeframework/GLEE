"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  This product offers unique advantages, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
