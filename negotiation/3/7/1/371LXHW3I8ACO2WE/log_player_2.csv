Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a final offer of $80, which is the price I was thinking of all along. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
