"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth $100 to you. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's work together to find a solution.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $87.50.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.",87.5,Bob,4,
