"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you at $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without explicitly revealing my bottom line.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. How about we start the conversation at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far below both my minimum acceptable price and my initial offer. Accepting would mean a significant loss. It's clear we have a long way to go in the negotiation. I'll counter in the next round to try and move the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have a budget, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, let's consider $1,400,000. This reflects the unique benefits this product offers and provides a more reasonable starting point for further discussion."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but stand firm that $600,000 is too low.
* **Significant Drop, But Strategic:** I've reduced my price by $200,000, which is a substantial move designed to encourage Bob to engage more seriously. However, I'm still well above both his offer and my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again highlighting the ""unique benefits"" to justify the higher price and potentially move Bob's perception of the product's value closer to mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $1,400,000 is still significantly outside my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for me. Let's try $700,000. This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  While Bob increased his offer, the increment is relatively small ($100,000), and we're still far from a mutually agreeable price.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, I'm testing Bob's resolve. His next counteroffer will be very telling about how much he's truly willing to pay.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm mindful that I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. This knowledge gives me leverage to be firmer in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant adjustment on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal. Let me know if this price point aligns better with your budget."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a more substantial drop in price this time ($150,000) to signal my willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Approaching My Limit:** This offer is getting very close to my absolute minimum ($1,200,000). I'm hoping this encourages Bob to make a more significant move. 
* **Direct and Clear:** The message clearly states this is a significant adjustment and emphasizes my desire to close the deal, putting a bit of pressure on Bob to respond positively.
* **Gauging Bob's Seriousness:** This offer will be a key indicator of Bob's true interest and willingness to meet closer to my price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to adjust your price is encouraging.  However, we still have a considerable gap to bridge. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit for this product is $800,000.  If you're able to work with that figure, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Revealed:** Bob has shown his hand. His absolute limit is $800,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **No Room for Negotiation:**  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Bob.  Even if I counter, it's highly unlikely we'll reach an agreement that works for both of us.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for my minimum acceptable price. This eliminates further risk and uncertainty associated with continued negotiation with Bob. 

**It makes the most business sense to cut my losses with Bob and move forward with selling the product to John for $1,200,000.**"
