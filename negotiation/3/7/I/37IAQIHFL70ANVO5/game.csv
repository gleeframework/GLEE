"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have a budget, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, let's consider $1,400,000. This reflects the unique benefits this product offers and provides a more reasonable starting point for further discussion.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $1,400,000 is still significantly outside my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for me. Let's try $700,000. This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the value I place on the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant adjustment on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal. Let me know if this price point aligns better with your budget.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to adjust your price is encouraging.  However, we still have a considerable gap to bridge. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit for this product is $800,000.  If you're able to work with that figure, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
