Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you at $1,600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have a budget, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, let's consider $1,400,000. This reflects the unique benefits this product offers and provides a more reasonable starting point for further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still way too high. It's time to push back a bit harder and see if she's willing to come down to a more realistic range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $1,400,000 is still significantly outside my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for me. Let's try $700,000. This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the value I place on the product."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant adjustment on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal. Let me know if this price point aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is finally moving in the right direction, but we're still a long way off.  Time to hold firm and see if she gets closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your willingness to adjust your price is encouraging.  However, we still have a considerable gap to bridge. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit for this product is $800,000.  If you're able to work with that figure, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

This counteroffer accomplishes a few things:

* **Transparency:** It lays all the cards on the table by revealing your maximum budget. This builds trust and can encourage Alice to be more realistic.
* **Firmness:** You're not budging from your $800,000 limit, showing Alice you're serious.
* **Urgency:** Introducing the possibility of walking away (""explore other options"") adds a time pressure element that could push Alice to make a decision."
