Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $120. I believe you'll find it's worth the price, as it holds a value of $100 to you. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations slightly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation or allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, an excessively high price (like $200) might discourage Bob completely. A smaller markup is more likely to be considered.
* **Justification:** Briefly mentioning that the product is valuable to him might make him more inclined to accept the offer. 

By offering the product at $120, I am aiming to get the best possible price from Bob while still keeping the offer attractive enough for him to accept. If he rejects the offer, I can always rely on John as a backup buyer."
