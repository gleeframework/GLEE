"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great value for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget.  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing a serious attempt at negotiation. The message is friendly and respectful, trying to maintain a positive rapport."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I value your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, as a compromise.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  He's already saved $2,000 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product while saving money."
