Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great value for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the maximum value for Bob, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point for a potential bargain.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage with the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the price seem more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts.

This strategy balances maximizing profit while keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** Bob's offer is still higher than John's offer.  There's a chance we can get closer to the desired $14,000 by continuing to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:**  Bob has indicated he's interested and is willing to negotiate.  We can likely find a middle ground.

We'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to our initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I value your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, as a compromise.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial asking price, but still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Motivation for Agreement:** I'm emphasizing the importance of finding a solution that works for both of us.

This strategy helps keep the negotiation moving forward while ensuring I don't sell for too low a price."
