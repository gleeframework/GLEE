"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your ideal outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential"", Alice subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, inviting Bob to counter-propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant profit, it's still substantially lower than Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). Alice has room to negotiate and try to close the gap. Selling to John at this point would be leaving a lot of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your desire for savings.  However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a fair compromise considering its potential worth."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** Alice makes a counter-offer that shows movement but still holds strong to a price above her minimum. By highlighting the ""significant value"" again, she reinforces the justification for the higher price.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This offer attempts to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and Alice's initial asking price.  It signals willingness to negotiate while still aiming high. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** Alice doesn't mention John directly, but her firm yet fair stance subtly implies there might be other interested buyers, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $980,000.  This feels like a fair compromise considering my budget and the potential of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching up, indicating a willingness to negotiate within a certain range. However,  the increments are getting smaller. Alice needs to hold firm to push for a better offer. Accepting $980,000 would still leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,020,000? This reflects my desire to make this a worthwhile deal for you while also acknowledging the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1020000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Alice is holding firm to the $1,000,000+ range but making a smaller concession this round, signaling she's nearing her bottom line. 
* **""Win-Win"" Framing:** The language emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties, reinforcing the collaborative spirit of the negotiation.
* **Time Pressure (Subtle):**  By not significantly lowering the price, Alice indirectly introduces a sense of urgency. Bob might be more likely to accept a strong offer now rather than risk the deal falling through later in the negotiation."
