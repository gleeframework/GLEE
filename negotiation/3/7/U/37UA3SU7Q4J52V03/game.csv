"I'm interested in your product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1200000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential.  Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1700000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is still too low for me.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1550000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both parties.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1550000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
