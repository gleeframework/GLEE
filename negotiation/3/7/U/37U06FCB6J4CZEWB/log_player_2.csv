"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the minimum I'm willing to accept. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's target price, he still has room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if a more favorable deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still at my limit of $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  I hope you'll consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1300000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1320000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Bob has already negotiated down to $1,300,000, so the current offer of $1,320,000 is within his acceptable range, especially since he can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product and saves some money compared to buying it from John."
