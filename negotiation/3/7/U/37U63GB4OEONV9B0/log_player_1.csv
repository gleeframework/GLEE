Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is quite high though. This product would be valuable to me, but at a more reasonable price point. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement and your transparency. However, that final offer is still a significant jump from where we are.  If you're willing to come down to $1,350,000, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

``` 
 

While we could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,350,000 is a strategic move:

* **Profitable:** It's well above Bob's initial offer and provides a significant profit margin.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures the sale. 
* **Relationship:**  A mutually agreeable deal fosters a positive relationship for potential future business."
