# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this offer reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is quite high though. This product would be valuable to me, but at a more reasonable price point. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,900,000. This reflects a more realistic valuation while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price. To be transparent, I have another offer for $1,500,000, but I'd prefer to close this deal with you. My final offer is $1,650,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Alice is signaling that she has another offer close to her valuation and this is her ""final offer"".  While this may be a bluff, we're still significantly above our budget and should try to push her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement and your transparency. However, that final offer is still a significant jump from where we are.  If you're willing to come down to $1,350,000, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Show understanding:** Acknowledging Alice's position and use of ""final offer"" helps maintain a good negotiating relationship. 
* **Significant but firm counter:** A jump of $150,000 shows willingness to move but also emphasizes the gap between her offer and your budget.
* **Clear condition:** By stating ""If... we have a deal"" you introduce a sense of urgency and a potential closing point if she accepts."
