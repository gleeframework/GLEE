```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $9,000 is a good starting point for a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price.  Alice has shown some willingness to come down from her initial price, so it's worth seeing if she'll go lower.  There's still room for a counteroffer to save some money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's higher than his ideal price, it's still significantly lower than buying from John.

At this point, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's willing to pay and saves him money compared to buying from John."
