"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is still too low, but I'll see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves room for you to profit handsomely from this investment. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think it's a reasonable compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $920,000 is closer to my target, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $920,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $935,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product's value. Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 935000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $930,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go above $930,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping to get closer to $950,000, $930,000 is still a good profit for me. I've made a decent amount of progress in the negotiation, and it's getting risky to continue pushing for a higher price. If I keep rejecting Bob, he might walk away, and I'd be forced to sell to John for a much lower price."
