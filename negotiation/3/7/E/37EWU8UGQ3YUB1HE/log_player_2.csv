"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and the product is worth $100 to you, accepting Alice's offer at $90 is not the best option. You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's still within your budget and leaves some room for negotiation. It's also a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $90."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  While it's a slight improvement from her previous offer, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $87. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good deal. It's a compromise between my previous offer and her latest counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting worse. Even though we're only halfway through the rounds, it's better to continue negotiating rather than accepting a price higher than what I'm willing to pay.  John is still an option if I can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to $89.  While Alice keeps pushing for a higher price, I'm holding firm. I'm trying to find a middle ground and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer keeps increasing.  It's getting closer to John's price, but I'm still not willing to accept it.  I have three more rounds to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offers keep increasing, but my goal is to minimize my cost.  I'm increasing my offer to $90, which is still cheaper than John's price and only slightly higher than my previous offer. It's a small compromise to see if I can reach an agreement with Alice before I have to resort to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offers keep getting worse.  With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely I can get a better deal from her.  John's price of $100 is still within my budget, and I can secure the product without risking further negotiation with Alice. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
