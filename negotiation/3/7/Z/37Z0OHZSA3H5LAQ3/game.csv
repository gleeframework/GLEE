"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,500? I believe this would still provide me with a valuable product without exceeding my financial limits.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my request. While $9,000 is closer to what I was hoping for, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $8,800? This would allow us both to reach a compromise that respects our respective positions.",8800.0,Bob,4,
