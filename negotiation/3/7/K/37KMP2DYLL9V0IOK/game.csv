"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $75? That's closer to your price and would be a good deal for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a good deal, Bob, but $75 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is a great compromise. It's still a good deal for you, and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal!",100.0,Alice,5,
