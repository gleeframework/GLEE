Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000. 

**The Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Targeting Bob's Upper Limit:**  This offer is significantly below Bob's maximum valuation, making it appealing.
* **Securing a Premium:** You're still securing a $150,000 premium over your guaranteed offer from John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiating style or how much he might be willing to go over his perceived value for a good deal.  If you had more information about Bob, you could adjust the offer accordingly."
