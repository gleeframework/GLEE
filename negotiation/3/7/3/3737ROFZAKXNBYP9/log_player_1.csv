{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $125. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's halfway between my minimum price and what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives him a good deal and leaves room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is my minimum, I can still try to get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a price that's still higher than my minimum but lower than my initial offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my minimum price, and it's a good deal for both of us. I'd rather sell it to Bob than John for a slightly lower price."
