"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has immense potential for you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $1.5 million to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above what the product is worth to you ($1,500,000).  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend less than $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. While $1100000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is still a good deal for you.  It's lower than what you're willing to pay from John and closer to your ideal price point.  Accepting this offer minimizes your risk of the negotiation going on longer and potentially ending with a worse deal."
