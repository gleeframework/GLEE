"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's true value and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're still interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000, so I'll offer $950,000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
