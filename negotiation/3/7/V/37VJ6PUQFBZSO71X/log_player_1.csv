{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Not too high:** $14,000 is significantly less than my minimum, so I have room to drop the price if necessary.
* **Positive tone:**  I want to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage Bob to see the value in my product. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also ensuring the negotiation continues and I don't immediately lose Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob is on a tight budget, he expressed interest in the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000. This allows me to be firm in my negotiation with Bob without the pressure of immediate financial loss.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and attempt to reach a more profitable agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,500. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price. This helps remind Bob that he's getting a good deal, even at $13,000.
* **Seeking compromise:**  I explicitly state that I'm looking for a middle ground. This encourages Bob to continue negotiating and come up with a mutually acceptable price.

By offering $13,000, I'm taking a step towards Bob while still staying above my minimum price. This approach aims to keep the negotiation going and increase the likelihood of a successful sale at a more favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential to get closer:** Bob seems motivated to buy the product and is willing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to push for a higher price. 
* **John remains a safety net:** I can still sell to John for $15,000, giving me the luxury of being more assertive in my negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price range and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see that you're very interested in the product. While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $13,500. It's a fair price for the value it brings, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm:**  $13,500 is still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum price. I want to show that I'm not willing to accept a price that's too far below my desired range.
* **Focusing on value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price and remind Bob of the benefits he'll gain from owning it.
* **Offering a compromise:** By suggesting a price that's a midpoint between our previous offers, I'm aiming to signal that I'm still willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** I'm posing a question to Bob, inviting him to respond and continue the negotiation process.

This counteroffer balances my desire for a higher price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. It's a calculated risk, but it could lead to a deal that's closer to my desired outcome."
