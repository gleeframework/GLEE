"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see that you're very interested in the product. While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $13,500. It's a fair price for the value it brings, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,5,
