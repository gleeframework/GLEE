"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is less than Alice's value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is closer to his limit, he can still try to negotiate further. It's possible that Alice might be willing to come down a bit more, or Bob might be able to secure a better deal with John if he doesn't accept this offer."
