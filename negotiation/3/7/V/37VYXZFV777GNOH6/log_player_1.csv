Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The knowledge of John's offer gives me a safety net and allows me to walk away if negotiations become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my floor of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.
* **John as a backup:**  The fact that John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm  lowering my price to $13,000,  showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. This also allows for more room to negotiate if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to emphasize why $13,000 is a fair price. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on a ""fair deal"" to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $12,750. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $12,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my floor.
* **Risk of further lowering the price:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to further price reductions, and I might end up with a deal significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum goal. It's a safer and more reliable option."
