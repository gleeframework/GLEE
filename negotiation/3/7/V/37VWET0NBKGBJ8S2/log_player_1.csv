Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above your minimum price of $150.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100), so he's getting what he might consider a ""deal."" 

This strategy aims to balance getting the best price from Bob while still making the sale likely."
