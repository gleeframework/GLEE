Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This approach allows for a potential back and forth, potentially leading to a higher final price.
* **Having an alternative:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $13,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum:**  $13,000 is higher than my floor of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for a higher price:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $14,000.
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** While John is a safe alternative, I'm still hopeful of getting a better deal with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for $13,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's in the middle of my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm still reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the fairness of my price.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  This offer is still above my $12,000 floor, so I'm not risking a bad deal.

By making a counteroffer that's closer to my initial price, I'm hoping to close the gap and reach a mutually agreeable outcome."
