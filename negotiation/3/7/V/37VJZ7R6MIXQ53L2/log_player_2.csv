"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than the $15,000 John is asking, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $13,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for $13,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,500 is still lower than what Bob would pay John ($15,000).
*  This is a good deal for Bob, as he is saving $1,500 compared to buying from John. 
* It's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price, so accepting this offer is the best option."
