{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point, and I'll adjust my offer based on Bob's response. I'm starting with a relatively high price, considering my minimum acceptable price is $150, but I'm open to negotiation to try and maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's at my minimum acceptable price. While I'm happy to sell to him for $150, I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $150 is a little too low for me, but I'm flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $175?  That's still a great price for such a unique product!"", ""product_price"": 175} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $162.50. This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying the product from John for $150. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $162.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $162.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $162.50 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my initial asking price of $200 than John's offer.  While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out completely.  I'm accepting his offer."
