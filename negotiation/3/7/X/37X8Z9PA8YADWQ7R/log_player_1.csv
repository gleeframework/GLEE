Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,150,000 is more than your minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob's estimated value of $1,200,000 gives you space to negotiate a price closer to your ideal price. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It demonstrates you value the product and are confident in its worth.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1050000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than the value I place on the product. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000.  I believe the product's value warrants a higher price, especially considering your initial interest.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's still above your minimum:** $1,100,000 is higher than your minimum price of $1,000,000, ensuring you won't lose money by selling to John.
* **It moves closer to Bob's offer:** It shows you are willing to negotiate and find a common ground.
* **It positions you for a potential win:** If Bob accepts, you get a good price. If he rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his next counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Based on my assessment of the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1075000. I hope this proposal is within the range that you're comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and higher than what John is offering. To avoid further negotiation and potential loss, it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
