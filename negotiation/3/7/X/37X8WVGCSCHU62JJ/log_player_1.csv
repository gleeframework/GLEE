Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong offer that leaves me with a $300,000 profit. It's also a price point that might be attractive enough for Bob to accept, given that it's significantly below my minimum and still provides me a good return. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** This initial offer opens the door for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price that works well for both of us."
