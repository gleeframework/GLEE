Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is the right price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,900,000, but I'm also open to considering a slightly higher price if you're willing to meet me halfway on the value of the product. Can you consider $1,950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000

""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer is quite close to my target, and continuing to push might make him walk away. It's better to secure a sure $1,950,000 than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to settle for John's $1,500,000."
