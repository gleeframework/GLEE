"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet in the middle at $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $15000 is still a little low for me. How about $16500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14000. Can we meet in the middle at $14750?",14750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $14750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $15500 for this to be worthwhile. Let's meet halfway there.",15500.0,Alice,5,
