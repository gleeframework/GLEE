Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate if Bob is interested but wants a lower price. It also allows me to gauge his interest and understand his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can do better. I want to see if I can push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still trying to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  He's sticking with his price of $120, and while I'd prefer more, it's a decent amount and I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  It's also better than selling to John for $100."
