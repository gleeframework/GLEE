"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in this product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we consider $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this negotiation, and I'm still willing to work towards a deal.  To be transparent, I have other interested parties. However, I value our conversation. How about we settle at $850,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
