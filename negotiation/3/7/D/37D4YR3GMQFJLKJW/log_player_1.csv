Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to accept it, and I want to continue negotiating.  I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but shows I'm willing to be flexible and come down a bit. It's also closer to my desired price.  I believe this price is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I think I can still get a higher price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm offering $925,000. This is a compromise that demonstrates I'm willing to meet halfway.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept my offer."
