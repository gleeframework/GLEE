{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). It gives Bob a good deal while still ensuring I earn a profit. 
* **The message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, making it seem like a good deal for him.

This offer balances my need to get a good price with the risk of losing the sale to John.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept the offer."
