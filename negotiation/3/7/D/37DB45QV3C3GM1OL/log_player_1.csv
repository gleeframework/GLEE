{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting ripped off.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate upwards if necessary. 
* **It's a strong first offer:** This shows you're serious about selling and not just wasting time.

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response and your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm only willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000.  
* **Showing flexibility:** It demonstrates a willingness to compromise and reach a deal.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $1,125,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while ensuring I don't lose out on too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a good price for both of us and hopefully, we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for less.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his current offer, aiming to find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,100,000. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $1,110,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above Bob's latest offer.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while ensuring I don't lose out on too much value."
