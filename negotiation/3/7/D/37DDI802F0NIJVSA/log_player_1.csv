{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $120. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm also keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you consider $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range. I'm hoping that I can push him a little higher with a counteroffer."
