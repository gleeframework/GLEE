"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I think is a fair starting point considering its value to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit rich for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer you a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to get a good deal, but also shows that I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle this right now at $825,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I can offer you a price of $875,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. If this is still not acceptable to you, I may need to consider other options.",875000.0,Alice,7,
