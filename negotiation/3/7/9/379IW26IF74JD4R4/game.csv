,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $13,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $16,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's fair to me. Let's make this happen.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit shy of my budget. How about $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $14,500 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $15,250?  This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our expectations.  Let's close this deal.",15250.0,Alice,5,
