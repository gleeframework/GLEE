Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can push for a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $14,500 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $15,250?  This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our expectations.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15250}

I've decided to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob,  the negotiations are getting  too tedious and I don't think I'll be able to get the price I want from him. It's time to move on and secure a sale with John."
