"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $11,500 for it.  It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to get a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
