# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
