Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
