Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product for $11,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's already gotten the price down significantly, and Alice seems unwilling to budge further. It's getting close to his limit, and continuing to negotiate risks him losing the deal. At this point, it's better to secure the product at a price that's still within his budget."
