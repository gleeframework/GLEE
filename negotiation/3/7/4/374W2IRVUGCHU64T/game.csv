"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product for a fair price. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value the product brings.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a significant step towards your price. Let's work together to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll give you a slightly better deal. I'm counteroffering $975,000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising my minimum price. Let's see if we can make it work.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still a bit higher than my target. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering $975,000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll include a 1-year warranty on the product, which is a $20,000 value. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,7,
