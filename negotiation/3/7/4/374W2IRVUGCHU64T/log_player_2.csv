"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product for a fair price. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's crucial to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, demonstrating his firm commitment to staying within his budget.  $850,000 is a considerable drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still a potential profit for Alice. This counteroffer sets the stage for a negotiation that could lead to a mutually acceptable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $950,000 is still above Bob's target. He's determined to save as much as possible and secure the best deal. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a significant step towards your price. Let's work together to bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway again, demonstrating his commitment to reaching an agreement.  He's increased his offer to $900,000, showing that he's willing to pay more but is still trying to stay within his target range. This move is a strategic attempt to close the gap and potentially secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll give you a slightly better deal. I'm counteroffering $975,000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising my minimum price. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $975,000 is still above Bob's target and he's determined to save as much money as possible. It's crucial to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his budget.  He's already rejected a higher price, so it's important to show persistence and not give in too quickly. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still a bit higher than my target. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making another significant counteroffer, showing his commitment to getting a good price.  He's increased his offer, showing progress in the negotiation, but he's still trying to stay within his budget. This counteroffer is a final attempt to close the gap and reach an agreement. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob might be willing to consider buying from John, as his offer is still within reach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering $975,000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll include a 1-year warranty on the product, which is a $20,000 value. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but her final offer is still above Bob's target price. While the added warranty is a nice bonus, it's not enough to sway Bob. He's already close to his budget limit, and buying from John offers a better price with no added negotiations. 

Bob has been consistent in his negotiation strategy, but it seems unlikely Alice will drop her price further.  At this point, it's more financially beneficial to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
