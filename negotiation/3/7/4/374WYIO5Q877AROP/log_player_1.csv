Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for $100, which is more than your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob still has room to bargain and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's not too high:**  You don't want to scare Bob off with a price that's too close to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer of $90 is the best choice in this scenario. Here's why:

* **Better than selling to John:**  $90 is $10 more than selling to John, which is a significant difference.
* **Room for a quick resolution:** Accepting Bob's offer avoids a lengthy negotiation and ensures a quick sale. 
* **Potential for future business:** A good deal with Bob could lead to future sales opportunities."
