Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to be flexible but firm in my goal. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly. I can always fall back on John's offer for $1,200,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target. It's important to keep in mind that John's offer of $1,200,000 is always available, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired amount while still being attractive to Bob. It's important to show flexibility and be willing to negotiate, but I'm also committed to getting a price that is fair for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920,000. I think this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is still below my minimum of $1,200,000, it's getting closer.  Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher, and I don't want to risk losing him completely. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
