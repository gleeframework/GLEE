"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for a special price of $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John at $10,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the door open to securing the best possible price."
