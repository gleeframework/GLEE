"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $1,450,000.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,375,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,325,000? It's the best I can do, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my target, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,325,000 again? I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've been going back and forth for a few rounds now, and it's clear that Bob isn't willing to budge much further. While I'd like to get closer to my target price, I'm starting to run out of time. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely, so I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than getting nothing."
