"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that the product has good value, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about $800,000? That's a substantial amount and would be a win-win for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
