"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for his maximum budget of $8,000.  This counteroffer establishes his firm limit and sets the stage for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still outside of it.  It's better to continue negotiating with Alice, as there's a chance she might be willing to come down further, potentially reaching a point where it's worth it for Bob to buy from her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to bridge the gap between his maximum budget and Alice's offer.  $9,000 is a significant step closer to Bob's target price of $8,000, making it a more appealing offer for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $10,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. Continuing to reject Alice's offer keeps the pressure on her to drop the price.  It's possible that Alice might be willing to come down further, especially if she senses Bob's determination to get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his budget limit, but there's still a small margin to work with. This counteroffer is a slight increase from the previous one, showing Bob's willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal. It also helps gauge how much Alice is willing to budge. If she accepts, it's a good outcome for Bob. If she rejects, there's still room to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,800 is very close to Bob's budget, it's still outside of it.  Continuing to reject Alice's offer keeps the pressure on her to drop the price further.  It's possible that Alice is nearing her limit and might be willing to accept a counteroffer closer to Bob's target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's maximum budget and Alice's current offer.  It demonstrates Bob's willingness to meet Alice halfway while still keeping a small margin for negotiation. It's possible that Alice might be willing to accept this offer, especially as she's already come down significantly from her initial price. If she rejects, there are still a few rounds left to negotiate, and Bob can consider buying from John if a better deal doesn't materialize."
