Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is appealing to Bob as it's lower than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm countering with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. I'm confident he will find this price attractive, as it's still lower than his perceived value and significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's slightly below my initial desired price, it's still a significant profit and higher than John's offer.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get me a better price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
