"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's first offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll aim lower to see if I can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think it's worth noting that the product's value is still quite high, and I'm not willing to go below $700,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $700,000?

Alice is negotiating, but I think there's still some room to go lower. I'll counter with a price closer to my target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to the price you're looking for, but I'm still not comfortable going below $690,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you a deal at $685,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $685,000.

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small and I risk her accepting a different offer.  $685,000 is a good deal, and I'm happy to secure the product at this price."
