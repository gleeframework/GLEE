"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it'll be worth the investment for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  You can potentially save money by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you accept it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my maximum of $8,000.  I've already made my final offer, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down further. It's more beneficial for me to buy the product from John at $8,000, ensuring I stay within my budget."
