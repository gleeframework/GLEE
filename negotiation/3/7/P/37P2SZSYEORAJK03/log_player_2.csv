"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this price reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price range. There's room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to get a better price. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still offers you excellent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, but you are still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  There's still room to negotiate, and you haven't used up many rounds.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially save you another $100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price point closer to $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is getting very close to your offer, and I believe it reflects the value this product brings.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,275,000. This is very close to your target price of $1,250,000, and you're unlikely to get a much better deal. You have a few rounds left to negotiate, but risking further rejection is not worth it. You can save $225,000 compared to buying from John."
