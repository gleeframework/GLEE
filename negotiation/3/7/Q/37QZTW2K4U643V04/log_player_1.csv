Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and it's worth much more than that to me. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $100 as the offer price. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($120) and Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($80).
* **Message:** I've included a friendly and persuasive message that highlights the value of the product and emphasizes the good deal I'm offering. 
* **Strategy:** This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer (and selling to John) with the potential to make a profit while still closing a deal."
