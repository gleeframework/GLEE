Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is strategic because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $90 is higher than the $80 Bob is willing to pay, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your fallback price:** $90 is still less than the $100 you can get from John, so you're still making a profit.

By offering $90, you create an opportunity for negotiation. Bob might accept, giving you a sale at a decent price. Or, he might reject, leading you to your guaranteed sale to John. Either way, you're maximizing your chances of a good outcome."
