"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer in the next round.  While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price of $900,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $875,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $825,000? I think that's a fair offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident this is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
