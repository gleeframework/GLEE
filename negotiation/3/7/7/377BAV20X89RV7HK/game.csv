"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I could consider a purchase price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,650,000. This price reflects both its true value and my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I recognize the product's value, my budget is firm.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,200,000 remains significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to accept $1,450,000 - a final offer to secure this deal.  This is a substantial reduction on my part, reflecting my hope we can finalize this today.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
