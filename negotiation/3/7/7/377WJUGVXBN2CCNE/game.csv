"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make it work.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $2,000,000 represents a more accurate value of this product's potential. To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I need to be realistic about my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value. I can be flexible, but I need to see a more serious commitment from your side. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,600,000 is still a little rich for me.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
