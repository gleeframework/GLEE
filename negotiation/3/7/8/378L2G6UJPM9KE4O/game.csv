"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $120. I'm willing to come down to $140, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident that you'll find this product to be worth the investment.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Can you consider that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $110. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $130, and that's as low as I can go.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $115. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I can do $125. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious offer of $115, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to lose interest in the product if we can't meet at that price. Can you reconsider?",115.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting impatient, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $115. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find common ground. I can do $120, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've been very patient, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $115. I'm starting to think it's time to explore other options. If you're not willing to meet me at $115, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",115.0,Bob,10,
