"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
