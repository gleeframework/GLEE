"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I am looking to stay within my budget of $8000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $9500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I can offer it to you for $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. If you're not interested, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",12000.0,Alice,5,
