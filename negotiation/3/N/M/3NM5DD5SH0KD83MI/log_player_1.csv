Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, it's above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $800,000. I know we both have different values for the product, so let's see if we can find a middle ground. If you're not willing to budge, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

It's clear that Bob is anchored at $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting $1,000,000 from John ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids further risk of Bob walking away."
