"Hello Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you and your business. I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing the price further, but I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, it's above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your initial offer, but the value of this product for me is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside my price range. I'm firm on my offer of $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I want to be fair.  How about we meet in the middle? I'll drop my price to $1,100,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a significant discount considering the product's potential.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $800,000. I know we both have different values for the product, so let's see if we can find a middle ground. If you're not willing to budge, I might have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
