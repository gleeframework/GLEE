Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal depends on you convincing Bob to pay more than he thinks it's worth, or you accepting a lower profit.

**Possible Strategies**

1. **High Anchor:** Start with a high offer (significantly above $1,500,000) to set an anchor. This might make Bob more amenable to a price closer to your minimum after negotiation.  This is risky if Bob isn't willing to negotiate.

2. **Direct and Firm:**  Offer the product at $1,500,000 and be clear that this is your bottom line. This is transparent but might not leave room for negotiation.

**The Offer (Using Strategy 2 - Direct and Firm)**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I value it highly, and after careful consideration, my price is $1,500,000. This offer reflects the true value of what I'm providing."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Why This Approach**

* **Transparency:** It's honest about your position.
* **Strengthens Your Position:** You've set a clear boundary. 
* **Opens the Door:** Bob might try to negotiate, or he might surprise you and accept. 

**Important Note:** While you have John as a backup, there's always a chance for unexpected circumstances. Securing a deal with Bob, even if slightly below your ideal, might be preferable to the risk of John changing his mind."
