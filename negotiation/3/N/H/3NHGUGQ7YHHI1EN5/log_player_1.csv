Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a price that might be attractive to Bob, considering the product is worth $8,000 to him. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject it. If I reject his counteroffer, I'll need to adjust my next counteroffer to maximize my chances of getting the best possible price. I also have the option to walk away and sell to John for $12,000, which is my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I believe there's room for further negotiation and I can likely get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.  I'll see if I can push for a higher price from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the value of the product. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,250? I think that's a fair compromise considering the original price was $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,250 is a reasonable compromise considering Bob's insistence on $9,000.  It's also a significant improvement over his previous offer, and I'm confident this deal is still a good outcome for me.  It's important to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the sale altogether."
