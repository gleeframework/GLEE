"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,750?  That's a significant step from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I believe we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
