"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is still quite high. It's time to negotiate for a better price."

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) than Alice's initial price ($9,500). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming to stay well below my $8,000 maximum.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship but clearly states the offer is too high. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering $7,000, I signal that I'm serious about buying but expect Alice to move on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $8,500 is still above my maximum budget.  While it's tempting to just split the difference, I need to push back a little further to try and get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,750?  That's a significant step from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Strategically:**  I'm increasing my offer to $7,750, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate. However, this increase is still below my $8,000 limit. 
* **Highlighting Compromise:** The message emphasizes that this offer is a compromise on my part.  
* **Expressing Urgency (Subtly):** By saying ""hoping we can make a deal,"" I'm subtly suggesting I'm serious about buying but might consider other options if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I believe we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice has come down to $8,250, but this is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Minimal Gains:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings. The difference between her current offer and John's price is only $250. 
* **Time Cost:** Continuing the negotiation might take more time and effort, and there's a chance Alice won't go below $8,000. 

It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer. I'll still be getting the product within my budget."
