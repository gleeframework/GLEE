"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, you can likely get it for less. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice values it at $80. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still within your budget. It gives Alice room to negotiate while also signaling that you're serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is a good compromise. It's still within your budget and significantly lower than her initial price.  While you might be able to get it lower with further negotiation, it's likely worth accepting the offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the product to John."
