"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling for $11000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $9500 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to meet halfway. How about we settle on $10250? This would allow me to still make a reasonable profit, and you'd get a good deal on the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  I'm still holding out for a price closer to $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at $10000? This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll need to explore other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
