"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This reflects the significant value I believe the product holds, while also acknowledging your financial considerations. Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. Would you be willing to sell the product for that price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and I'm happy to continue negotiating. While $1150000 is tempting, I believe the product's true worth lies closer to my previous offer. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $1250000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer, I'm afraid.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
