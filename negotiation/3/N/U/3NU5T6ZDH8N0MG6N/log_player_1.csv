"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $12,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I can afford to continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm not ready to settle for $10,000 yet, as I believe I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $12,500? This is a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm not eager to sell to John for $10,000, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  There are still several rounds left, and I believe there's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm offering $12,250.  This is a very fair price for both of us, and it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your effort. I would like to counter with a price of $12,100. I believe this is a reasonable offer given the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,100 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my desired $13,000, we are now in round 6.  With only 4 rounds left,  I believe it's better to accept this offer and secure the sale.  Continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal completely, and selling to John for $10,000 would be a significant loss."
