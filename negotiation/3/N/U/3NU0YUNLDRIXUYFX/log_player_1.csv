Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,800,000. Let me know your decision - this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit. 
* **Scarcity tactic:**  The limited-time offer creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000, ensuring we don't lose out.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. We might need to adjust our price based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
