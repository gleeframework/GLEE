Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $120, so there's room for negotiation and a potential win-win.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  You're being direct about your offer and leaving room for Bob to respond.

Keep in mind that if Bob rejects your offer, you'll need to assess the situation and decide whether to counteroffer or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $95 is still above your minimum of $80, and closer to your initial offer.  It's a good deal for you, and there's a chance that you could get a higher price if you counteroffer. However, there's also a risk that Bob will walk away, forcing you to sell to John for a lower price. 

In this situation, it's a good idea to take the sure thing and accept Bob's offer. You'll make a decent profit, and avoid the risk of a lower sale to John."
