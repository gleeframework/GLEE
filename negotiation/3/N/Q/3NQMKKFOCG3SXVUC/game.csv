"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still working within a specific budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1300000. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1325000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I am also considering purchasing the product from another seller.",1325000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're considering other options, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1320000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1320000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. After reevaluating my budget, I am willing to pay $1310000 for the product. This is my final offer.",1310000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1320000, but I need you to throw in some extras to make it worth my while. I'm thinking a 1-year warranty and a free maintenance package. If you're willing to do that, I'll sell the product to you for $1320000. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1320000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the extra benefits you've offered. However, I am unable to agree to the price of $1320000 with those additional items included. My maximum offer remains at $1310000 without any extra benefits. If we cannot reach an agreement, I will proceed with purchasing the product from another seller.",1310000.0,Bob,10,
