"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to meet me halfway. $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm flexible.  Let's try $1,400,000.  This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close!  $1,350,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This price would be a great deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're both willing to compromise.  I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's close the deal and move forward.",1375000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  $1,375,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  How about we settle on $1,400,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,9,
