"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, and he has 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is fair and reflects the value I see in it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. After reconsidering, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could potentially get a slightly better deal by continuing to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up with nothing is too high.  He can save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer compared to buying from John."
