"Thanks Alice, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $140. Let me know if that works for you.",140.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120. If that works for you, I'm ready to make a deal.",120.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations! I can see you're willing to go up to $120, so I'll meet you there. However, I'm still not getting my desired price. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'm counteroffering at $130. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",130.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I'm really close to my budget.  If you're willing to come down to $125, I'm ready to buy the product now.",125.0,Bob,6,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $125. I'm counteroffering at $135. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",135.0,Alice,7,,
