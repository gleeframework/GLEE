Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to you, the message hints at it by mentioning ""its value."" This subtly justifies the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob might miss out if he doesn't take this offer. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider before you move on to John."
