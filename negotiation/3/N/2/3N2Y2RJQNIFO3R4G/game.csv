"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
