Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I could get from another buyer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it still leaves me with a decent profit. 
* **Message:** I've tried to make the message persuasive by highlighting the value of the deal for Bob, while also subtly reminding him of my fallback option (John) to create a sense of urgency. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to strike a deal quickly while ensuring I get as close to my minimum price as possible. By starting with a substantial discount, I hope to entice Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and is even below his own perceived value of the product at $1,000,000. This is a deal I cannot accept.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price, aiming to find a middle ground closer to my initial offer of $1,250,000.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind and be prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $1,000,000. This is still a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but a considerable increase from Bob's offer. This is intended to be a fair compromise.
* **Message:** I've tried to be positive and emphasize the ""fairness"" of the offer. By stating ""the true value of the product,"" I'm subtly reminding him that he's getting a good deal, while also preparing for potential pushback.

**Strategy:**

By offering $1,000,000, I'm aiming for a middle ground that's still favorable to me. This offer is also within Bob's perceived value of the product, which increases the likelihood of acceptance.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter again, but I'll keep a close eye on John's offer as a backup."
