Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1,575,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

While a higher price might be achievable, Bob's latest offer is strong, and his message suggests he's getting ready to walk. Accepting avoids the risk of him going below $1.575M or walking away entirely, leaving us with John's $1.2M offer."
