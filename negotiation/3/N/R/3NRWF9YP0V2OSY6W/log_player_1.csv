Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your minimum acceptable price ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John at $120. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while still offering Bob a price that might be tempting enough to accept."
