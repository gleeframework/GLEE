Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're ensuring you get at least $8,000, but you're leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so $12,000 gives him a good deal while still leaving you with a healthy profit. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the value I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I can potentially get from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more,  how about $10,500? This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Offers a reasonable compromise:**  $10,500 is a midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Maintains a strong position:** You're not giving away too much, but you're also not being unreasonable. 

Let's see if Bob is ready to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$10,250 is a good compromise. It's still higher than what I could get from John, and it's a reasonable price for Bob given the product's value to him.  It's time to close this deal!"
