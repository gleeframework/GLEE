"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest,  $900,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This allows for a fair return on my investment and still provides you with a valuable product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get a return on my investment and providing you with a valuable asset. It's my final offer before I consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000. I'm a serious buyer, but I have to be responsible with my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,6,
