"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gradually adjust my price to find a sweet spot. I'm also emphasizing the value and uniqueness of the product to encourage Bob to stay engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have 9 more rounds to potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest,  $900,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This allows for a fair return on my investment and still provides you with a valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, $950,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  It's worth seeing if I can push him a bit further before I accept or consider selling to John. I have 7 rounds left to potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get a return on my investment and providing you with a valuable asset. It's my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000. I'm a serious buyer, but I have to be responsible with my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 5 rounds left, and Bob still not willing to go above $920,000, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's a sure thing, and I'm running out of time to reach my desired price point with Bob."
