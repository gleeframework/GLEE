"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that's fair to both of us. It's a good starting point for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $9,000 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000.  It's still early in the negotiation, and I'm confident I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a little to $9,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,100? It's a good compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm concerned that we're getting very close to the end of the negotiation and he's still unwilling to budge much. I don't want to risk losing out on the entire negotiation by continuing to push for a higher price. It's better to secure a sale with John at this point."
