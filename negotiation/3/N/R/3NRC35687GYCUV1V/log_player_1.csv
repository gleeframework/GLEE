"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).**  
* **I still have room to negotiate.** I can likely get closer to my desired price in future rounds.
* **Selling to John is an option, but I want to maximize my profit.**  I'll try to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. That's a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**
* **It's close to my desired price, and I've already made some concessions.**  
* **I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds.** There's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for a lower price.

It's a good deal considering the time constraints and the potential for a better offer to disappear."
