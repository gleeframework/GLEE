"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $650,000? I think that's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $775,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. However, I'm willing to move closer to your offer. I'll offer you a price of $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
