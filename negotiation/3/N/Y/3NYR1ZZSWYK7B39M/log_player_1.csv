Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $650,000? I think that's a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $775,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.
