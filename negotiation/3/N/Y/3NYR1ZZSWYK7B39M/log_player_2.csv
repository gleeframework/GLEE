"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $650,000? I think that's a fair starting point for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $775,000?  That seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 775000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. However, I'm willing to move closer to your offer. I'll offer you a price of $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth risking a better deal. Getting the product for $800,000 is the optimal outcome."
