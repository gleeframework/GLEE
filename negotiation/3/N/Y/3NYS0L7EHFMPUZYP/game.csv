"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep my expenses covered. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $105. It's still within my budget and closer to what I'm looking for.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? This is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Would $110 work for you?",110.0,Bob,6,
