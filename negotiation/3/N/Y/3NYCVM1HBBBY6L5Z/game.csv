"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,800,000 for the product.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $1,400,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you $1,600,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to split the difference and pay $1,500,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,500,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll offer you $1,520,000. This is my best and final offer on the table for now.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get close to your minimum value, but $1,520,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,510,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1510000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,510,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer you $1,525,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for me.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
