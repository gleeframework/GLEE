"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not quite there. $110 is a bit too much for me.  I'm happy to pay $100, which is a fair price considering we've both come down a bit.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,6,
