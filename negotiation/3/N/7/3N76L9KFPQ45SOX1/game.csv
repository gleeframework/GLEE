"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to balance that with the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's aim for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  To be frank, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $925,000?  I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to drive the price down, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm still making a profit. Let's aim for $1,025,000. This is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. Let's aim for $1,015,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1015000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's aim for $1,005,000. This is my last serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1005000.0,Alice,9,
