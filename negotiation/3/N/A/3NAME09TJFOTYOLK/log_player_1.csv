Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to bargain.  I'm also giving Bob a reason to buy by mentioning he'd appreciate it, subtly hinting at its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting because it's my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price. I can always sell to John for $100, so I have nothing to lose by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $115? That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm also reminding Bob of the value the product has for him, hoping to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $107 is a good compromise. It's more than what John is offering, and it's within my acceptable range. It's better to secure a sale than to risk losing both Bob and John."
