Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is attractive to Bob (less than his perceived value) but still leaves significant profit for you.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good deal:**  Starting high encourages Bob to negotiate, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This allows for some flexibility if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If negotiations with Bob stall or go below $1,000,000, you can switch to John without losing out on your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is still a good deal for Alice, it's not the best possible outcome given that Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price.  Selling to John at this point would leave money on the table, as Bob has shown a willingness to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. $1,050,000 is a bit low considering the value this product brings to you.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $1,075,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value while still working for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is close to Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's not the ideal outcome, it's a reasonable compromise considering the negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers might risk losing the deal entirely. 

Here's why accepting is the best choice:

* **Secure a sale:**  Accepting guarantees a sale, which is important if there's a possibility of losing Bob as a buyer.
* **Limited upside:** Further negotiation could yield a slightly higher price, but it's not guaranteed and the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential gain.
* **Better than John's offer:**  Bob's offer is $75,000 higher than John's offer, securing a more profitable sale."
