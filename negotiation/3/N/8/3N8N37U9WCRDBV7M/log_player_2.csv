Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and my previous offer of $10,500, which is $9,875. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly committed to this incremental bargaining approach. While we could likely push for a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller and we risk running out of rounds. Accepting at $9,875 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's alternative."
