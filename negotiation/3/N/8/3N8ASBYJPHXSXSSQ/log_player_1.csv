"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a slightly higher price to start.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $75 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $75 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about $85?  That's still a fair price for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to do $82?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $82 is a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum value, and it's likely we won't get closer to $85 in the remaining rounds.  It's better to close the deal now than risk losing the sale to John or having to go through more negotiation rounds."
