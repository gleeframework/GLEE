"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value and the market. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. This product offers a unique set of benefits, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a strong investment on your end.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value you're offering. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I am motivated to sell,  I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. $975,000 is still a significant gap from where I see this deal landing.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000 as a final offer.  This is a firm price, and I believe it reflects the true worth of the product. ",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $995,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $995,000?",995000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're very close here, and I respect your negotiation skills.  However, I need you to understand that this product holds significant value, and I can't go as low as $995,000. My final offer is $1,005,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1005000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer $1,002,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1002500.0,Bob,8,
