"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
