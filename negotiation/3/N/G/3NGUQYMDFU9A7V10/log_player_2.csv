Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already dropped the price significantly. I'm willing to meet you at $85, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Explanation:  While Alice has come down in price, she's unlikely to go lower than $85.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $80, so there's no benefit to continuing the negotiation and risking paying a higher price."
