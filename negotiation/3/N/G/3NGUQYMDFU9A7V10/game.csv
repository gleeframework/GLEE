"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product!  While it looks great, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $100 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to accept $70? I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to benefit from this deal.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm offering it to you for $90. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $80?  That way you're still making a reasonable profit, and I'm getting a price that works for me.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already dropped the price significantly. I'm willing to meet you at $85, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",85.0,Alice,7,
