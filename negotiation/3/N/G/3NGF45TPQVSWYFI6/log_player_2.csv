"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information on Alice's minimum price:** You have no way to know if Alice is willing to go lower than $15,000. 
* **Same price from John:** John is also selling the product for $15,000. 
* **Goal: Save money:**  Since there's no guarantee of a better price elsewhere, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to achieve the goal of saving money.  You're essentially buying the product at your maximum budget."
