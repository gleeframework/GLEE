"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is far too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $975,000 is still not workable for me.  How about $1,025,000? This is a reasonable compromise that gives us both a good deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I'm going to make one final counteroffer. I'll accept $1,010,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal here.",1010000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,010,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,010,000, which would be $1,005,000. Can you consider this offer?",1005000.0,Bob,8,
