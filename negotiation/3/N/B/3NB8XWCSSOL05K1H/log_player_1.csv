Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the potential returns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 5

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While this product represents a significant investment for you, I believe the returns will far outweigh the initial cost.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the price is justified. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll propose $1,250,000 again. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

}
``` 
 
At this point, Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge past $1,250,000. Accepting his offer secures a profit of $250,000, which is a good deal.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing him away entirely, leaving me with John's offer of $1,000,000."
