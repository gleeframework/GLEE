"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product holds, with its potential for even greater returns, makes it challenging to accept such a significant reduction. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While this product represents a significant investment for you, I believe the returns will far outweigh the initial cost. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
