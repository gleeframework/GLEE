,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",87.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $82 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",82.0,Bob,6,
