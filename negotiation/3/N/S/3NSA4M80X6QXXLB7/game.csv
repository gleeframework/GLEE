"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're able to offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, the value of this product is substantial. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't accept $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000.
