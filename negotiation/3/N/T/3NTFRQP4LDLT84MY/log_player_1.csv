"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.  It also tests Bob's interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, it's still significantly higher than what I would get from John. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my ideal price but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm running out of time, selling to John for $800,000 would be a safe option. However, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm offering $825,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing flexibility.  It's also a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting too risky. While I'd like to get more than $800,000, I'm running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower.  Selling to John guarantees me a fair price and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation."
