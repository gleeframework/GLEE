Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $130 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $100 is too low for me, especially since I know it's worth $120 to him. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $110 isn't my ideal price, it's still a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
