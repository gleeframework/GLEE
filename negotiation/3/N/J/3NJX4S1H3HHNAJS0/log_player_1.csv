"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to what I know Bob is willing to pay, but leaving some room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is a good offer, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $135. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also standing my ground on the value of my product."
