Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is below my minimum price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into finding a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```
