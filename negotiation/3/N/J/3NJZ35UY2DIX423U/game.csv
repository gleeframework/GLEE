"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $16,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into finding a compromise.",18000.0,Alice,5,
