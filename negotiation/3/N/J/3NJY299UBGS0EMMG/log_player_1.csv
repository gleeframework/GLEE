Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we know Bob values the product at $120 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we want to start by aiming higher.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $135 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, and we can still potentially settle on a price higher than $120.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept the higher price. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer.  If he rejects it, we can always sell to John for our minimum acceptable price."
