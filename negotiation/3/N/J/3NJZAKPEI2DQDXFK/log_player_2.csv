"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still above my maximum budget of $100. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $80? "", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer, hoping to quickly gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  If she rejects this, I'll likely come up slightly in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $85, which is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could potentially continue to negotiate, there's a chance she'll reject my next counteroffer and I risk running out of time or needing to buy from John at a higher price.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the product."
