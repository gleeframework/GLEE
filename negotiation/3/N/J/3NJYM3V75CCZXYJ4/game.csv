"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to be fair, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,175,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This price is still above your minimum, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to the deal. I'm thinking of adding a small warranty to the product, which will add some value to the buyer. In exchange, I'd like to sell the product to you for $1,120,000. This way, we can both benefit from the added value of the warranty.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
