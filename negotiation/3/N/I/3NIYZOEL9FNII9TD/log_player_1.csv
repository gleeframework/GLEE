"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a relatively high offer, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. This gives me room to maneuver in the following rounds while still ensuring I get a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still significantly lower than Bob's estimated value of $1,200,000, but higher than his offer. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm holding firm on the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum. While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, I'm concerned about the potential for the negotiations to stall further and risk running out of rounds.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum value and ensures a quick and certain sale."
