Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is my final offer, as it's already a significant discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

It's tempting to try and get Alice down further, but she's stated this is her final offer.  Since you have the option to buy from John at $10,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price."
