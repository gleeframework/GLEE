"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point you've proposed is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers unique advantages and a strong ROI. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could consider a price of $1,100,000.  This offer represents a fair value for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and try to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and its potential return on investment for your specific needs."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,150,000. However, I need you to meet me closer to my price point to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are now getting close to John's offer. However, Bob has steadily increased his offer throughout the negotiation, signaling willingness to pay more. Let's hold firm one more round and see if we can push him closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this final push -  I'm willing to accept $1,225,000. This is my best and final offer."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're now strategically positioning ourselves just above John's offer. By stating it's our best and final offer, we're adding pressure for Bob to accept. It's a calculated risk, but with the potential for a significantly higher profit than John's deal."
