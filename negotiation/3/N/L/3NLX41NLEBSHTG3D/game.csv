"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for this type of product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1600000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1400000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my limits.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1400000. How about we meet you halfway again, at $1500000? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
