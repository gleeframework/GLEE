"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. It's an innovative solution that has been designed to revolutionize the industry. Given its high value to us, we're offering it to you at an exclusive price of $1200000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's plenty of room to bargain before I need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of your product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which would be a good starting point for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This shows I'm serious about negotiation.
* **Fairness:** $900,000 is a good middle ground. It leaves plenty of room for both of us to compromise. 
* **Rationale:**  My message highlights the product's value while also expressing my budget constraints. This sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I believe we can find a middle ground. I am willing to consider your offer but need to adjust the price slightly. My counteroffer is $950000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is very close to my initial counteroffer of $900,000. This is a good deal for me considering my budget, and further negotiation may not yield significant savings. Accepting the offer will allow me to secure the product at a favorable price."
