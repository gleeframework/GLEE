"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,500 is still quite a bit below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. There's a possibility to negotiate further, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, $10,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is determined to stay within his budget of $10,000.  Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above that. While there's a chance of further negotiation, there's also a risk of Alice continuing to reject offers, potentially leading to a stalemate.  

It's more efficient and predictable for Bob to purchase the product from John for $10,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
