"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,500 is still quite a bit below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, $10,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
