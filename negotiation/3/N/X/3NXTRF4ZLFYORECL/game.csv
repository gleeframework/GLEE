"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product you're offering, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you halfway at $140. Would that work for you?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still believe we can find a solution within my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable going as low as $130, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $135? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this great product.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. However, I'm still not able to meet you at $135. Would it be possible to consider $130 as the final price?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm not going to sell it to you for $130.",135.0,Alice,7,
