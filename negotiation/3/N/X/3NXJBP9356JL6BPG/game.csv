"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $95. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
