"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer of $110 is still above your maximum budget of $80.  You have room to negotiate a better price, so it's worth rejecting the initial offer and attempting to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $110 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start strong and show Alice that you're serious about saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your target price of $80. You can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially even reach your desired price. You have several rounds left, so rejecting this offer and pushing for a lower price is still a good strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's split the difference and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about buying the product but also serious about getting a good price.  It's a reasonable step towards your target price of $80, and it's a smaller increment than your last offer. This shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but also prepared to walk away if she doesn't meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $95. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is getting closer to your target, it's still not quite there.  You have only 5 rounds left, and continuing to negotiate could risk either not reaching a deal or going past your target price. 

Since you can get the product from John for $80, it's strategically better to buy from John. This guarantees you get the product at your desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
