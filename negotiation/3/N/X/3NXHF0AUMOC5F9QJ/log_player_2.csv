"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $130 for it, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. $130 is still too expensive, and you can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. That's still a great deal for you considering what it's worth, and it gives me a little more room to make this worthwhile for me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

$120 is still within your budget, and it's a better deal than buying from John. You should accept Alice's offer."
