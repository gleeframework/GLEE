"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.** This gives you a chance to get a better price."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $13,000 is still above the price you're comfortable with.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her previous offer, $12,800 is still close to your upper limit.
* **You have a better alternative.** You can still get the product from John for $15,000, so you don't need to settle for a price that's too close to your maximum. 
* **Rejecting allows for more negotiation.**  You can potentially get a lower price from Alice by continuing to negotiate, or you can buy from John if the negotiations don't go your way."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** While it's higher than your last counteroffer, it's still below your maximum price point of $15,000.
* **This is a good deal.**  You've negotiated a lower price than Alice's initial offer, and you're closer to your target price than you were before.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  While you could buy from John, it would cost you $15,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,800."
