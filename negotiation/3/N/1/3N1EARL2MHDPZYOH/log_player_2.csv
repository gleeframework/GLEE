"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

{

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  I hope this offer is attractive enough for us to make a deal."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum price. Considering the product's worth to me is $12,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach a number significantly better than $8,500.  You have a guaranteed option at $8,000 with John, so it's time to cut your losses and take that deal."
