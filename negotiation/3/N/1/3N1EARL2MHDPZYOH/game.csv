"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  I hope this offer is attractive enough for us to make a deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum price. Considering the product's worth to me is $12,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
