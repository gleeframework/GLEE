Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment at $950,000. Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 950000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000. She wants to maximize her profit, so she starts with a significantly higher offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high price leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. This is preferable to starting low and limiting potential gains.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept less than $800,000. This allows her to be bolder in her initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. A more aggressive approach might start even higher, while a more cautious approach might offer a smaller markup. The ""best"" offer depends on Alice's risk tolerance and her assessment of Bob's negotiating style."
