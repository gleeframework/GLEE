"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to your business.  I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
