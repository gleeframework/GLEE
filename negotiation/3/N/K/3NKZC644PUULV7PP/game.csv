"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price would be fair for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential for your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the value it offers while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential for a successful deal.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and paves the way for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
