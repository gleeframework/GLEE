Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we have a strong fallback option with John. Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Limited-Time Pressure:**  Creating a sense of urgency can motivate Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message highlights the ""unique value proposition"" to remind Bob of the potential benefits.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** We don't have information about Bob's personality. If he's known to be a tough negotiator, we might adjust our initial offer slightly lower to avoid seeming unreasonable. 
* **Relationship Building:** Even though we have a backup buyer, building a positive relationship with Bob could be beneficial in the long run."
