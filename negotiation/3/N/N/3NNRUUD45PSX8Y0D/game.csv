"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant gap from what I had in mind. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,850,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,700,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
