"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This offers a reasonable profit for me while ensuring you receive a valuable asset at a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He has a clear limit of $15,000, so there's room to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for you and closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer of $10,500 for the product. However, due to the costs involved in production and distribution, I cannot go below $11,000. Would you be interested in proceeding with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is within Bob's budget and a better price than what John is offering. While Bob could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are minimal, and there's a risk Alice might walk away. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
