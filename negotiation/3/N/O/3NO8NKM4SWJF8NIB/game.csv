"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product at this price.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's the most I can justify spending.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $110. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",110.0,Alice,5,
