"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to begin negotiations with a strong offer that favors us. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to start high, we don't want to alienate Bob with an unreasonable initial offer. $1,400,000 leaves a decent margin for negotiation and is still significantly below his $1,500,000 valuation.
* **Positive Tone:** We want to establish a collaborative and positive tone from the start.  We're highlighting the product's value to Bob and framing this as an opportunity for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product and understand your asking price. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is tempting, we're still in the early rounds of negotiation.  We have room to push back a bit further and see if we can secure a better deal.  We started with a strong offer, and Bob's counter-offer indicates he's serious and sees the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear we both see the significant value in this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,380,000. I believe this fairly reflects the product's worth and provides a mutually beneficial outcome."",
""product_price"": 1380000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer but holding firm on getting a price above the halfway point between the initial offers ($1,375,000). 
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value and emphasizing that we're aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We're keeping John's offer of $1,200,000 in mind. If negotiations stall significantly below $1,350,000, we might consider taking John's offer to guarantee a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline. I am still seeking a price closer to my budget. My counteroffer is $1,360,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is a strong profit margin above our minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob is consistently moving closer to our price points, indicating a genuine interest in closing the deal.  
* **Time Value:** While we could likely negotiate for a slightly higher price, we're already in round 4 of 10. Accepting now avoids the risk of protracted negotiations and the possibility of Bob walking away."
