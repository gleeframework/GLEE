{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.  However, it's also above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, making it a potentially attractive deal for him.  

I'll be ready to counter his offer if he rejects mine, but I'll also be keeping John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $825,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I need to try and negotiate higher. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range, but still within a reasonable margin for a successful negotiation. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a potential backup."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer.  How about $900,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $875,000? That's as high as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and we seem to be nearing a compromise. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price, aiming for a final deal that is closer to my target. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup option, in case negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but $925,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $925,000, so how about $900,000? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to risk losing the opportunity to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but I'm not confident we can reach a deal that meets my minimum requirements. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
