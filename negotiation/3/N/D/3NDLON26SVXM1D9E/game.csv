"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer.  How about $900,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $875,000? That's as high as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is getting closer, but I still need to make a bit more to make this deal work for me.  How about $925,000? I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but $925,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $925,000, so how about $900,000? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this.",900000.0,Bob,6,
