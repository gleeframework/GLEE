Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price close to your minimum acceptable price ($150) gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Slight Discount:**  Offering a small discount ($1 off) might make Bob feel like he's getting a deal, even though the price is still significantly higher than his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's negotiation style or how much he's willing to pay. If you had more information about Bob, you might adjust your approach."
