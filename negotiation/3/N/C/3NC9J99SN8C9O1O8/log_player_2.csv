"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is better than John's, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, I signal that I'm looking for a better price while keeping the door open for a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the current market."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Ambitious but not unreasonable:** Starting with a significantly lower offer (around 82% of Alice's initial offer) gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $1,000,000 limit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason, even if generic, can make the counteroffer seem more reasonable and potentially lead to a more productive negotiation. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains polite and expresses continued interest, signaling willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,000,000 is my absolute bottom line. This reflects the true value of the product, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my alternative price point. There's no benefit to further negotiation or buying from John, as they both offer the product at $1,000,000."
