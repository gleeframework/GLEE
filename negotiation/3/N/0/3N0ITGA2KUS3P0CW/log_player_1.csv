Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible since that's what John will pay.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $100, so offering it slightly below John's price creates a perceived deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $119 leaves a tiny window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting me even closer to $120. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale with Bob at a price exceeding his valuation while leaving me with a profit comfortably above what I'd get from John."
