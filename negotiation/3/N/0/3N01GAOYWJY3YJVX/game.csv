"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800000.  I believe this is still a fair price given the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer you the product for $850000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $825000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $825000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'll offer you the product for $840000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to make a deal.",840000.0,Alice,5,
