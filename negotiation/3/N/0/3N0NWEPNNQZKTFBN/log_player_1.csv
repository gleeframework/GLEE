Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not giving away the product for less than your minimum value.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation and potentially a win-win outcome.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in the product's worth and willing to negotiate.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's reaction and counteroffers.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal.  There's still room for negotiation to try and get a better price.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can secure a price closer to your initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  You've lowered your price from the initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** You're not settling for a price that's too low for you, and you're keeping the dialogue open.
* **Still offers a good deal for Bob:**  At $1,350,000, Bob is still getting a good deal compared to his own valuation of the product."
