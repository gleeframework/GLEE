"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay closer to what the product is actually worth to you.  I'm willing to offer $9500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to pay closer to the product's value to you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $11000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'll counteroffer at $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
