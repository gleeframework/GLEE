"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $12,000.  While Alice thinks it's fair, you know the product is worth $8,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation. A counteroffer will give you a chance to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to pay closer to the product's value to you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still being too stubborn. You know the product is worth $8,000 to her, and she's only willing to go down to $13,000.  You can likely get a better deal if you continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'll counteroffer at $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you could try to negotiate further, the price is now at $12,500, which is still a good deal for you considering you are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation not being successful is higher than the potential savings. It's time to close the deal!"
