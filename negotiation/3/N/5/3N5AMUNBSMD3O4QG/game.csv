"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. It's still a great deal, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $9000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm thinking of a price of $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
