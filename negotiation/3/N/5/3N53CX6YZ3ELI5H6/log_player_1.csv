Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my minimum price point. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I get my minimum value. If he rejects, I can always move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price point by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a price of $11,000. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will entice him to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum value ($12,000) and significantly higher than his initial offer. It's also a better deal than selling to John."
