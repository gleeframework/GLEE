"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,100,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little higher than that.  Let's compromise at $1,125,000. It's a reasonable price for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000? I think this price is fair given the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer. However, $1,087,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options. ",1100000.0,Alice,7,
