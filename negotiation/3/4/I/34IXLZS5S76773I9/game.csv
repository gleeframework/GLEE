"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $60.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $60 is too low for me. I can do $180, and that's my final offer.",180.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $180 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $70?",70.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $160 is still a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $115? That's a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine - $137.50? That's my final offer.",137.5,Alice,7,
