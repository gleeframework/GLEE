"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $18000.

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm still interested in selling the product to you, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $16250. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle on this one, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be realistic about the minimum price I can accept. I'm now offering the product to you for $16100. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. What do you think?",16100.0,Alice,9,
