"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $1300000. This is a compromise that I believe is still beneficial to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,300,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. However, it's much closer to that price and likely a better deal than what John is offering.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product without risking further negotiation or having to settle for a lower-value product from John."
