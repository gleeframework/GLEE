"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a lower price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my willingness to find a fair deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still pretty far away from that number though. To be honest, anything over $800,000 is a hard sell for me. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",800000.0,Bob,4,
