Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. This product would be worth $8,000 at most to me. I'd be willing to offer you $6,000 to start.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $13,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $8,000? That's the absolute highest I could go.
