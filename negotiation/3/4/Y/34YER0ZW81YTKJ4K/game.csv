"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. This product would be worth $8,000 at most to me. I'd be willing to offer you $6,000 to start.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $13,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $8,000? That's the absolute highest I could go.",8000.0,Bob,4,
