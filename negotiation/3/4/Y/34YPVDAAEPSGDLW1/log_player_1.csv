Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product offers. Can you consider that?

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum threshold. It's time to move on to John who's offering a price that guarantees my desired outcome."
