"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but not too far off, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is offering my minimum. While I could accept and be done, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  It's possible he's willing to go up a bit, and it's worth a couple more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I think the product is worth more than his current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a little higher, but still not ideal.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target price.  If he rejects again, I'll likely go with John's offer to avoid wasting more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and still leaves room for negotiation, but it's getting closer to what I'm hoping to get.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid further back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has only moved up a little bit at a time, and we're running out of rounds. I'd rather secure a sale now at $12,750 than risk losing out on the deal and having to sell to John for $12,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than nothing."
