"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance he can get closer to his desired $1,000,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still $75,000 higher. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially save even more money by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer. He's not desperate yet, and  can afford to keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,060,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $1,070,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,070,000, which is only $70,000 more than Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and Alice might be firm on this price.  It's  a reasonable deal for Bob, as he's still saving a significant amount compared to the initial offer, and he's only 5 rounds into the negotiation.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to close the deal without risking further negotiation and potentially missing out on the product."
