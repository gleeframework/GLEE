Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting us closer to our desired profit margin. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency with the ""limited time"" phrase might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between making the offer attractive to Bob while ensuring a profitable sale for Alice."
