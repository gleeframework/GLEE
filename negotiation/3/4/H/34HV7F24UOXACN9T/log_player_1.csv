Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob perceives the product as worth $1,500,000.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):** Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,499,999 would be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Aiming too high risks losing him to your backup offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** 
    * We create a sense of exclusivity and value.
    * We highlight the product's benefits without revealing specific details Bob could use to negotiate lower.
    * We present a confident, yet negotiable, starting point.
* **Price:**
    *  $1,350,000  leaves a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly lower price might be strategic.
* **Bob's Personality:** Consider what you know (if anything) about Bob's negotiation style. Is he likely to counter-offer aggressively? 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate."
