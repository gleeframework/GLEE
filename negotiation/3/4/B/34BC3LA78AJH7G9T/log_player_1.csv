"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range that might be appealing. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and respectful tone sets the stage for a potentially good relationship. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While starting high is a strategy, there's a risk that Bob will immediately reject the offer.  I need to balance this risk with the potential reward of a higher sale price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option. If the negotiation doesn't go well, I can always switch to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  $950,000 is still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. It's a good starting point for further negotiation, but I'm not ready to accept it just yet.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000 or even higher with further negotiation.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob.  I'm not willing to sell at a lower price just yet, as I'm confident I can potentially get more.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price, but still below John's offer. This will signal that I'm serious about a deal with Bob, but not willing to compromise too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $950,000 is closer to where we need to be, but I still need to get a bit higher to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer is significantly closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:**  I'm still maintaining a price above what the product is worth to Bob, but at a more realistic level.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and a win-win outcome.

**Considerations:**

* **Risk:**  Bob might reject this offer again. It's a gamble, but one worth taking considering the potential for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still aware of John's offer and will consider it if negotiations with Bob continue to stall.
* **Next Round:**  I'll be prepared to further lower my price if necessary, but I want to see Bob's response to this offer before deciding on my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the move, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation while respecting the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 less than John's offer.
* **Time is a Factor:** We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid a lengthy negotiation that might lead to a lower price or stall the deal.
* **Secure a Deal:**  This offer is a good compromise, securing a decent profit while also preventing further negotiations that might lead to a lower final price.

**Considerations:**

* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer a price closer to $1,100,000, further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Risk of Rejection:**  There's a chance Bob might reject this offer and seek a lower price, but I'm willing to take that risk given the potential time constraints.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is slightly higher, it's not worth risking the deal with Bob for a potential $50,000 difference."
