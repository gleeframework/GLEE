"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit below my minimum.  Could you consider $15,000? I'm eager to find a compromise so we can make this deal happen.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. How about $12,500? I think that's a fair price for the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",12500.0,Bob,4,
