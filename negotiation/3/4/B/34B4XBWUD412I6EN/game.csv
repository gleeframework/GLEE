"I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product for sale. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10000. Would you be willing to negotiate further?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $12500 is a bit steep given my current budget. Could we perhaps aim for $11000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $12250. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, based on my budget constraints, I'm unable to accept $12250. I propose $11500 as a final offer, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I've given you my best price, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $12250. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1000. This brings the effective price down to $11250. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?",11250.0,Alice,7,
