"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's higher than Bob's valuation but not excessively so. This allows for negotiation room while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I would be happy to sell to John for $10,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,500. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profit. It's a good compromise that might incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still confident that I can get a higher price from Bob.  While John is a safe option, I'm going to try one more round with Bob before I settle for the $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm dropping the price further to $11,000. This is a substantial concession, showing Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal with him.  This is likely my final offer before I consider selling to John."
