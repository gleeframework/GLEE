"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really like. I'm looking to sell it to you for $250. Is this something you'd be interested in?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $250 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $175. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  This is my final offer, as I'm really hoping to get this product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $175 and $125, so I'm offering the product to you for $150. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but unfortunately, $150 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $135.  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals.  I really want this product and hope we can reach an agreement.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $150. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $147.50. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",147.5,Alice,7,
