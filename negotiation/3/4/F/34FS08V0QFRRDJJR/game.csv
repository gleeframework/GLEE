"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $140. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle for $155?  I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for a product you'll find valuable.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's meet in the middle at $145. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",145.0,Bob,4,
