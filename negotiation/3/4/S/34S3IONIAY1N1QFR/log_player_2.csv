"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a fantastic deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000.  There's no reason to accept it at this point.  You have 9 more rounds to negotiate a better price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by immediately setting your maximum budget. It's a strong opening move because:

* **It establishes your price limit:** Alice now knows the absolute maximum you're willing to pay.
* **It's bold but not unreasonable:** While $10,000 is far lower than her offer, it's not an insultingly low price.  This allows for room to negotiate upwards.
* **It shows your interest:** The message clarifies that you're still interested in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $13,000?  This is a great product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to your limit, it's still above your desired price.  You have 7 more rounds, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to try and push the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  You're showing willingness to negotiate by increasing your offer slightly. This signals that you're taking her counter-offer seriously.
* **Reasoning:** You provide a justification for your offer by stating that it reflects the value you place on the product. This makes your counter-offer seem more logical. 
* **Focus on Agreement:** The message ends by emphasizing a desire to reach an agreement, creating a more positive tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, but $11,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. It's a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $2,000 above your limit. However, you've already made progress with the negotiations and there are still 5 rounds left. Since John is always willing to sell for $10,000, you can afford to keep negotiating with Alice.  A counteroffer will likely push the price down further, and you're in a good position to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise by moving closer to Alice's offer.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes fairness, positioning your offer as a good deal for both parties.
* **Urgency:**  By suggesting a closing of the deal, you create a sense of urgency to motivate Alice to accept your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $11,500 is still too low.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500. This is a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my bottom line. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is a bit closer to your ideal price, you still have 3 rounds left. Since John is available to sell for $10,000, you can afford to continue negotiating with Alice. Rejection allows you to try and push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise by increasing your offer again, demonstrating progress.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes fairness and compromise, positioning the offer as a good deal for both parties.
* **Urgency:**  By suggesting finalizing the deal, you create a sense of urgency to motivate Alice to accept.

You are nearing your budget limit, but with only two rounds remaining, there's a chance Alice might be willing to close the deal at this price."
