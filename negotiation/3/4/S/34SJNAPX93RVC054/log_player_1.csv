Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $10,000.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, without risking selling it below your minimum.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $12,000.  There's a chance I can get closer to my target by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but unfortunately, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great price considering the value you're getting. Let's meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, but it demonstrates flexibility on my end.  I'm showing him that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to sell for significantly below my minimum.  Let's see if this is enough to get him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still unable to go above $10000 for the product. Could we possibly find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum and  doesn't reflect the actual value of the product.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that is so far below my target.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob or simply sell to John for my desired price.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still unable to go lower than $11,000. This price represents a significant discount for you, considering the product's value. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution, but I'm also open to selling to another buyer if this isn't possible."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer sticks with the previous price, but emphasizes my willingness to walk away.  I'm hoping this will increase the pressure on Bob to find a compromise.  Let's see if this changes his stance!"
