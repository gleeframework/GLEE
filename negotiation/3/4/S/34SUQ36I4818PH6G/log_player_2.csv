{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  $6,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down significantly. This is a bold move, but it allows me to gauge her flexibility and potentially secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I have several rounds left, and I believe I can continue to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise.  $4,500 is still a good price for me, and it might be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. $5,500 is still too high, and I have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount. I'm trying to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay her asking price.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and it might be enough to convince her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be pushing for her original price again. While I'm starting to run out of rounds, I'm not willing to settle for $6,000 yet.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price hoping she'll budge.  If she doesn't, I'll start considering buying from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a slightly higher price than my last counteroffer, but still lower than Alice's current asking price.  I'm trying to find a middle ground.  If she rejects this, I'll be forced to seriously consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to our last round and Alice seems to be pushing for a higher price, and we haven't made much progress in this round.  While I'd prefer to get the product at a lower price, it's not worth risking losing out entirely. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $10,000."
