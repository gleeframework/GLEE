"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $11,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your position, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great price for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,750 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to pay right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,625? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",10625.0,Bob,4,
