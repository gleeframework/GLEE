"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no immediate benefit to accepting. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! This product does sound interesting. I'm really interested in buying it, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and $13,500 is still within your budget. It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and there's no guarantee of getting a better price.  You save $1,500 compared to John's offer, making this a good deal."
