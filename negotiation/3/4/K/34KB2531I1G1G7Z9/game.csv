"Thanks for the offer, Alice! This product does sound interesting. I'm really interested in buying it, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
