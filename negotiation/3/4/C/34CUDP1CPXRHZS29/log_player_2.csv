Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $1,300,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,400,000? This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's final offer of $1,400,000 is within your budget and represents a good deal considering her initial price. It's likely you won't get a lower price from Alice and John's offer is the same as your maximum, making this a good option."
