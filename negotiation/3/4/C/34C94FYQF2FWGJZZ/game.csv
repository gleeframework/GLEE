"Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90 right now.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $90 is a bit too low for me, considering its value. How about we split the difference at $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  That's a fair compromise, and lets us both walk away happy.  What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not comfortable with $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",97.5,Alice,5,
