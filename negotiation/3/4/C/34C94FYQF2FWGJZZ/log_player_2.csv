"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better price than $110, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $90 is a bit too low for me, considering its value. How about we split the difference at $100? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

You're still closer to John's price than Alice's offer.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  That's a fair compromise, and lets us both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not comfortable with $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's better to stick to your limit and buy from John, as you'll save $17.50."
