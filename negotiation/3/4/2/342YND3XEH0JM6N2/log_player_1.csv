Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your bottom line:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so that's your minimum acceptable price.
* **Aiming high, but realistically:** Starting at $20,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum.  Bob might value the product more than you know or be willing to stretch his budget. 
* **""Exclusive opportunity""**: This phrasing adds perceived value and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always offer it to him again at a lower price, eventually getting closer to your $15,000 minimum."
