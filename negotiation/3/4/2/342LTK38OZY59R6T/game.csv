"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $155. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial offer. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with a price of $145. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
