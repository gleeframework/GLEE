"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about $105?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
