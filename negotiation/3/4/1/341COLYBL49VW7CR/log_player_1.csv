{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You've set your minimum at $100, and this offer is $25 higher.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You know Bob values the product at $150, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear and friendly message:** You've set the tone for a potential negotiation, but also stated your value upfront. 

This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation to get closer to your ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your absolute minimum ($100), you can likely get closer to your desired price of $125.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($125) and Bob's offer ($110). 
* **Shows Flexibility:** Demonstrates that you are willing to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintains a friendly and collaborative approach to keep the negotiation going. 

This counteroffer is likely to be more appealing to Bob than a flat rejection, and it increases your chances of closing the deal closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $113.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $113.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $113.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $113.50 is very close to your desired price of $117.50. It's only a $4 difference.  Continuing to negotiate may take more time and you risk Bob walking away entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures you get a good price and the sale is finalized."
