"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1200000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting fair value for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? This would allow me to continue negotiations with you, and hopefully we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your persistence.  While $1150000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can close this out.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not convinced that $1250000 is the right price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1075000 for the product.,1075000.0,Bob,6,
