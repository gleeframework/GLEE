"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($12,000). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save money.  $13,500 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still more than Alice's minimum. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a lower price by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $13,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is a compromise and closer to Bob's final counteroffer of $13,000.  It's also significantly less than the price from John ($15,000).  Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product for a good price and avoid further negotiation. While he could continue to haggle, the potential savings are small and the risk of losing the deal to John is higher."
