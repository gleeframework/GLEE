Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
