Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential benefits for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While I'm starting high, I'm also leaving room for negotiation by mentioning ""Let me know your thoughts."" This signals my willingness to discuss the price.
* **John as a Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer to ensure I can still sell the product for at least $800,000 if Bob doesn't meet my expectations. 

This approach allows me to maximize potential profits while remaining open to negotiation. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I need to hold out for a better offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain my position:** This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Explore higher offers:** By continuing to negotiate, I might get Bob to increase his offer or find out how high he's willing to go.
* **Secure a backup:** If Bob doesn't come back with a better offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum while leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the unique value and potential this product offers.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintaining my minimum price.
* **Highlight Value:** I remind Bob of the product's unique value and potential to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The message ends with an open-ended question (""What do you think?"") inviting Bob to respond and potentially continue negotiations.

This approach balances my need to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget. How about we meet at $825000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's also higher than what I'd get from John. 

Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Profit Maximization:** $825,000 is a good profit and exceeds my minimum goal.
* **Risk Reduction:** By accepting, I avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential lower offers. 
* **Time Efficiency:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time, potentially leading to a lower price or the need to sell to John, which would be less profitable.

While I might be able to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, the risk of a counteroffer resulting in a lower price or wasted time outweighs the potential gains."
