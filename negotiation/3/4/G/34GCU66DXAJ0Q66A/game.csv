"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's split the difference. How about $1,050,000? This feels like a fair price considering the value of this product to you. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to offer $975,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $975,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's make one last attempt to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's the closest I can go.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",980000.0,Bob,6,
