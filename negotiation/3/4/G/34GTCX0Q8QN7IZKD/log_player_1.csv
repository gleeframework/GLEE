Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable.  Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $900,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my guaranteed value from John. 
* **Message:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.  It's designed to encourage him to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

This strategy balances the following:

* **Maximizing Profit:** By setting a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I aim to earn more than my guaranteed value from John.
* **Minimizing Risk:** By not setting the price too high, I increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, avoiding the risk of having to sell to John."
