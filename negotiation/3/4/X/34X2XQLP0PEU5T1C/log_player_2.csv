"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. I understand it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. Please consider my offer of $12,000. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a profit. Let me know your decision.
