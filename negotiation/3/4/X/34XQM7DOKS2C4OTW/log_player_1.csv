"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value, hoping to get as close to my minimum price as possible. I'm also leaving some room for negotiation, which is important to keep the deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer with further negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer.  It's still below my minimum value, but it's a good compromise to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Although it's getting closer to my minimum price, it's still too low.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11800}
```

I'm lowering the price a bit more, but still keeping it above my minimum.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I also have a limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting very close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time and there's a risk Bob might continue to lower the price.  I'm choosing to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $12,000."
