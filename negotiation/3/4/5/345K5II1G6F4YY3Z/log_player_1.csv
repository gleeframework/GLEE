Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob perceive the final price as a ""deal"" even if it's considerably higher than his initial valuation. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price leaves space for potential negotiation.  If Bob counters, there's room to lower the price while still remaining well above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price, which gives you leverage. You don't *need* to sell to Bob for less than what you find acceptable.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims for maximizing profit. However, it's crucial to be prepared for Bob to outright reject the initial offer. Gauge his reactions and be ready to adjust your approach if needed."
