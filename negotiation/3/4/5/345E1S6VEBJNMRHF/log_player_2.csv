"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate.  $11,500 is a good starting point for the negotiation as it leaves room for both Bob and Alice to compromise. It's also a price that Bob is still willing to pay while potentially saving a significant amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  While it's closer, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now proposing his maximum price, which is also the price John is offering. This is a strong position for Bob, as he is showing his willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget.  By stating it's his final offer, Bob is putting pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal."
