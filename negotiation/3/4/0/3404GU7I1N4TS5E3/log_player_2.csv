{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  He has the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, so he should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to his budget, but still leaves some room for negotiation. He's hoping to meet Alice halfway to reach a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is only $20,000 more than John's price.  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, this is a relatively small amount to pay for the convenience of buying from Alice.  Further negotiation might save him $20,000, but it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away, or potentially offering an even higher price in a subsequent counteroffer.  It's best to accept the offer and move on."
