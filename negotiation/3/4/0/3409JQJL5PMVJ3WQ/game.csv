"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's try to close this deal. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
