"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's something truly special with a value I personally place at over a million dollars.  I'm willing to let it go for $1500000.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $1500000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $800000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately below the value I need to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This is a substantial discount from my initial offer and a fair price given the unique nature of this product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high.  I'm willing to offer $1000000, which is my absolute maximum.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for a product with the potential yours has. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
