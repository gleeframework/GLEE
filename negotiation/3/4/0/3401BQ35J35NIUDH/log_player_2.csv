"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's something truly special with a value I personally place at over a million dollars.  I'm willing to let it go for $1500000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always worth exploring negotiation before committing to a price that high. There's a good chance you can get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $1,500,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your serious interest while staying within your budget.  $800,000 is a good starting point for negotiations, leaving room for both sides to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $800000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately below the value I need to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This is a substantial discount from my initial offer and a fair price given the unique nature of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to try to push the price even lower. You can also use this opportunity to see how committed Alice is to selling the product at a price that works for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for a product with the potential yours has. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer directly addresses Alice's last offer, acknowledging her willingness to negotiate. It also highlights that $1,000,000 is your absolute limit, making it clear you are serious about this price. This strategy can potentially pressure Alice into accepting the offer, especially if she's eager to sell. It also sets up the next round for a possible compromise."
