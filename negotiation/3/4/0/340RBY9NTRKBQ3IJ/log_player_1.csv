"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $1,750,000, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the value and the potential for a win-win situation. 
* **Strategy:** I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate at all. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more reasonable offer. How about we start around $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is far too low. While I need to be flexible,  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired value.  
* There are still 8 rounds remaining, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate a better price with Bob or opt for the guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your initial offer. However, $800,000 is far too low for this product.  Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000,  which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but firmly emphasize its inadequacy. I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price but still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer tests Bob's commitment to the deal. If he's serious, he'll likely counter with a higher offer. If not, I can still choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is an increase from his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There are still 6 rounds remaining, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate a better price with Bob or opt for the guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,200,000, which is a further compromise from my previous offer but still well above Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating that $950,000 is too low while showing flexibility by meeting him halfway. I'm also emphasizing the benefits of closing the deal.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to get Bob closer to my desired price while leaving room for further negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can still sell to John if this deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right that we're getting closer. To be honest, I have another offer on the table, but I value the negotiation we've built. If you're willing to come down to $1,050,000, I'll accept immediately. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have another offer, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop to $1,150,000. It's a fair price that acknowledges your value, but also reflects the true worth of the product.  This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,150,000, which is a compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's other offer but highlighting the value of this product. I'm stating that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency.
* **Strategy:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to get close to a final agreement. I'm hoping that Bob will accept my offer or at least counter with a price closer to my desired range. If not, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
