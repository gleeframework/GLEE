"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let's get this deal done!

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your initial offer. However, $800,000 is far too low for this product.  Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000,  which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right that we're getting closer. To be honest, I have another offer on the table, but I value the negotiation we've built.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have another offer, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop to $1,150,000. It's a fair price that acknowledges your value, but also reflects the true worth of the product.  This is my final offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down considerably, her ""final offer"" of $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than John's standing offer of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and further negotiation might risk losing the guaranteed deal with John."
