Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that significantly surpasses John's offer of $1,000,000.  At this point, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the certainty of John's offer.  It makes more business sense to cut losses in terms of time and effort and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 sale."
