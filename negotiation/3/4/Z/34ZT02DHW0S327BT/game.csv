"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but  $1200000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000 to make this deal work. This price still leaves room for you to profit from the product and allows me to recover a good portion of its value.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
