"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1500000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
