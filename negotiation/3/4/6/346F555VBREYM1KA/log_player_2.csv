"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is less than your maximum budget of $120, it's still more than the product is worth to you.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to pay $95, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this product is worth a bit more than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to your ideal price, it's still higher than what you're comfortable paying. Rejecting the offer gives you another chance to negotiate a price closer to $95.  You could also try a counteroffer between $95 and $105 to see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product at $105. I'm still only comfortable at $98. This is my final offer, as it's within my budget and fairly reflects the value to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $98, which is $101.5. I think that's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $101.5 is within your budget of $120.** You are saving a significant amount compared to buying from John. 
* **Continuing to negotiate could be risky.**  You've already made two counteroffers and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but you can't be sure how far she'll go. There's a chance you could end up paying $120 to John.
* **The price is close to your desired range.** You were hoping for $95, but $101.5 is only a small amount more, and you're still getting a good deal. 

It's a good time to accept the offer and avoid further risk in the negotiation."
