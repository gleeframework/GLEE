"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $9,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're better off trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than what the product is worth to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive price. However, I'm aiming to get a better deal. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $8,800. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $8,800 is still within your budget and is a good compromise. You're able to get the product for a price less than what you'd pay John, and it's only $300 more than what the product is worth to Alice."
