"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $120 for it.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay under $130. Would you be willing to go down to $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $140. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
