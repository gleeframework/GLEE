"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $175. This is a significant overpayment. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what the product is worth to you.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay under $130. Would you be willing to go down to $135?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $135 is a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $140. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is $140, which is still above your target price of $100.  While continuing to negotiate might get you closer, the risk is that Alice might reject your offer and you'll be stuck paying her $140.  It's better to be safe and buy from John for $100."
