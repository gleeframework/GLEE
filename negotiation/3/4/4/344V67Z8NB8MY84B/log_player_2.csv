Considering its significance and the potential it holds for you, I am extending an exclusive offer to acquire this product at a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. I kindly propose to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product for $950,000. This price not only allows you to secure an asset valued at $1,000,000 but also provides you with a substantial saving compared to the market value. I look forward to discussing this further and hope we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. Please let me know your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $950,000, while John wants $1,000,000.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** Even though the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, you are getting it for $950,000, which is still a good price for you. 

It makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save $50,000."
