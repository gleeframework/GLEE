"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal, as it's worth more than $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. It's a good deal, but Bob can potentially save more money. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work.  This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I think it's fair given the negotiation we've had so far. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,000 is a better price than her initial offer, Bob can still potentially get the product for a lower price. He should try to negotiate a lower price again, aiming for closer to his budget of $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $8,800. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,900. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  Let me know if you're open to this final compromise.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. 

While Alice's offer of $8,900 is getting closer to his budget, it's still $900 more than what John is offering.  He should take the guaranteed lower price from John.  There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate with Alice will just result in more back-and-forth and might even push her price back up.  It's time to secure the deal with John."
