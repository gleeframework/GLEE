"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal, as it's worth more than $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work.  This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I think it's fair given the negotiation we've had so far. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $8,800. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price. Let me know what you think.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,900. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  Let me know if you're open to this final compromise.",8900.0,Alice,5,
