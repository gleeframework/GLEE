Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I do see the value in your product, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
