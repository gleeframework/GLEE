"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm starting with a strong opening offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can do better than $950,000.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my original asking price. I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at this price.

You can still do better.  Reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer. You've already shown you're willing to pay more than $850,000, so there's room to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. How about we split the difference and agree on $875,000? This is a good middle ground and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $890,000, which is a slight compromise from my original offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000.

At this point, it's worth accepting Alice's offer. You've already saved a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the potential savings are small and the risk of Alice walking away is higher."
