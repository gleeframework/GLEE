"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm starting with a strong opening offer.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I do see the value in your product, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can make this deal work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my original asking price. I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. How about we split the difference and agree on $875,000? This is a good middle ground and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $890,000, which is a slight compromise from my original offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
