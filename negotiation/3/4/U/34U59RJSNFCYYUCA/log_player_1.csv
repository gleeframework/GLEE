Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $50,000 discount from my guaranteed sale price, incentivizing him to buy, while I still make a significant profit above his perceived value.
* **Strong Opening:** This offer sets a strong starting point for potential negotiation while leaving room for adjustment if Bob counters."
