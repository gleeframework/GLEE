"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is within your budget, it's still higher than your ideal price.  You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000,  which is still a significant amount and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still higher than your ideal price. You're within striking distance of your goal and should continue negotiating to see if you can get Alice down to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. While I'm open to paying a bit more than my initial offer, I'm still hoping to get this product for $825,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now closer to your ideal price, you're still within your budget and have more rounds of negotiation left. Continue to try and lower the price, as there's still room for compromise.  You can always choose to buy from John if you feel you're not getting a good deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $835,000, which is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and keeps me within my budget. Let's work together to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 835000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $835,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $845,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $845,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $845,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've been negotiating with Alice for several rounds, and while she's coming down in price, she's still not willing to meet your desired price point. At this point, you've only got 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will drop significantly further. It's more advantageous to secure the product from John for your target price of $800,000 rather than risk losing out on the deal altogether."
