"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. I think this is a great price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your target, but I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we meet at $11,200? I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $11,200 saves $800 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and risks ending up with a worse deal."
