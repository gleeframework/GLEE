Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.  This sets the stage for a hopefully successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,875? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,875

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $12,875 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000,  which is closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. How about we try $12,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay under $13,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750.
