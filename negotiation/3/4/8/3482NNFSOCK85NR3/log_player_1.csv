Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice â€“ this is her ""walk-away"" point. She shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He benefits as long as he pays less than this.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 to John. This provides leverage.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to offer the product to Bob at a price slightly below $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring she gets more than she would from John. This strategy maximizes her potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,175,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message doesn't reveal Alice's absolute bottom line, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Strong Opening:** The price is attractive to Bob (below his perceived value) while leaving room for Alice to negotiate upwards.
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages dialogue, increasing the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, Alice should still aim to secure the best possible deal with Bob first."
