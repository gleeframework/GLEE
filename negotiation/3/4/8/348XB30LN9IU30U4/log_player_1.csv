"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it will be transformative for you. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price, so let's start at $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting high allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a fantastic deal right away.  Even if he rejects this initial offer, it sets the stage for negotiation well above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a significant sum, I started high for a reason. There's plenty of room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my initial offer. Bob's willingness to counter so quickly indicates strong interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly exceptional.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,600,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm coming down in price, but I'm still aiming high. Splitting the difference between his counteroffer and my previous offer shows a willingness to negotiate while reinforcing the product's high value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth that much. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating in predictable increments of $200,000. While his latest offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. It's still early in the negotiation, and I'm willing to push a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but this product is a rare find with truly unique benefits. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,500,000, but I can't go lower than that."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm signaling a slight concession by dropping to $1,500,000. However, I'm also setting a firm boundary. This price point represents a substantial profit, and I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet me here. The ""rare find"" and ""unique benefits"" messaging aims to re-emphasize the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now repeated his offer of $1,200,000 twice and stated it's his final offer. This suggests he's unlikely to go any higher. While I could push for more, there's a real risk of him walking away entirely. Accepting this offer guarantees a $200,000 profit, which is a good outcome. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him entirely and having to accept John's offer."
