,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $75?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $75 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $82.50?  I'm confident this product is worth it to you.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about $80? That's my absolute limit. If you're willing to accept that, I'll buy it from you. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
