"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and creates the perception that the product is highly valuable.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,600,000, we anchor the negotiation around a higher number, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room:**  While we have a firm minimum ($1,200,000), starting high allows for flexibility and potential compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob immediately went to our absolute minimum price, which indicates there's room for negotiation. Accepting his offer now would mean missing out on a potentially better deal.  We'll make a counteroffer to guide the price upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product goes beyond typical market conditions.  It offers unique advantages that justify a premium.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,400,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We're acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Split the Difference:** By suggesting $1,400,000, we're splitting the difference between his offer and our previous price, a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** We're still significantly above Bob's offer, leaving space for further negotiation while aiming for a price closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the unique advantages you mentioned, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we settle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still too low. We are aiming for at least $1,200,000 (our guaranteed sale to John).  Rejecting this offer maintains a firm stance and signals that we're serious about the product's value. We'll use our counteroffer in the next round to try and steer the negotiation closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. It seems we both see the unique value in this product.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value and potential for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Strategically:**  We're coming down in price, but only by $100,000, keeping us above Bob's offer and demonstrating that we're not desperate.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** We're framing the offer as a win-win, emphasizing that both parties will benefit from the deal at this price point.
* **Creating Urgency (Slightly):**  By stating our willingness ""to move things along,"" we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. Considering the market conditions and the product's value, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While he's incrementally increasing his offer, the pace of the negotiation suggests it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price that benefits us more than selling to John.

It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000.  This avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds with Bob potentially ending in a less favorable outcome."
