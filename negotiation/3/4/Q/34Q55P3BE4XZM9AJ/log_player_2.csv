"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price, especially since your alternative is buying from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to save as much as possible, so we start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer and your maximum budget.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  Offering $90 leaves space for further negotiation if Alice rejects it. We can gradually increase our offer towards our $120 limit.
* **Polite and Positive:** The message remains friendly and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you in the middle at $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a price you're willing to pay, but there's still room for negotiation. Since you have the option of buying from John for $120, you can afford to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're splitting the difference between our previous offer ($90) and Alice's current offer ($100), showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By proposing a specific price and framing it as ""fair for both of us,"" we're gently nudging Alice towards a decision.
* **Staying Below the Alternative:**  Our offer remains below our $120 fallback option, ensuring we're still getting a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $98, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice has come down to $98, which is a good price and only $2 more than your last offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might only save you a very small amount, and there's a risk Alice could withdraw her offer altogether. It's better to secure a good deal now."
