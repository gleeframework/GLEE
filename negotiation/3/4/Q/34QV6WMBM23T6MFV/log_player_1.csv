Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping in mind my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'll also keep John in the back of my mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not desperate. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering the price a bit to show flexibility but still aiming for a profit.  I'm confident that Bob sees value in the product and will be willing to pay a price closer to my ideal."
