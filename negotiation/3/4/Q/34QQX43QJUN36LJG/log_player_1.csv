"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for a price above what the product is worth to me.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my desired $150 within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need to make a profit.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price.  This is the price John is willing to pay, so if Bob doesn't accept, I can sell to him instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I have only 6 rounds left.  It's getting riskier to keep negotiating.  I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of losing a sale altogether."
