"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110?  This price still leaves room for you to get a great deal, while allowing me to get closer to my desired value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is closer to Bob's ideal price point. While there is still room for negotiation, accepting this offer saves Bob from further rounds of negotiation and ensures he gets the product for a reasonable price. The potential savings from further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort."
