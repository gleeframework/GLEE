Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential."" This framing aims to justify the higher price.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the offer can make Bob more likely to take it seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer. This information asymmetry works in your favor.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can always negotiate down from your initial price, but you can't go up."
