Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm eager to sell, $85 is too far below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $105 for this. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105}

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
