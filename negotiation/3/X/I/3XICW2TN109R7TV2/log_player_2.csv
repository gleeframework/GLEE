"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is higher than John's price. I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to save as much money as possible, ideally getting the price closer to John's $100 offer. 
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** My message is polite and expresses interest in the product while making it clear that the price needs to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $105 for this. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Price:** While Alice is moving closer to my desired range, $105 is still more expensive than buying from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice explicitly mentioned ""meeting in the middle,"" suggesting she's open to further price adjustments. I'll try to negotiate a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between Alice's current offer ($105) and my previous counteroffer ($85). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Approaching John's Price:**  $95 is now getting very close to John's alternative offer of $100. I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to either accept a lower price or risk losing the sale. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** I'm continuing to use friendly and respectful language to keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $100, but that's my final offer. If you're interested, let's make this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Price:** Alice has finally matched John's price of $100. There's no longer any benefit to buying from John since I can get the same price from Alice.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has indicated that $100 is her absolute lowest price. Trying to negotiate further might jeopardize the deal. 
* **Time Saved:** While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly lower price. Accepting now saves time and ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
