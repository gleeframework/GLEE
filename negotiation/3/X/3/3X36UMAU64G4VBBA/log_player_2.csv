"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking to make a profit, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to give you a good deal compared to what I could get from another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is ridiculously high. It's more than you value the product at and significantly more than John's offer. Buying from John ensures you get the best possible price."
