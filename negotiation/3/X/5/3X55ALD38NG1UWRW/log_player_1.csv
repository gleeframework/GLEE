``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values it less.  This gives us room to negotiate and allows me to gauge his interest. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter-offer and consider selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you believe the product can bring to my business, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a price closer to my initial asking price."
