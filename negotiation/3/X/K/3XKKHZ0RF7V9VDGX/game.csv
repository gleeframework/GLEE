"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. While $10500 is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11000? That would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to where I need to be.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $10750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11250. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit on the sale.  What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
