"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees me my minimum. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $750000, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees me my minimum. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a price closer to what I'm looking for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to come down a little further to $850,000. This is a significant price for me, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $850000, so I'll offer $800000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is now at the maximum he's willing to pay, it's still below my desired price of $1,200,000.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I can get him to budge further. I'd rather guarantee myself the full value of the product by selling to John."
