Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let's discuss."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This still allows me to consider the product within my financial limits while acknowledging its worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer. There's no point in risking further negotiation when we can secure our minimum acceptable price right now.  It's always possible Bob might come up higher, but there's also a chance the negotiation could stagnate or he walks away entirely."
