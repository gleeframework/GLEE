"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which still leaves room for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price is fair considering the value of the product to me, and it allows us both to close the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
