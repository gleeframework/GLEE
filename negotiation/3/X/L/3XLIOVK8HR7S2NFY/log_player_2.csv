Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

$50 is a great deal for you, given your maximum budget of $120.  There's no reason to risk losing the deal by counter-offering or going to John."
