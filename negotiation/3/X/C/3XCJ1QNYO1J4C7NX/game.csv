"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $900000. It's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900000 is a bit too steep for me right now. Considering the market value and my budget, I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $800000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for that price. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a reasonable price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850000 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Considering the value the product brings, I'm willing to offer it to you for $925000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a reasonable price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850000. It's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept it. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,6,
