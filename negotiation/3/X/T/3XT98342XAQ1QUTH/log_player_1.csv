Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and potential price sensitivity.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting point allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. This increases the chance of settling on a price significantly higher than your minimum. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, the language (""exclusive opportunity,"" ""significant value,"" ""unique nature"") hints at the product's desirability and potential for a premium price."
