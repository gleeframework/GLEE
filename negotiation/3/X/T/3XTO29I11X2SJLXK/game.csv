,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is your target price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'll need to add a little extra to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $87? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",87.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",82.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a serious commitment to buy the product, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go down to $82 just yet. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my original price. How about we meet at $84? It's a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",84.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $84. How about we meet at $83? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",83.0,Bob,6,
