"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to someone else for a bit more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. Rejecting this offer might push Alice to lower her price, or you can stick with your backup plan and buy from John."
