Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $175. This is higher than Bob's valuation of $100, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic, aiming to build a good rapport. 
* **Strategy:** I'm starting high to maximize my potential profit. I'm also making it clear that I'm not desperate to sell and have other options (selling to John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only pay up to $150. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $150 is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, as it meets my own valuation. 
* **Selling to John:** While I could sell to John for the same price, there's no additional benefit in doing so.  
* **Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a lower price or a prolonged process. It's not worth the risk for a potential gain of $0. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical and efficient choice in this scenario."
