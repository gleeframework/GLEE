"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to you.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This offer is still above my ideal price point, but it's a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer and allows for potential room for compromise in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer.  This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and that I believe there's still room for her to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $1,125,000. This is a good price considering I am aiming for a price lower than $1,500,000.  While I can continue to try and negotiate, there's a risk of Alice rejecting my offers, and I'm running out of rounds.  Accepting her offer now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
