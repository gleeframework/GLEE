Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also setting a firm lower limit ($1,000,000 from John).

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's acceptable. 
* If Bob's offer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer. 
* If the negotiations stall, or Bob's offers become unreasonable, I'll move on to John to secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There's room to negotiate further, and Bob acknowledges the product's worth.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum price. I need to find a price that is appealing to Bob while still allowing me to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still gives you a good deal considering your value for the product. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm continuing to emphasize a win-win situation, emphasizing that this price still offers a good deal for Bob.
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintaining a firm stance on my minimum acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiations or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Further negotiation unlikely to yield much more:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher price, but it's unlikely to be significantly more than $825,000. 
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the greater the risk that John could withdraw his offer or another buyer could emerge.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and conclude the negotiation."
