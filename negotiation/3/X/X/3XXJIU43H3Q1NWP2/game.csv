"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
