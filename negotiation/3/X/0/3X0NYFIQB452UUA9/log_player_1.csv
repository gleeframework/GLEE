Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth $1,200,000 to me, and I'm sure it'll be a great asset to you. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the value of the product to Bob, reinforcing his interest in acquiring it. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm keeping the tone positive and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've made a profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll wait for his counteroffer and assess if it's worth pursuing further negotiations or if it's better to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I am willing to pay $1300000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is slightly better than my minimum acceptable price:** While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can potentially do better.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  There's still room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've increased Bob's offer by $50,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, justifying my counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and open tone to encourage further negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a better price than selling to John.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1325000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $1,350,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I could try to negotiate a bit higher, the risk of Bob walking away and me having to sell to John for less is too high. 
* **Time and effort:** Further negotiation might take more time and effort without a guarantee of a significantly better outcome.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice. It secures a sale at a price that is slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal completely."
