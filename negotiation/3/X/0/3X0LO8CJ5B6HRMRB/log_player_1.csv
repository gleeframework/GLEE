Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I think you'll find it's worth the value!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations above your minimum price. This gives you room to negotiate if needed.
* **Leave Room for Counteroffer:**  By offering it at $100, there's a chance Bob might counter with a lower price (e.g., $90), which would still be a good profit for you.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response to this initial offer will give you a better idea of how much he might be willing to pay. 

**Important:**  Remember, if Bob rejects this offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John. So, don't feel pressured to go below that price."
