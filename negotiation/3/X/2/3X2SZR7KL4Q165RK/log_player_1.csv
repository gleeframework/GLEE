Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $120.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $10) while allowing you to make a significant profit above your minimum. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, as a higher price risks him rejecting the offer, leading you to sell it for less to John."
