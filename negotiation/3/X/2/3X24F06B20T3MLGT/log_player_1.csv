Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this revised offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $700,000 is a significant sum, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's offer is getting closer to his perceived value ($800,000) but is still far from our minimum ($1,000,000). We need to signal that we're willing to negotiate but not desperate.  There's room to inch closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive price for a product of this caliber."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This is a strong offer, and I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure and is willing to move closer to his perceived value.  However, $750,000 is still a significant loss for us.  We need to hold firm, show we're serious about our minimum, and see if he's willing to bridge the gap further.  There's a risk he'll walk, but the potential reward of a higher price remains."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  If you meet me in the middle at $800,000, we have a deal.  This is my best and final offer."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This strategy aims to achieve the following:

* **Finality:** By stating this is our ""best and final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and seriousness. 
* **Fairness:** Meeting in the middle at $800,000 might appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and compromise. 
* **Profit Maximization:**  We're still securing a significant profit over John's guaranteed offer while acknowledging the negotiation's back-and-forth nature.

This approach carries some risk as Bob could walk away. However, it positions us for the best possible outcome at this stage of the negotiation."
