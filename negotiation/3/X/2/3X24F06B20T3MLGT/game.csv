"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this revised offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
