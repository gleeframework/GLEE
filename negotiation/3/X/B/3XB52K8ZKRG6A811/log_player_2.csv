You have three options:

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. Bob can get the product for cheaper from John, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it still leaves you a decent margin. Let's meet halfway! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob's goal is to get the product for the lowest price possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  John offers the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at this point."
