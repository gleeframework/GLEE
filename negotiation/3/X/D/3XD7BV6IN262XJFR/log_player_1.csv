Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $1,250,000. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
