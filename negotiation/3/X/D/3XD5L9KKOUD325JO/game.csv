"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product provides exceptional value, and I believe a price of $18,000 is fair. It reflects the true worth of what you're getting.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $15,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,4,

"You're right, Bob, $15,000 is a fair starting point. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at that price.  However, I'd rather work with you. Would you be willing to do $16,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, and I'm glad you're willing to work with me. However, $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $14,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,6,
