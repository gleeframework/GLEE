Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. I'm asking for $850,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to start with a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly inflated price of $850,000 gives Bob the impression there might be wiggle room for negotiation if he's interested. 
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:**  The message highlights the product's value specifically for Bob, aiming to pique his interest and justify the higher price.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still offering Bob a fair chance to consider the purchase."
