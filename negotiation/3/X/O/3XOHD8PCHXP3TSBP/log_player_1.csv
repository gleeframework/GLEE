{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering it's worth more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $12,000, and $14,000 is a decent starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room to negotiate higher if he's willing. 
* **It's a fair offer:**  It shows you're open to negotiation but also value the product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
