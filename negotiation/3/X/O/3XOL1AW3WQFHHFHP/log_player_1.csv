Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high but reasonable price:** Starting at $1,400,000 allows room for negotiation while staying significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" motivates Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.
* **Not revealing the absolute bottom line:**  While we know John will buy for $1,500,000, it's best to keep that information confidential in case negotiations with Bob become protracted."
