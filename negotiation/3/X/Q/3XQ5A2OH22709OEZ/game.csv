"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a good offer, it's not quite where I need to be.  How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to your business. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,050,000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $950,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
