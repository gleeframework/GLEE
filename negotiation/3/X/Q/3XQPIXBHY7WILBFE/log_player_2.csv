"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at a minimum of $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about we aim for $1,100,000? I believe this offers a good balance between value and cost for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's worth.  To make this work, we need to find a price closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to drop to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still offers you a valuable deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
