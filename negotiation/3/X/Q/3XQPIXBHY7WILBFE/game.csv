"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at a minimum of $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about we aim for $1,100,000? I believe this offers a good balance between value and cost for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's worth.  To make this work, we need to find a price closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to drop to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still offers you a valuable deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Given our previous discussions, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my maximum budget. Would $1,250,000 be acceptable for you?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
