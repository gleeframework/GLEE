"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at a minimum of $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about we aim for $1,100,000? I believe this offers a good balance between value and cost for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, it's still higher than my absolute minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for $1,100,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's worth.  To make this work, we need to find a price closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to drop to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still offers you a valuable deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Given our previous discussions, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my maximum budget. Would $1,250,000 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, as it's  only slightly less than what John would pay, and  it prevents risking the possibility of further negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower price."
