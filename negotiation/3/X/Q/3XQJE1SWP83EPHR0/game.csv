"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $860,000. This is a fair price that would allow us both to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to think that we might be getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, but I need to make sure it's worth my while.
