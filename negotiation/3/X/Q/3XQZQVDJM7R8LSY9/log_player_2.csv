Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer a lower price, I don't want to risk losing the product and being forced to buy from John for a higher price. This is a good compromise, and it's likely I won't get a significantly better offer."
