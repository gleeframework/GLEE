Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. I've set the price at $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $950,000 is ambitious, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, should he want to negotiate.
* **High but Justifiable:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John provides a safety net ($800,000), allowing Alice to aim higher with Bob."
