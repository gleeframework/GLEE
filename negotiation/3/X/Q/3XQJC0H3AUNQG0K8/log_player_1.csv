Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit with Bob:** Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000,  any price below this will be readily accepted. However, aiming for the highest possible price within Bob's potential acceptance range maximizes profit. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 provides a safety net.  There's no need to go below this price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,350,000 is a starting point. It's significantly lower than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob. However, it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, the product goes to John automatically. There's no opportunity for a counter-offer in this scenario."
