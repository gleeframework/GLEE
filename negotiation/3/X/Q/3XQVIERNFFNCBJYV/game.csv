"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know your thoughts.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. How about $13,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $14,250? This price is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",14250.0,Alice,5,
