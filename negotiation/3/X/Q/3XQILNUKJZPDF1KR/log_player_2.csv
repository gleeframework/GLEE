"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. I believe this is a great opportunity for both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's first offer is a good sign, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to secure a significant discount while still leaving room for further negotiation if Alice isn't immediately on board."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. How about $85 for the product? This is my best offer considering its value and the current market conditions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving from $95 to $85.  However, there's still a chance to meet closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 82.50
}
```

This counter-offer splits the difference while still nudging the price closer to my ideal range. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a good deal."
