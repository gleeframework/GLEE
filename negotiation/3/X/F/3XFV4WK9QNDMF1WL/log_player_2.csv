Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really sold on the product, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice seems firm on her price and is unlikely to go much lower than $1,025,000. Accepting this offer saves us $175,000 compared to John's price.  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and risks ending up with a worse deal if we push too hard."
