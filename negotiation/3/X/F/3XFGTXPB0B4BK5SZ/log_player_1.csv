Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my target price. $9,000 is too low, but I'll see if I can negotiate something better in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,250 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Could you do $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$9,500 is still below my minimum, but I'm going to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  How about we compromise at $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
