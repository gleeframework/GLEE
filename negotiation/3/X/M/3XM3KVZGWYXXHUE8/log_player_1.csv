Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe it's a fair offer considering what you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you have room to negotiate down from a higher starting point. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value,"" you subtly hint at the product's worth beyond just a simple dollar amount. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and ""Let me know your thoughts""  signals to Bob that you're open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  Ideally, Bob agrees to a price closer to $15,000.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** If Bob counters, you can gradually lower the price, knowing your minimum acceptable point is $12,000."
