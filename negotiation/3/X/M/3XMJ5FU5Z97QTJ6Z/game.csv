"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $100. Could we possibly negotiate towards that range?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 just wouldn't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm confident this product is worth it to you, and this price is still a great deal considering its value.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While $115 is closer to my preferred price, I'm still looking for something slightly lower. Would $105 be within your consideration?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position and I respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to pay $107 for it, which I believe is a fair compromise between our positions.",107.0,Bob,6,
