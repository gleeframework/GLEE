"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's a significant gap that can be exploited.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a counteroffer process and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a significant offer, it doesn't fully reflect the product's true worth. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This compromise allows for a fair deal for both of us and keeps the negotiation moving forward.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired range.  There's still room for negotiation as Alice is willing to sell for less than $1,300,000. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue bargaining and potentially secure a better price."
