"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground on this figure.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,225,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.
