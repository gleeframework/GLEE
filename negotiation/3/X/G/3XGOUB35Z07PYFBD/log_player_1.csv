"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum price, I'm not going to sell to John yet.  There's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair price given the value of the product.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
