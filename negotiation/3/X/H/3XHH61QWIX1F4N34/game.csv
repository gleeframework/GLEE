"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1000000 is a good starting point, I'm still confident this product offers significant value for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This reflects a considerable discount from my initial offer and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
