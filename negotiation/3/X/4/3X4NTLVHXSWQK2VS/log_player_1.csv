Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

Bob is clearly anchored at $120, which is the same amount John is offering.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better offer from Bob.  It's time to cut losses and sell to John."
