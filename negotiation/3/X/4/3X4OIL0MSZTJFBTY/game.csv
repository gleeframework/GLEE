"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with this sale.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
