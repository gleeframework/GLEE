You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for less than $100, so you'll save more money by continuing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer of $95. This is a good deal, and you'll save $25 compared to buying from John.  While you might be able to get it for less with further negotiation, there's no guarantee you'll be able to get it cheaper and you'll also be risking the chance of losing the deal entirely."
