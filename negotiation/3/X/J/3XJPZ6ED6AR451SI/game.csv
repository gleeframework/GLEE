"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, Alice. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify $14,500.  Would you consider $13,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $13,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",13750.0,Alice,5,
