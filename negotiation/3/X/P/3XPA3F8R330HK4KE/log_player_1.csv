"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $8,000 to you, right? Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Framing the deal:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob, highlighting the potential gain for him.
* **Room for negotiation:** This price allows for a few rounds of counteroffers before I might need to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I believe I can potentially get more by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:**  I'm raising my offer slightly, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintain my minimum:** I'm keeping my offer above my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Framing the deal:**  I'm framing this offer as a fair compromise,  emphasizing that we're getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can we try that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob is getting closer to my target, there's still room for further negotiation.  
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get out of this product.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:** I'm lowering my offer again, showing flexibility.
* **Maintaining my value:**  $10,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, ensuring a good profit for me.
* **Finality:** I'm framing this as a final offer, hoping to close the deal quickly.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $10,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the limit:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting very close to my minimum of $15,000. There's not much room for further negotiation.
* **Risk of getting stuck:**  If I continue to negotiate, I risk that Bob will reject my offers and I'll be left with a deal below my desired minimum. 
* **Time is running out:** We're already at round 6 out of 10.  Selling to John now guarantees a much higher profit and avoids any further risk. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
