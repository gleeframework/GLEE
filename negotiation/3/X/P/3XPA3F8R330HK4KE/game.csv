"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $8,000 to you, right? Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can we try that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get out of this product.  Let's finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $10,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
