,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $8,000 is significantly below its true worth. I could consider $13,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $13,000 is still above my budget. I could go up to $9,500. That's a fair offer, considering I can get it for $10,000 elsewhere.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,500 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. I appreciate you coming down, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make my final offer at $10,000. That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price given the market.  Let me know your decision.",10000.0,Bob,6,
