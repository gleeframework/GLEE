"I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't accept $1,200,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
