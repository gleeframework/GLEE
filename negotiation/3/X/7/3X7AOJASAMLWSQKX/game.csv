"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the potential in this product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a significant departure from its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.",825000.0,Bob,4,
