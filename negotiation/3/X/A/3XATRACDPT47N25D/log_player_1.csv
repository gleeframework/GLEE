Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he can haggle you down a bit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly anchor Bob's mind to a higher price point.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product at a price he might find reasonable. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
