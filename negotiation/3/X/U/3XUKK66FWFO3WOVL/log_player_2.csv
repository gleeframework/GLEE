"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
It's the first round and Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  We should make a counteroffer significantly lower to try and close the deal for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This still gives you a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from a price I'd consider accepting. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, so let's see if we can get her closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11250}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $11,750?  That's a fair price that recognizes both of our needs. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're getting close, but every dollar counts!  It's worth one more counter-offer to see if Alice will come down a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're really close!  I'm willing to offer $11,500 to finalize the deal. That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
