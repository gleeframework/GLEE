**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* It's worth attempting to negotiate further as there's a significant gap between our desired prices.
* Rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
