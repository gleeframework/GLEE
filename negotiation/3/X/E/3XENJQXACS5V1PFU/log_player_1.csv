Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,225,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price allows for a fair return for you while staying within my financial constraints.  I hope we can reach an agreement.
