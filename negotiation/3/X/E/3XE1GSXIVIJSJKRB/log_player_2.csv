(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If that fails, you have the option to buy from John for your maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer sets the price at your maximum budget. It's a strong starting point, but still leaves room for potential negotiation if Alice wants to make a counter-counteroffer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price. You still have the option to buy from John if you don't reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a price slightly higher than my initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go much higher.  This approach could encourage Alice to make a counteroffer closer to my preferred price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my budget.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to my target, or even reach a deal where both of us are happy.  If I don't get a price that works, I can still fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,200,000. This is still below Alice's current offer, but it's getting closer to her likely minimum acceptable price, as she values the product at $1,200,000.  This could potentially lead to a quick agreement."
