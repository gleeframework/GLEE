Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While a simple ""take it or leave it"" approach could work, providing some context about the product's value might make Bob more receptive to the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone suggests Alice is open to discussing the price, leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer.

By starting high, Alice maximizes her chances of getting a price closer to her desired outcome while still having John as a backup to ensure she doesn't lose out on the minimum value."
