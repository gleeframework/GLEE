``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range.  I'll be prepared to negotiate from here, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is too low for me. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'd like to get.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with another counteroffer."

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise â€“ I'm coming down from my initial $11,000, but it's still above Bob's $9,500 offer. I think this is a fair price considering what the product is worth to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit closer to my goal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $10,250. I'm making a smaller concession this time, hoping to demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. It's not worth risking a further rejection.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirements."
