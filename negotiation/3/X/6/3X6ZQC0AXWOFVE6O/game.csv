"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While it's tempting, I'm looking to save a bit more. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
