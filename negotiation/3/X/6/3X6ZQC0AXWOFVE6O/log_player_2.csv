"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While it's tempting, I'm looking to save a bit more. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's still below his maximum budget of $15,000, and it saves him $4,000 compared to buying from John.  There's always the chance he could negotiate lower, but it's risky given Alice might walk away, and the price from John is a fixed point of reference."
