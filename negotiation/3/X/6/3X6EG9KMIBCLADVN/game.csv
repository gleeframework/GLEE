"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! I'm interested in making a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to come down to that price.  How about we meet halfway between our last offers?  $1,100,000 reflects the value I place on the product and gives you a good deal as well.  Let's see if we can agree on this and finalize the sale.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
