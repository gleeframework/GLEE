"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $140. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
```
Reason:While $140 is close to my limit, there's room for negotiation. Starting lower might allow me to secure a better deal.
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

Reason: I'm starting with a price slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product ($120). This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below my $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

```
Reason:  Alice is meeting me in the middle, and $125 is a reasonable price. It's closer to her value, but still a good deal for me, saving $25 off my maximum.
