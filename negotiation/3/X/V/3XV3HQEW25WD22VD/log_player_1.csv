Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,450,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can go down to $1,350,000. This offer represents a substantial discount while acknowledging the product's worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches what John is willing to pay. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds and ensures a profit."
