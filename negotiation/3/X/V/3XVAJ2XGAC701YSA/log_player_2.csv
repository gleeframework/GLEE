It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you know Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,000,000.  A counteroffer gives you a chance to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm open to finding a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice has come down to your maximum price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as you're getting the best possible deal at this point."
