"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. Therefore, it's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to buy the product for as low as possible.  He starts with a significant counteroffer of $12,000, which is $8,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This aggressive counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation and aims to get Alice closer to Bob's target price of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his maximum value of $15,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further. There's a chance that she may be willing to negotiate to a price Bob is comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. By offering $14,000, he's showing Alice he's serious about buying but still within his budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise and increases the likelihood of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $15,000. While it's getting closer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has 5 rounds left and should try to get Alice closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his maximum price point of $15,000.  He's made it clear he's willing to buy at this price. If Alice rejects this offer, he can always buy from John for the same price. It's a win-win situation for Bob."
