Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product from you if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than what John is offering, and it's getting closer to my desired price. I'm going to accept it and close the deal."
