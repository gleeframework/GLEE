Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,200,000. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

 I'm not going to accept Bob's offer, because it's too low.  I can get $1,500,000 from John, so I need to push Bob higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still too far apart from where we need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you can see the value in this deal.  Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1,700,000. My maximum budget remains at $1,200,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is being stubborn and refuses to budge.  I've already lowered my price significantly.  Rather than risk getting stuck with a low price, I'm going to sell to John.  It's a sure thing and I'm confident I'll get my desired price."
