"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to negotiate for a lower price, accepting the $140 offer from Alice is the best choice. Here's why:

* **Saves Money:** You save $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Within Budget:**  The price is within your $150 limit. 
* **Avoids Uncertainty:**  Rejecting the offer means risking no deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price."
