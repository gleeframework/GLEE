Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum selling price. This leaves room for you to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The high price will help you understand how interested Bob is. If he outright rejects it, you know he's very price-sensitive. 
* **Leave Room:** By starting at $160, you have a buffer to potentially go down to $140 or even $130 and still make a profit beyond your $120 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum. You have room to negotiate and try to meet somewhere in the middle. John's offer provides a safety net, but it's worth exploring if you can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming back with a price. I could come down a bit, how about $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You're acknowledging Bob's offer and showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Counter:**  You're moving closer to Bob's offer but staying significantly above his suggested price and still comfortably above your minimum.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number, you're framing it as a concession (""come down a bit"")."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $110 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and $110 is a reasonable compromise. It's above your minimum selling price, and further negotiation might risk losing the sale altogether.  Taking the profit of $30 now is a better outcome than potentially holding out for another $10 and risking no deal."
