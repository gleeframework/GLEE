"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the negotiation. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and I pay $10,500? I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to get the price I want. How about I include a complimentary service that's worth $1,000, and we meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
