"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too low for me.  It's a valuable product and I believe it's worth more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again. While I'm getting closer to $1,000,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Let's finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
