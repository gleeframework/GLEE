"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This reflects the product's high quality and potential.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  which still reflects the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is still a bit too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise and go down to $820,000. This is my final offer, considering the product's true worth. Let's close this deal.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate that you're trying to find a middle ground here.  $820,000 is still a touch high for me. How about we settle at $780,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and  I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,6,
