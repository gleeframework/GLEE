"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but below my minimum acceptable value ($120). This gives room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good profit.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** The price is not too extreme, so it's likely Bob will counteroffer, allowing for more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $100. Could we possibly negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While $100 is too low, I still believe there's room to negotiate with Bob, potentially getting a price closer to my desired range.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $120 is a good option, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob.  

I will proceed to round 3 and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about $110? That's still a great price, and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $115 to $110. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the price as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the value he'll get.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's a more realistic compromise point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. Considering my budget, could we possibly meet in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While $105 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I believe there's still potential to get a better price.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement closer to my target.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $120 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob, hoping to secure a higher price.

I will proceed to round 5 and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $105 is closer, I'm still a little ways off from my target.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $112.50?  That way, we can both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 112.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($105). This shows that I'm taking his counteroffer seriously and am ready to find common ground.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair split,"" which makes it more appealing to Bob.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $112.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's a significant concession that shows my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $110, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:** Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise, considering his initial offer of $100 and my counteroffers. 
* **Meeting my Target:** While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time Factor:**  We're already in round 6, and it's getting closer to the end of the negotiation window. Continuing to negotiate risks losing a sale altogether.

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $110."
