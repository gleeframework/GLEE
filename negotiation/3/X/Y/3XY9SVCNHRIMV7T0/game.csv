"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand your price point, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $102.50 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $95. Would that work for you?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal.  $95 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we settle on $98?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally finalize this.",98.0,Alice,5,
