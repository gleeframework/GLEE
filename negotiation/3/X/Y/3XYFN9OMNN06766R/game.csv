"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It holds significant value, and I believe it can be of great benefit to you. My asking price is $1400000. This price reflects the product's high quality and potential. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $1250000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. While I value our potential partnership, $1250000 doesn't quite cover the true worth of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offering. How about $1350000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
