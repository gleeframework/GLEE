"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider parting with it for $1,350,000.  This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  While I recognize its value, I need a price that makes sense for me. Would you consider $950,000? That's a significant investment on my part.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,175,000?  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to move on price is appreciated. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could potentially stretch to $1,050,000.  This is a strong offer, and I think it's fair for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close this deal -  $1,125,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
