Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $7,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $7,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping for something a little higher. How about we meet at $8,250?  It's a fair compromise, and allows us both to get a decent deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

``` 

We're still in a position to negotiate a better price than John's offer. Alice is clearly willing to come down, and we have time on our hands."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we make this our final offer - $8,000.  That's my bottom line, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching our limit:**  We're now matching John's price. We don't want to go any higher.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we're adding some pressure and signaling we're serious. 
* **Fairness:**  We're still offering a price that's a significant gain for Alice compared to not making a sale."
