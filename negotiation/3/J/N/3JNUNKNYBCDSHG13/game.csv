,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and it would still allow you to get a great deal on the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion, but I really need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
