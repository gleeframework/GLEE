Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we want to maximize our profit. Offering it slightly below his perceived value increases the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant gain for you.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net. This knowledge allows us to confidently aim higher with Bob."
