"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $15,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,500 is closer to his budget, he can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice or buying from John.  He still has several rounds left to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering we are both trying to meet in the middle.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
