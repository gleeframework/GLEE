**Reasoning:**

Bob has been extremely consistent in his valuation of the product at $1,200,000.  While a deal at $1,350,000 or even $1,275,000 would be ideal, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to budge. Accepting his offer of $1,200,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
