"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and allows you to acquire a product that will undoubtedly bring great benefit to your business. Let's find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree it's a valuable product, $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $750,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
