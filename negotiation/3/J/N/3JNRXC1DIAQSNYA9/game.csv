"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your effort to meet halfway, and I appreciate that. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $10,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit further, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'm offering $9,750. I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",9750.0,Bob,6,
