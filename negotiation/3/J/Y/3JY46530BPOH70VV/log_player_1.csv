Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're eager to buy, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you value the product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $11,000, which is closer to my desired price of $12,000.  It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.  I'm confident I can get a better price with John if this doesn't work out."
