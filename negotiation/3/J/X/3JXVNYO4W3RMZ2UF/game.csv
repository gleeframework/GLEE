"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a starting point for us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I see in the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this still represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,100,000? I'm confident this product can be very beneficial for both of us if we can find a price that works for both sides.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
