"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. 

It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not taking a major risk with this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,500. This is a reasonable compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject and try to push for a bit more. I'm still confident I can get closer to $15,000, and I have the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,500. This is only $500 above Bob's offer, and it's a significant step closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate and potentially get a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee that will happen, and I risk losing the deal entirely. It's best to accept Bob's offer now and secure a sale."
