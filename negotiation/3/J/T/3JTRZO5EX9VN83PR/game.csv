"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I see you're serious, and I appreciate that.  While $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to find a middle ground. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we settle on $1,300,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
