Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800000.  This is my absolute maximum, given the value I place on it. Let me know if you're willing to work with me at this price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800000.  If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to look at other options.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,4,
