"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $650,000 is a good starting point, but there's significant room for negotiation.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives Bob the opportunity to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $400,000 is a bold move, likely to be rejected, but it sets the stage for negotiation and establishes Bob's willingness to push for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $550,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still quite high.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives Bob a chance to further negotiate and potentially secure a lower price.  He still has plenty of rounds to reach a deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  $450,000 is a reasonable middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's most recent offer, making it more likely to be accepted.  This also keeps him within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $500,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a lower price. He still has time before having to resort to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 475000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is again increasing his offer, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement.  $475,000 is a slight increase from his previous offer, showing flexibility while still staying within his desired price range. This offer also allows him to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $490,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $490,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $490,000 is getting very close to Bob's desired price range, and with only three rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice increases.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a relatively favorable price, leaving some room for profit while avoiding the higher cost of John's offer."
