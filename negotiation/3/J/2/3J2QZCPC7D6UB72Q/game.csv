"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I know it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's mutually beneficial.  I'm asking for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a product that will drive substantial value for your company. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
