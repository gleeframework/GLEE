Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your true value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you make a significant profit. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""offering it to you first,"" you imply scarcity and encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to get the highest price possible from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
