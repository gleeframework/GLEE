"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you think?",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $88 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $90. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
