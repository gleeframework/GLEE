Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so a price of $100 is still within a reasonable range for him to consider.
* **It's below your minimum:** You want to get at least $120, so you have room to negotiate.
* **It shows you're flexible:**  By starting with a price lower than your minimum, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate, which might make Bob more open to accepting a deal. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum price of $120 and even lower than your initial offer.  There's still room for negotiation with Bob, and you can potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a good move for the following reasons:

* **It's a compromise:**  You're meeting Bob halfway, which shows you're willing to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $92.50 is still higher than your minimum price of $120, giving you some wiggle room if Bob wants to bargain further.
* **It keeps the conversation open:**  By offering a counteroffer, you demonstrate your commitment to the negotiation and keep the possibility of a deal alive. 

Let's see if Bob's interested in splitting the difference!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $88 is closer to your minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still quite a bit below what you'd like to get.  It's worth seeing if you can push for a slightly higher price, especially since John is willing to pay $120. You can still negotiate with Bob, but you might want to start thinking about how much time you want to invest in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $88 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $90. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **It's a small compromise:** You're only asking for $2 more than Bob's last offer, showing that you're serious about making a deal but also value the product.
* **It's closer to your minimum:**  $90 is still a significant improvement over $88 and gets you closer to your minimum of $120.
* **It sets a clear boundary:** By stating that you can't go lower than $90, you're giving Bob a firm price point to work with.

It's a risk, as Bob could walk away, but it's a better position than accepting $88.  Let's see if he's willing to meet you at $90!"
