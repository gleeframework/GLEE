"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Could you do $16,000?  That's a significant price reduction to bridge the gap.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,000 is low, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
