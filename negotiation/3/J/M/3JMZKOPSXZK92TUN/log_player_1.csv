Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a price of $950,000 anchors the negotiation high. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the price is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes value and confidence, increasing the perceived worth of the product."
