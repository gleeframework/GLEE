"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and features.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob, and for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective on the value, $12,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  Would you be willing to consider $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. Can you consider this price?",14500.0,Bob,4,
