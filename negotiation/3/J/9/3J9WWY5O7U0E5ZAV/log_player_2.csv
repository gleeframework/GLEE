# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial returns.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no incentive to accept it immediately. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can then gauge how much Alice is willing to compromise and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm prepared to come down to $900000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,000,000 to $900,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price of $750,000."
