"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see potential in the product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750000.  Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm prepared to come down to $900000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $825000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing both of us to come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
