"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, this price is attractive but not immediately ""give-away"" level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $12,000 is better than selling to John, but I can still do better. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a smaller difference than my previous counteroffer, showing that I'm becoming more flexible but still holding firm on getting a good price."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,500. We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still hoping to maximize my profit.  This offer shows I'm flexible, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price.  While $10,500 is not my ideal, it's still a better outcome than selling to John for $10,000.  It's important to remember that sometimes it's better to settle for a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal completely."
