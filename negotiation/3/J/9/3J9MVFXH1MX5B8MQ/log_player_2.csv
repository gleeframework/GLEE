Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We understand your budget constraints and are willing to accommodate them. Our revised offer for the product is $725,000. We believe this still represents a fair value for the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and me having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
