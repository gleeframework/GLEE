,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer of $120. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Can we do that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $130. I'm willing to come down to $135, which is a great compromise. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,

"I like where this is going, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $132.50, but I'm still going to hold out for a bit more. I'll come down to $133.50. That's my final offer. What do you think?",133.5,Alice,7,

"I'm not comfortable going above $132.50, so I'll stick with my previous offer. Can you meet me at $132.50?",132.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up on getting a good price for the product. I'll meet you at $132.50, but I want to throw in an additional bonus feature that's worth $5. That way, you'll get an even better deal. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus feature, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make a final offer of $130. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",130.0,Bob,10,
