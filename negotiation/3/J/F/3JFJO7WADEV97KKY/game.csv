"Hey Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but $175 is outside my budget.  How about $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",150.0,Alice,3,
