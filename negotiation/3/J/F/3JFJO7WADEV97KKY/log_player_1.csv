{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a starting point. Since I know the product is worth $100 to Bob, I'm aiming a bit higher than that, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  I don't want to start too high and risk him immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but $175 is outside my budget.  How about $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 150}
