Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,110,000. I'm willing to give you a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. How about we meet at $1,115,000?

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $1,100,000.  At this point, the difference between her offer and your last counter is only $5,000. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate could risk the deal.  Taking the $1,115,000 is a good compromise."
