"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120. 
* Alice's offer of $100 is higher than her minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* This means there's room for negotiation to get a better price. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering $90, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $100.
* This price is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $80, making it a reasonable offer for both parties.
* This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to accept a price that is still profitable for her while also saving me money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $95 is still within my acceptable range of $120.
* While I'd prefer a lower price, further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Alice refusing to budge.
* Accepting the offer allows me to purchase the product while still saving $25 compared to buying from John."
