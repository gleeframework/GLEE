Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a fair price that is more than what the product is worth to Bob, but also less than what I'd get from John. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob rather than going to John,  $7,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's closer to a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's still below what I'd like to get, but it's a lot closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of Bob continuing to lower his offer or of having to sell to John."
