You can do better than $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can get a lower price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,350,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you placed on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

$1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to try to get Alice down a little further before I consider buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,325,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but that's as high as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000

Alice has come down significantly. Accepting this offer gets me the product at a good price, saving me a substantial amount compared to John's price."
