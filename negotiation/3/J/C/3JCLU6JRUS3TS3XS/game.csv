"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer for $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows you to make a profit. Let's close the deal at this price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to the price you're looking for, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $13,250, which is still a good profit for me. However, I'm also keeping the option open to sell to John at $12,000, so I need to be careful not to go too low. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
