Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $14,000.  This is a good opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target of $12,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows you to make a profit. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to the price you're looking for, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $13,250, which is still a good profit for me. However, I'm also keeping the option open to sell to John at $12,000, so I need to be careful not to go too low. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  The price Alice is offering ($13,250) is still higher than Bob's target of $12,000.  There's a chance he could negotiate a lower price with Alice, but it's not guaranteed. Buying from John at $12,000 guarantees that Bob gets the product at his target price."
