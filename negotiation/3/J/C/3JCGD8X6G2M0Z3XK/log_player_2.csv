Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $775,000. This is my best compromise, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
