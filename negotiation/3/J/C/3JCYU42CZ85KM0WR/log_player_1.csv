"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I won't sell for less than $800,000, as that's my floor.
* **Bob's maximum:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **First offer strategy:** Starting with a high offer shows confidence and leaves room for compromise. I'm aiming for a good chunk of the potential profit while leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** $900,000 is closer to my minimum, but I can still do better. 
* **Potential for more:** There's a significant gap between his offer and the value to him, indicating he's still willing to pay more. 
* **Strategy:**  I'll counter with a higher offer, aiming for a more equitable split of the potential profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My last offer was $1,100,000, and Bob countered at $900,000.  This counteroffer meets halfway, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,000,000 is still significantly above my minimum ($800,000) and leaves Bob with a good deal since he values it at $1,200,000. 
* **Momentum:** This counteroffer puts the ball back in Bob's court and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the middle:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my previous offer of $1,000,000. This suggests we are nearing a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time is money:**  We've already gone through a few rounds, and with each round, the chance of selling to John at $800,000 becomes more tempting.
* **Acceptable profit:** While I'd prefer a higher price, $950,000 is a significant gain and a good outcome considering my minimum. 

It's important to weigh the potential for a slightly higher price against the risk of losing the deal and accepting John's offer."
