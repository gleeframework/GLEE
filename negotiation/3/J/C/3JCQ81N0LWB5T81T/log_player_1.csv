Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point. Since the product is worth exactly $1,000,000 to Bob, it's in his best interest to accept. However, this assumes a few things:

* **No other information about Bob:**  We don't know his financial situation or how much he *wants* the product. He might be willing to pay more.
* **Negotiation style:** This offer is direct and doesn't leave much room for bargaining.  A more nuanced approach might yield a better outcome. 

Here are some alternative strategies to consider:

* **Starting high:**  You could start with a price of $1,200,000 or $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Asking questions:**  Before making an offer, you could ask Bob about his budget or what he finds valuable about the product. This information could help you tailor your offer. 
* **Focus on value:**  Instead of just stating a price, you could emphasize the benefits of the product and how it can be valuable to Bob.

Remember, the goal is to get the highest price possible while also considering the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can come to an agreement that respects both our interests. How about we discuss a price closer to $800,000? I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than the product's value to both of us. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.  It's better to try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would be a fair compromise and allows us both to achieve a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the middle:**  Offering $900,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  Highlighting the shared value of the product emphasizes that a deal is possible if we both agree on a fair price.
* **Keep the door open:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward without being too aggressive.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:** Bob may accept this offer, counteroffer again, or decide to walk away. 
* **Prepare for a potential final offer:**  If Bob counters again, I might have to decide whether to accept or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. I've given it some thought and while I understand your position, I still feel that $800,000 would be a more reasonable price for both of us. It's significantly less than your original offer and closer to what I suggested earlier. I hope this helps move us towards a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has shown a stubbornness to budge from his $800,000 offer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with him is unlikely to lead to a significantly better price.  Selling the product to John for $1,000,000 guarantees the maximum value for me, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potential lower offers from Bob."
