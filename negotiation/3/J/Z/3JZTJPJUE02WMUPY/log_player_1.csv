Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,500,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,500,000 is still a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I get the money sooner rather than later. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could become unproductive and potentially damage the relationship with Bob.

It's a good deal, and time to seal the agreement!"
