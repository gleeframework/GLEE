"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still ensuring I profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and optimistic to create a positive tone for the negotiation. 

I'm hoping Bob will either accept this offer or counter with a price closer to my desired range. If he rejects, I'll adjust my next offer based on his response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price.  I still have 8 rounds left and I believe I can get a better price.

**Next Move:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $11,500 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and emphasizing the desire to find a compromise.  This encourages Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:** I believe this counteroffer will push the negotiation closer to a successful conclusion. If Bob rejects, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy, but I'm still confident I can get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counteroffer at $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and with only 6 rounds left, the risk of reaching a stalemate is increasing.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I would prefer to push for a higher price, accepting this offer guarantees me a decent profit. The risk of rejecting and potentially ending up with John's offer of $15,000 is too high at this point.

**Decision:** It's strategically better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale. I can always try to get a better price in future deals."
