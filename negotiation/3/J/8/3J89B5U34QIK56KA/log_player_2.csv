# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering it to you for $950,000.

While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still above your limit. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.

While $900,000 is getting closer to your limit, you're still over it.  You have a solid backup option with John, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $925,000. This is as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

Alice is sticking to a price that's still above your limit. You've already negotiated a fair amount and it seems unlikely she'll budge further. It's time to secure the product from John at a price you're comfortable with."
