"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* Accepting $9,000 would save you $1,000, but there's a chance you can get it for less.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering $8,500, which is halfway between my maximum price ($10,000) and Alice's minimum price ($8,000). 
* This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to be flexible. 
* There's a good chance Alice will accept this offer, as it's still more than she's willing to sell for."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $9,200 is still higher than my ideal price but closer to my maximum than her previous offer. 
* I'm willing to keep negotiating since there's still potential for a better deal. 
* Rejecting allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from $8,500 to $8,750. This shows I'm still interested in buying the product but not willing to go significantly higher. 
* It's a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, potentially leading to a faster agreement.
* It also demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffers are becoming increasingly less appealing.  We are getting closer to my maximum price ($10,000) but further from my ideal price. 
* While there's still a chance we can reach an agreement, the negotiations are taking time. 
* Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget, without risking further negotiations that could lead to a higher price or a deal falling through."
