Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This allows for some room for negotiation while still securing a good profit for myself.  I'm also emphasizing the value proposition to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I can do better. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $750,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still not quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $800,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to secure the product at a fair price while ensuring I get my desired value."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on the budget for $800,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below what the product is worth to me.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum asking price, it's more beneficial to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
