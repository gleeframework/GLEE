While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum $1,000,000 limit.  Since you're still in a negotiation, it's worth trying to get a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,125,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum $1,000,000 limit.  You've already made a few counteroffers, and it's likely Alice won't go lower than this price.  At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for your maximum budget and avoid further negotiations."
