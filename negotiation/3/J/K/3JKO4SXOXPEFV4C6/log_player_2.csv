Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate how far you've come with your offer.  Frankly, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay my full asking price. However, I believe in being fair and I value our discussions. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,450,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a very fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to reach a point that's significantly better than John's offer. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price without further negotiation risk.  Alice's mention of another buyer might be a tactic, but it's not worth the gamble."
