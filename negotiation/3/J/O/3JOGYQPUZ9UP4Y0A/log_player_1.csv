Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, but I need to offer Bob a price that's enticing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, potentially getting me closer to my desired price.
* **Considering the Alternative:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed $150 from John. Therefore, any price Bob accepts above $150 is a win."
