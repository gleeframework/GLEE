{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, hoping to land somewhere in the middle.  $1,050,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum value for the product.  This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating but also willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price than Alice's offer of $1,175,000.  Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  While there's a risk of Alice walking away, Bob has the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise. However, he's still aiming for a lower price than Alice's current offer. $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise that may persuade Alice to accept, while still saving Bob money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob wants to save as much money as possible, Alice's offer of $1,190,000 is very close to his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product, rather than risk losing the opportunity altogether."
