"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product, which I believe will greatly benefit your endeavors. Considering its value to you and the market, I am offering it to you for $950,000. This is an opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a fantastic deal! Alice's offer is well below my $1,000,000 maximum and significantly less than John's offer. There's no need to negotiate further."
