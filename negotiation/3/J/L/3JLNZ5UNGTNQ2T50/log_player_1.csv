Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a significantly higher offer ($2,000,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Strong positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions it as an exclusive opportunity, aiming to increase its perceived worth in Bob's mind.
* **Backup plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still being realistic about Bob's valuation and our guaranteed alternative."
