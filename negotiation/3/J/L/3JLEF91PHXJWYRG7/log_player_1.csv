Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than your minimum value, leaving room for potential negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium for it. If not, we can then start a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still lower than my initial asking price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000.  This is a compromise from my initial price, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a more attractive price point for Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial price and my counteroffer. At this point, the negotiation seems to be going in a direction where I'm unlikely to get a price that meets my expectations.  To avoid further haggling and potential for a lower price, I will accept John's offer of $1,000,000."
