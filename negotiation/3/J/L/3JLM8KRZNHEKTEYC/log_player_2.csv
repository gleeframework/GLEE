"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and sets a lower boundary for negotiations.  It's a reasonable starting point given Bob's maximum price and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his desired target. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so it's better to keep negotiating in hopes of a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows for continued negotiation and potentially reaching a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a counteroffer that matches John's price, the alternative seller. This is a strategic move. It shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a deal but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This puts pressure on Alice to accept, as she's already at her minimum price and doesn't want to lose the sale."
