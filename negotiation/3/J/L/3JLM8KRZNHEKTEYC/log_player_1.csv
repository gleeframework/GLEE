"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a common tactic in negotiations, and I'm hoping to get a good starting point.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, which provides a safety net and gives me some leverage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I could sell to John right now for $8,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that this will be a reasonable compromise for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
