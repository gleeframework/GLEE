Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,800,000 represents a fair value considering the potential this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. I believe this price reflects a good balance between its worth and our mutual interest in reaching an agreement. What do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but Bob is steadily increasing his offer. I'm aiming to secure at least $1,600,000 and am willing to push the negotiation a bit further.  I'll still make a profit if I have to go down to $1,550,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and call it $1,575,000?  This would represent a fair compromise for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and I'm still aiming for at least $1,550,000. It's getting risky to keep pushing, but I'll hold firm for one more round to test his resolve.  If he doesn't meet my price in the next round, I'll take John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be firm on this.  I can do $1,550,000, and that's my final offer. This is a great price for a product of this caliber, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.  What do you say?"",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. This is my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm, and it's unlikely he'll go above $1,450,000.  It's time to cut my losses. Taking John's offer of $1,200,000 is the safest option at this point, guaranteeing a reasonable profit and avoiding the risk of Bob walking away."
