"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
