Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,700,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
