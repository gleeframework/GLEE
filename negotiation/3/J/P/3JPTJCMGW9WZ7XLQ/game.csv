"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it holds immense value for your business.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,700,000, a price I think is fair considering its potential. What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,700,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm open to selling for $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident this price will still be very advantageous for you.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
