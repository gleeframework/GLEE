"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose specifics without a confidentiality agreement, I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to the right buyer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial discount from its true potential value, and I believe it represents a very attractive investment. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
