Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but $60 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $120. Would you be willing to go for that price?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is a good offer, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you at $100. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and it's still significantly above your $80 fallback option with John. While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will budge much from $100, and you risk losing the guaranteed deal with John."
