"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While I'm interested, that price is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but $60 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $120. Would you be willing to go for that price?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $75? That's a fair offer, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a good offer, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you at $100. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Alice,5,
