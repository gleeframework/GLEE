"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for both of us!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $127? It's a fair price for both of us.",127.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $127. I'm willing to go up to $122, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $122?",122.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $122 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $124 for this round.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",124.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated, but I still want to make a deal. I'm willing to go up to $121, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at $121?",121.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I know we're both trying to get the best deal, but $121 isn't quite there for me.  Let's split the difference this time - I'm willing to accept $122.50. I think this is fair for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",122.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to go any higher than $121. It's the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",121.0,Bob,8,
