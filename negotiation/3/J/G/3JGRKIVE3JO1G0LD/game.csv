"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around  $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $2,000,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the potential return on investment this product offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere closer to the middle, perhaps around $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
