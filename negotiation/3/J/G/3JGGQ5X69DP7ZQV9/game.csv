"I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $1,150,000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need at least $1,250,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
