Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($15,000) as possible, maximizing potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  If Alice starts too high (e.g., $14,000), Bob might be immediately turned off, even though he values the product highly. This offer aims to strike a balance between profit and the likelihood of acceptance."
