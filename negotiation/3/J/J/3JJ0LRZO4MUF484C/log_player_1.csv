"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $15,000. Would you consider lowering the price to something closer to my maximum limit of $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough spot. Bob offered the absolute minimum, but going to John gets the same price. Let's see if we can push Bob a little further.
