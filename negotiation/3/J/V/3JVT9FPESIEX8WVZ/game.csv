"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm confident this would be a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000? It's a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal on a valuable product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
