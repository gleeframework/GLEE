"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm confident this would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000? It's a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal on a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's price of $12,000.**  This is the best price Bob has been offered so far.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation, but it's not clear Alice will go lower.**  Bob could try to counteroffer again, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and the risk is that she might walk away.

Given the current situation, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option for Bob."
