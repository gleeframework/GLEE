Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a strong fallback position, ensuring Alice doesn't need to go below that price."
