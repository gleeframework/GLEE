"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll get great value from it.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $14,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $15,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value this product will bring you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $15,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $14,000, so I'll offer $14,750. That's as high as I'm willing to go.",14750.0,Bob,6,
