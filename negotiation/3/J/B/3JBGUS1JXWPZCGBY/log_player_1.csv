Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll get great value from it."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $14,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $15,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $14,000, so I'll offer $14,750. That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above $15,000. He's sticking to small increments and we're running out of rounds. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
