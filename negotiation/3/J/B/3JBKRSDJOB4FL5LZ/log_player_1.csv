"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but well above my minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high starting point gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can subtly influence Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $980,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to secure a deal, accepting such a low offer would leave a substantial amount of money on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it falls quite a bit short of the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects my commitment to making a deal, but also acknowledges the significant value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Adjustment:**  I've reduced my price by $50,000 to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm still holding firm well above Bob's offer to signal that his initial price was too low. 
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm subtly pushing back against Bob's attempt to undervalue it.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The language encourages Bob to meet me closer to my price point, aiming for a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,020,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but $1,020,000 is still below my desired profit margin.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to incentivize Bob to move closer to my range.  Rejecting this offer maintains pressure and shows I'm not desperate to accept the first offer above $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we're still not quite there. I'm willing to make a significant move and come down to $1,075,000.  This is my final offer. It represents a substantial discount and reflects my desire to close this deal today."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession (but with conditions):** I'm making a substantial jump down to $1,075,000, signaling flexibility and a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and limiting further back-and-forth, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While a concession, the $1,075,000 price still provides a healthy profit margin above my minimum and avoids appearing desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your position, but I would like to counter with an offer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I set a ""final offer"" in the previous round, accepting $1,050,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Strong Profit:** This price still yields a $50,000 profit, which is a good outcome.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to push Bob could backfire. He might walk away, leaving me to accept John's lower offer.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation and allows me to move on to other opportunities. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting a price slightly below my ""final offer"" can be seen as a gesture of goodwill, potentially benefiting future interactions with Bob."
