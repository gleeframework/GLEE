Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I know is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, for a price that's fair to both of us.  I believe this is a chance for you to acquire something truly valuable.  Consider this offer carefully, as I'm confident you'll see the tremendous benefit it holds."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and presenting it as a win-win situation. I don't want to push him away with an aggressive price, so I'm using a more persuasive approach.
* **Product price:**  I'm offering the product at the minimum acceptable price for me, $1,000,000. This ensures that I get my minimum desired value while still leaving the possibility of a slight negotiation with Bob.

**Why this approach:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:** By offering the product at $1,000,000, I'm maximizing the potential profit while still keeping the offer reasonable for Bob. 
* **Avoids unnecessary risk:** There's no need to take a risk with a lower offer when I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Focuses on value:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, which increases the chances of him accepting the offer.

This approach is a balance between securing a good deal and not scaring off a potential buyer."
