# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's higher than his maximum budget, and there's still room for negotiation. He can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate you reaching out.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tight."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget is tight. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This still gives you a great value for the product, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still over his budget. He can continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for being flexible. I'm still a bit above my budget at $9,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm ready to move forward if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8,750 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  This is a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's seal the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown willingness to compromise, and Alice has shown flexibility, so there's still potential for a deal that works for both of them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting really close!  $8,900 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,800?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 8800}
