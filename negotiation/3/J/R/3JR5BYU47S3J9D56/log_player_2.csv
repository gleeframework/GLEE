"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly bluffing. She wouldn't sell the product for less than its value to her ($1,200,000). By rejecting her offer, you call her bluff and open the door for a better deal. While you could buy from John for $1,500,000, there's a chance Alice will come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale."
