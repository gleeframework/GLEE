{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows I'm willing to be flexible and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is a better offer than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120, so how about $122.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $122.50 isn't my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable value of $100 and it's likely the best I can get from Bob. It's better than selling to John, and it shows I'm flexible and willing to reach a deal."
