"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating. There are 9 rounds left, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. Offering $13,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is only slightly better than her initial offer and still leaves Bob with a decent amount of room to negotiate.  While Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, it's better to keep negotiating, especially since there are 7 rounds left. He can try to get a lower price and may end up with a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to slowly chip away at Alice's asking price. Offering $13,500 is a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest counter-offer.  This shows Bob is serious about negotiating while also demonstrating that he's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is the same as John's price. Bob's goal is to save money, and since he can buy from John for the same price as Alice's offer, there's no reason to keep negotiating. There are 5 rounds left, but there's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further. It's better to avoid any risk and buy from John, who is offering a guaranteed price."
