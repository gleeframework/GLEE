"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll propose $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $975,000 is still too low.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and could be a great opportunity for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $987,500.
