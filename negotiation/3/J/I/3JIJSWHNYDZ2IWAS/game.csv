"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1200000, and I'm willing to make a significant compromise to make this deal happen.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to me is $800000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $775000. This is as close to the middle ground as I'm willing to go. I hope you'll consider it.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $750000. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I'd like to make one final offer, and I'm sticking to $750000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000.",750000.0,Bob,6,
