"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $150 from John. While Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a backup option with John at $150, you can aim for a price closer to your maximum budget.  A $130 offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving some space for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within your budget and is a better deal than buying from John at $150.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you might end up paying more for the product from John. It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure a good price."
