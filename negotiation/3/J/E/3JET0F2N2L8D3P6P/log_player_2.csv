"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do better than $70, but I need to make a profit. How about $85?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $77 and $85, so how about $81? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from Alice at this point. Accepting $81 saves us $19 compared to John's offer."
