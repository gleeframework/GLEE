"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to my budget of $1,200,000. Can you consider my offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to come down that far. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a very good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $1,075,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my revised offer?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
