I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob and I are too far apart on price, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation. While I'd prefer to get more than $10,000, selling to John guarantees me a sale that meets my minimum price requirement."
