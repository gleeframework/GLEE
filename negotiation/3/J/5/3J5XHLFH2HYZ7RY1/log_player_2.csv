"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  It's a fair price, but Bob's goal is to save money. There's no reason to accept on the first round when there are more rounds available to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts by offering a significantly lower price, 20% less than Alice's initial offer. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob's willingness to bargain and sets the tone for the remaining rounds. While $1,000,000 is still a significant price, it leaves room for both parties to reach a compromise that benefits them both."
