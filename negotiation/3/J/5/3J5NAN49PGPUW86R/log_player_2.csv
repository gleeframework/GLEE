"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is good, but there's room for negotiation. Since I have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, I want to see if I can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she'll become less willing to compromise.  Accepting her offer at $1,100,000 saves me $400,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to me."
