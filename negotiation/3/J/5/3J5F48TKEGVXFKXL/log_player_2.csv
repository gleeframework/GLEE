"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Significant Difference:** My counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal but am willing to negotiate.
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a respectful tone is crucial for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,400,000. This is a more reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, but it's still far above my maximum budget. I need to show her I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to encourage her to make a more substantial move towards a price I'd consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can go up to $700,000.  That's a firm offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, But With Limits:** I've increased my offer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also setting a firm limit. This signals my seriousness and my potential to walk away.
* **Introducing Alternatives:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have John as a backup. This could encourage her to be more flexible.
* **Direct and Respectful:**  The message is straightforward and avoids emotional language, which is important in maintaining a professional negotiation."
