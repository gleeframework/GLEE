"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's plenty of time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high.  I'm confident I can get a better price, and I have 7 rounds left to do so.  It's important to keep pushing for a price that's more in line with my desired range."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high. I'm not in a rush and have 5 rounds left. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push her down to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  $1,050,000 is still a little outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away happy with the deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept $1,025,000.  I have 3 rounds left and I believe I can still get a better deal.  It's important to hold firm and see if Alice is willing to drop to my target price of $1,000,000."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still sticking with your offer of $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Alice has come very close to my desired price. While I'd prefer $1,000,000, $1,015,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product than risk losing it and having to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
