Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is upbeat and focuses on the value Bob will receive, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:**  By leaving room for negotiation, I can either:
    * Secure a sale at a price closer to my desired amount.
    *  Continue negotiating if Bob makes a counteroffer.
    *  Move on to John if the negotiation stalls or Bob's counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, potentially closer to my initial offer of $13,000. 
* **Avoiding immediate loss:** Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss for me. By rejecting, I can continue trying to find a more favorable price.
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  While I'm pursuing a deal with Bob, I'm not abandoning John. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that he's getting a great deal.
* **Creating urgency:** I subtly express that this is a significant compromise, implying that I may not be willing to go lower.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for further discussion, allowing Bob to make another counteroffer if needed.

This counteroffer allows me to:

* **Potentially secure a sale:** If Bob accepts, I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Maintain leverage:** If Bob rejects, I can still negotiate further or move on to John.
* **Show good faith:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about making a deal but also that I'm not desperate to sell at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $500 away from my previous offer of $11,500. This is a small difference, and I'm willing to accept it to secure a sale.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer, especially since his offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a backup:**  I still have John as a backup, so I'm not taking a huge risk by accepting. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer allows me to make a sale and avoid further negotiation that could lead to a stalemate."
