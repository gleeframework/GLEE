Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're getting close to the price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,800. I'm willing to give you a bit more flexibility and offer the product to you for $11,100. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Savings:** You're getting the product for $900 less than John's price.
* **Finality:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  Further haggling might make her less willing to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Trying to get the price lower (e.g., $11,000) risks her walking away, forcing you to buy from John at full price."
