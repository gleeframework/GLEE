"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident I can find a similar product for closer to my budget.  If you're serious about selling, I'm willing to offer $10,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",10750.0,Bob,4,
