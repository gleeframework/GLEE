"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is offering $2,000 less than my initial ask, but still $2,000 above my minimum. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate him up a bit. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I'm looking for something a little closer to my initial price.  Would you consider $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,000 is closer but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is now very close to my previous counter-offer and is offering a price significantly above my minimum. There's a risk he walks away if I counter again.
