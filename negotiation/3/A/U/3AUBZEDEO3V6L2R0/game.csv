"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125 right now. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. Let's see if we can find common ground.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $140. Let's try to make this happen.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $140 is still a bit too low for me, but I want to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $150? That would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
