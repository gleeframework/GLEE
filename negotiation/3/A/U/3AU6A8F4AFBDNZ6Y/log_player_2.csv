(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still above your preferred price point. You have only 3 rounds left and the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice is increasing. Given that John is offering the product for your maximum budget, it's the safest option to secure the product from him and avoid further risk of negotiation failure."
