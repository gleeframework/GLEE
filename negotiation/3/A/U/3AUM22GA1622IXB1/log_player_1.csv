Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, so we're not desperate to sell below our minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
