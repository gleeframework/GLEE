Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** The product is of significant value to both you and Bob. This justifies aiming high.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 with John allows you to take a calculated risk with Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  There's a chance Bob values the product even more than you do, or that he's willing to pay a premium for exclusivity. This justifies offering a price significantly higher than your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, and you'll miss out on the potential $500,000 profit. However, the potential reward of a successful high offer is substantial."
