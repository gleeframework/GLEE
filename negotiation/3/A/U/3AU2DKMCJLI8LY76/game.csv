"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however, my initial offer reflects the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'm proposing $900,000. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
