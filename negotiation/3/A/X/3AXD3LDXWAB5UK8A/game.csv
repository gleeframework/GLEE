"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140?  That's still a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. Can you meet me at $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $130 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference -  $135.  That way we both get a good deal and we can close this out.",135.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I can go any higher than $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132.50? That's the best I can do.",132.5,Bob,6,
