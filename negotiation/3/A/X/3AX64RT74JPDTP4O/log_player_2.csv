"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $9,000 for the product. This is significantly lower than her asking price of $12,000, but still higher than her minimum selling price of $8,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate, but also incentivizes her to consider my offer as it's a good deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is significantly better than John's offer of $15,000. Even though I could try to negotiate further, there is no guarantee I will get a better price from Alice.  Accepting her offer secures the product at a price well within my budget and saves me $4,500 compared to buying from John."
