"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but it's still within a reasonable range considering my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I have a better chance of getting closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his valuation. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I also haven't completely conceded to his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm losing rounds, I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer again, but still above my minimum price.  Since Bob keeps offering lower prices, I need to signal that I'm serious about wanting to sell to him, but not at such a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  Although I'm not getting my desired price, I'm closer to my minimum acceptable price with John.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
