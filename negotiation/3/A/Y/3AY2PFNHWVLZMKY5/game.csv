"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to adjusting the price based on your feedback.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, I think $900,000 is a bit high. How about we bring it down to $700,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects its true value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, my budget tops out at $800,000.  If you're willing to meet that, we have a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
