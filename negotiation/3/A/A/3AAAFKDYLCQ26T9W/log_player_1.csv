Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your discerning taste.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,750,000.  Given its value, I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to discussing further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,750,000 vs. $1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Alice to secure a price closer to her desired outcome. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and Alice's confidence in its worth, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** While aiming high, Alice expresses willingness to discuss the price, showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Safety Net:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,500,000, ensuring she won't be forced to accept a price lower than her minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving room for a mutually agreeable deal."
