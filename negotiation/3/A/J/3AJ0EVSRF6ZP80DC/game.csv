"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to make a more reasonable offer. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
