"Hi Alice, thanks for reaching out. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $18,000 represents the high-end of its value, I can't go as low as $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle on $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
