Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $200 is far too high for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $200 represents its true value, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $160? "", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still out of my range.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $100. It's the absolute most I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to go that low. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm confident this product is worth more than your offer, but I'd like to find a solution. If I lower the price to $130, would that be acceptable?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $130 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it, or we can continue discussing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear Bob is unwilling to budge beyond $100.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer, and it risks missing out on John's guaranteed $150 offer."
