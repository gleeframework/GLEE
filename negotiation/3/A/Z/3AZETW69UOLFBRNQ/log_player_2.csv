"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way too high. It's well above your maximum budget of $100. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $200 is far too high for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $200 represents its true value, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $160?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $100, so I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still out of my range.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $100. It's the absolute most I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to go that low."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm confident this product is worth more than your offer, but I'd like to find a solution. If I lower the price to $130, would that be acceptable? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is good. However, $130 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my goal of $100, so I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further. There are still several rounds left, so there's time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $130 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it, or we can continue discussing."", ""product_price"": 100}
