Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000 with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, I can't go as low as $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that still allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $1,000,000. I'm not convinced that $950,000 is the best I can get from Bob, especially since John is willing to pay $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While I value your perspective, $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to walk away happy with the outcome. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
