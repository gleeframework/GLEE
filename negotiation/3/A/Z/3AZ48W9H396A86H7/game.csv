"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500.  Would that be possible?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $7,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
