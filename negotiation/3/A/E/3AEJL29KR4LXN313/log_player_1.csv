Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value is $1,200,000 to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While meeting halfway between our valuations might seem fair on the surface, it doesn't reflect the product's true worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a significant loss. I'll provide a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's actual value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price that reflects the value this product offers. I propose a price of $1,350,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your initial offer was $1,500,000 and you've come down to $1,350,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** This price still nets me a $25,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate increases the risk of Bob walking away. It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially lose him altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows me to allocate my time and resources elsewhere."
