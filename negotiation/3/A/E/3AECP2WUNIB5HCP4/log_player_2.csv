Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $99 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $101. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is very slowly decreasing her offer price. It's unlikely further haggling will result in a significantly better deal, and waiting runs the risk of Alice increasing her price or the deal falling through.  Taking the $101 offer is the most logical choice now."
