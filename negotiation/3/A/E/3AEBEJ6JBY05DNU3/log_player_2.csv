{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,800,000 is way above his maximum budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is too low for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This reflects the true value and potential of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$1,500,000 is still a bit too high. Bob should try to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,500,000 is still above my comfortable price point. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer is fair given my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly discounts the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. While $1,300,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. He should try to negotiate with Alice further, but if she doesn't come down to his desired price, he should buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows me to stay within my financial limits. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to look elsewhere for the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
