"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, it's still above the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer.  He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than the product's worth to her. This shows he's serious about buying but wants a good deal. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down to $9500, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is a good price for Bob. It's still higher than the product's value to Alice, but lower than John's price.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to save $2,500 compared to buying from John, while also giving Alice a decent profit margin."
