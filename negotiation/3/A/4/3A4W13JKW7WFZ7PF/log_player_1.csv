"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is a good starting point to maximize my profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefit for Bob, making him more likely to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I mention the possibility of finding a price we're both happy with,  leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $10000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is Higher:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible, and $9,000 is still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to my ideal $10,000. 
* **Not desperate:** I'm not desperate to sell, as I have the option to sell to John for $8,000. This gives me leverage to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but only slightly. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a strong position.
* **Finality:**  By stating it's my final offer, I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider accepting.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm still trying to close the deal at a price closer to my desired value, as it's worth $12,000 to Bob."
