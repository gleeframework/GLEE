"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great investment for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to engage in a discussion, showing I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Note:**  I'm setting a high starting price, but I'm aware that I can always take the $1,000,000 offer from John if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in the initial rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only justify going as high as $700,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and even lower than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Leverage.**  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price point closer to my desired value while still staying within a range that Bob might find appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is lower than I anticipated, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but Maintaining Value:** I'm coming down from my initial offer but still maintaining a price point significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Benefits:**  I'm reminding Bob that $900,000 is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** I'm using a positive tone and framing the offer as a way to find common ground, encouraging further negotiation.

**Important Note:** I'm aware that I could still sell to John for $1,000,000. However, I'm choosing to continue negotiating with Bob as there's still a chance to secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still pushing my budget. I could consider going up to $750,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and even below his own perceived value of $800,000.
* **Negotiations are ongoing.**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he's showing a willingness to negotiate and increase his offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I can continue to guide the negotiation and make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.

**Next Steps:**  I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground that is closer to my desired value while still being within a range that Bob might find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $750,000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $850,000? This would be a great opportunity for you, and it would also allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising and Showing Flexibility:** I'm again making a counteroffer that shows I'm willing to negotiate.  The $850,000 price is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win, emphasizing that $850,000 is a good deal for both of us. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:**  I'm suggesting that accepting this offer will allow me to move forward with the sale, subtly implying that I might consider other offers if he doesn't accept.

**Important Note:** I'm still considering selling to John for $1,000,000, but I'm determined to get as close to that price as possible through negotiation with Bob. This strategy of gradual compromise and maintaining a positive yet assertive tone is likely to yield the best result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while respecting both of our budgets. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's an improvement, $775,000 is still significantly below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Time is running out.** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds. I need to get closer to my desired price quickly.
* **Maintaining leverage and seeking a better offer.**  By rejecting his offer, I can continue to guide the negotiation and make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current offers and secure a price closer to my desired value.  However, I will also need to consider the possibility of accepting John's offer if Bob continues to be unwilling to budge."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $775,000 is still significantly below what I need to move forward.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach an agreement.  I'm confident that this is a good deal for you, and I hope we can finalize it."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $825,000 is a good deal for him, and I'm emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** I'm expressing that I need to reach an agreement to move forward, putting subtle pressure on Bob to consider my offer. 

**Important Note:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I'm willing to compromise further, I'm also keeping the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 in mind.  I need to be prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
