"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. My asking price is $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a high offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $100 is a good starting point because it allows for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Friendly approach:** I want to keep the negotiation amicable and open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is still lower than my desired price:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired $100.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** It's still early in the negotiation, and I have several rounds left to try and secure a better price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  Selling to John is always an option if the negotiations fail, but I want to maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $95? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give away too much. $95 is a good middle ground.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing ""fair compromise"" and ""good deal"" to encourage Bob to see this as a win-win situation. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $95 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your initial asking price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:**  $92 is only $3 away from my desired price of $95. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk him walking away.  
* **Time is running out:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to start closing the deal.  
* **Selling to John is a backup:** Even if I accept Bob's offer, I still have the option of selling to John if negotiations with other buyers go better in the future."
