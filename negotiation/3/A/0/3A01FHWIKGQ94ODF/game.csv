"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our respective budgets.",875000.0,Bob,4,
