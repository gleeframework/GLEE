"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its incredible value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a strong offer of $950,000 sets a high anchor point. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""its worth to you"") reinforces its desirability and justifies the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""starting price"" and ""proposing"" indicates willingness to negotiate, fostering a collaborative atmosphere.

This approach balances assertiveness with flexibility, setting the stage for potentially lucrative rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting would be a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation. I have room to counter and try to reach a more favorable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's unique capabilities.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $875,000.  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** Briefly explaining why I'm rejecting Bob's offer prevents the negotiation from becoming adversarial.
* **Significant Concession (but above minimum):**  My counteroffer of $875,000 is a substantial drop from my initial ask but remains comfortably above my minimum acceptable price and John's offer.  
* **Value Reiteration:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's value to him, justifying the higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** Emphasizing compromise and finding a ""middle ground"" encourages Bob to engage constructively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need us to find a price point that works for me. Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $750,000 is still below my absolute minimum of $800,000. Bob is clearly interested and engaging in the negotiation, showing a willingness to move. I'm confident I can nudge him closer to my desired outcome in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle on $812,500? This reflects a final concession on my part to ensure we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 812500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Momentum:**  Acknowledging progress and expressing appreciation for Bob's willingness to negotiate maintains a good atmosphere.
* **Compromise Framing:**  Suggesting a ""split the difference"" approach frames my counteroffer as a fair compromise rather than another round of haggling.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Moving to $812,500 is a small concession but keeps the price firmly above my minimum and John's offer.
* **Finality:**  Mentioning this is my ""final concession"" introduces a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept this favorable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I could meet you halfway at $781,250.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $781,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $781,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very slowly moving towards my price, but he's still significantly under my $800,000 safety net with John. At this pace, it's unlikely Bob will reach a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
