"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,100,000.

Round 5

Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is still a great deal, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very reluctant to drop below $1,050,000. While we could try to push for a slightly better deal, it's getting riskier. Accepting at $1,075,000 secures a significant savings of $425,000 compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of Alice becoming less flexible in later rounds."
