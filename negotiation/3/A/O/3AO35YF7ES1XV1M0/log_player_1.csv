"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to push for the highest price possible.  This will also give me a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still below my ideal target.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price and potentially close the deal at a more favorable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a significant profit for me.  I believe Bob is serious about buying, and this price might be attractive enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $925,000 is a good deal.  It's a significant profit, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
