"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to see if you can get a better price, especially since you have 10 rounds and a backup option.  A counteroffer will give you more information about Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount. This will give us an idea of Alice's flexibility and potentially start a negotiation dance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  I'm going to reject and counteroffer again.  There's still room for improvement, and I want to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $925,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still want a better deal. It's a small enough increment to potentially be acceptable to her, while still getting closer to my goal."
