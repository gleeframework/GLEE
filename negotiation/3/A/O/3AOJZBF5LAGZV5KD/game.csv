"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be open to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I have to make a living, you know. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. How about we discuss around that price point?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a personalized setup service. How about we finalize the deal at $12,000 with these extras?",12000.0,Alice,7,
