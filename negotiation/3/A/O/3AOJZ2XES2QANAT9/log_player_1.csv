Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for your consideration. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for myself.
* **Fairness:**  The price is lower than Bob's perceived value, suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Open Communication:**  The message encourages Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation moving.
* **Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a fallback option if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's above John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit.
* **Room for Negotiation.** Bob's interest indicates a willingness to negotiate further.  I can likely get closer to my asking price with a counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but risking a few more rounds of negotiation has the potential for a much higher return."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,100,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit and reflects the value of the product. I'm open to discussing further, but this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** The counteroffer is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The price is still above my minimum ($1,000,000) and leaves some room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Finality:**  Stating it's the final offer creates pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Opportunity to Close:**  The message highlights the value of the product and reiterates the potential benefits for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is just $50,000 below my previous counteroffer. This is a small enough difference to potentially close the deal.
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation could drag out the process and risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely.
* **Safe Margin:**  While not ideal, $1,150,000 is still a substantial profit and significantly higher than selling to John. 

Given the potential for a quick deal and a reasonable profit, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best course of action."
