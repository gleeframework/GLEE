"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product of significant value.  I believe it could be incredibly beneficial for your business. I'm asking for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000?  It's a fair compromise considering the value of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a really good price, and it reflects the potential value I know this product can bring to your business. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that the price is still a bit too high. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
