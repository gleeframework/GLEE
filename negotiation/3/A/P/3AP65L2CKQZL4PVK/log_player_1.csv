"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal, while still leaving me with a healthy profit. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone helps build rapport and may make Bob more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.**  While it's tempting to take the $80, I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **I have 9 more rounds to negotiate.**  There's still plenty of time to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.** If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is still above my minimum:**  $90 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, allowing me to keep a decent profit.
* **Splitting the difference:**  This shows I'm willing to compromise, making Bob feel like he's getting a fair deal.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that. 
* **More negotiation time:**  I have 6 rounds left. It's worth continuing to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer is always there:**  If we can't agree on a price, I can always sell to John for $120."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, coming down from $90 to $95. This shows flexibility and willingness to work with Bob.
* **Still above minimum:** $95 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, which might encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Positive tone:**  The message uses a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $87? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I am committed to making at least $120. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We are getting closer to the end of the negotiation.  If we don't reach an acceptable price soon, selling to John might be the best option.
* **John's Offer is Attractive:** John is willing to pay $120, which is a significant amount more than Bob's current offer.

I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds, but I am prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go down to $92.  This is getting close to my bottom line, but I'd still like to see this deal happen.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer (Almost):** $92 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I'm hoping this is a good enough concession to make Bob accept.
* **Emphasize Willingness:** I emphasize that I'm willing to make this deal happen, hoping it will convince Bob to accept.
* **Limited Time:** We're in the 7th round and there's not much time left.  If this doesn't work, I'm prepared to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $92 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $88? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in Round 8, with only two rounds left.  
* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.

At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John and secure the higher price. There's not enough time left to potentially get a better deal from Bob."
