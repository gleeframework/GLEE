Alice's offer:

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I see you're willing to meet me closer to the middle. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I can go as low as $14,000. This is my final offer - I have another interested buyer who's ready to purchase at that price. Let me know if this works for you.

Explanation:  Alice is holding firm at $14,000. It's unlikely she'll go down significantly.  You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $12,000, saving you $2,000.  At this point, it's more strategic to go with the sure bet and buy from John."
