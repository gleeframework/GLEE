Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 (and have a guaranteed offer at that price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  Any price between $800,001 and $999,999 could theoretically work.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob automatically walks away. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. Let me know your thoughts â€“ this offer stands for the next 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message emphasizes exclusivity and value.
* **High Anchor:** The $925,000 price is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation but aiming for a significant profit.
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to decide quickly. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to negotiate down slightly, but hold firm to a price above your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Walk Away if Needed:**  If Bob is unwilling to meet your price range, you have the safety net of John's offer."
