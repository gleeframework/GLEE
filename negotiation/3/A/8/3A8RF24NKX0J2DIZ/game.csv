"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While I do appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  how about $130?  It's still a great price for a product you'll love! ",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's the highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $100 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go up to $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
