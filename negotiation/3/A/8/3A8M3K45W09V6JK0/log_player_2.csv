"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know how valuable it would be for your business, so I'm starting the negotiations at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $1,100,000 is below your maximum, it's still too close to your limit. There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for better deal:** You can try to get a lower price from Alice.  
* **No immediate pressure:** You have 10 rounds, so you're not in a hurry to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counter:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. However, it's not so low that it seems unreasonable or insulting. 
* **Focus on value:** The message highlights the value of the product to both parties, emphasizing a collaborative approach. 
* **Open to compromise:** The message indicates that you are willing to compromise and find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:** While $1,025,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still more than you're willing to pay. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's still room for you to negotiate a lower price.
* **No immediate pressure:** You still have 7 rounds left, so you can continue to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value we both place on this product, I'm willing to offer $975,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring it, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant counteroffer:** The offer is only $50,000 less than Alice's, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  However, it keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further.
* **Focus on fair compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Reinforcing interest:** The message restates your interest in the product to encourage Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This product is very valuable to me, and I'm only willing to let it go for a price that reflects that.  Would you consider $1,000,000? I believe this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your limit:**  $1,000,000 is a significant saving compared to buying from John, and only $25,000 more than your last counteroffer.
* **Alice's final offer:**  Alice has indicated that this is her final offer.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk she might walk away.
* **Limited time:** You've already used 5 rounds, and time is running out.

It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price than to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher cost."
