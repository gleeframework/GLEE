"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $80. I'm offering the product to you for $85. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $70, which would be $77.50. Can you consider that price?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $77.50 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $90, which would be $82.50. It's a slight increase from your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $70, which would be $80. I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower, and I'm starting to think that buying from John for $80 might be a better option. Can you meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,6,
