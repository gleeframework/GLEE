"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high quality and unique features, it's valued at $150 by many of our customers. Considering its worth to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its value and your needs. Would you be interested in exploring options that could make this valuable product yours? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's opening message is full of sales tactics, emphasizing a higher perceived value ($150) to justify her offer. 
* While $120 is less than your maximum budget and John's price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal that the price isn't ideal. Alice will likely counter with a lower price, getting you closer to a true bargain."
