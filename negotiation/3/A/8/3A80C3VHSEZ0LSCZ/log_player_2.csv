The price is way too high for Bob.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, so he's going to start by offering the minimum he's willing to pay. This puts pressure on Alice to either accept and make a sale, or risk losing the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to her initial offer.  While John offers a lower price, accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to potentially get a slightly better product or better negotiating terms in the future."
