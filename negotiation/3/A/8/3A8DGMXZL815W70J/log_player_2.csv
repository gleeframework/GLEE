"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to your desired price range, you can still potentially get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, you have the opportunity to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  Offering $850,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it's a significant step towards your desired price of $800,000 but still potentially attractive to Alice, who values the product at $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is only $75,000 over your desired price.  While further negotiation could potentially get you closer to your goal, the risk of losing the deal to John or having a drawn-out negotiation makes accepting this offer the most sensible choice."
