I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more and I want to see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob seems unwilling to budge from his price. While I'd prefer to make a higher profit, I'm comfortable selling to John for $1,200,000 and securing a guaranteed sale."
