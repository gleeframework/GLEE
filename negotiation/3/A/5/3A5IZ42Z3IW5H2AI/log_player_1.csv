Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. It's also significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, which might encourage him to accept.  

However, I'm also keeping in mind my backup option with John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject this counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm also considering the option of selling to John, as his offer of $1,000,000 is more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground with this counteroffer. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility.  This price point is closer to my goal of $900,000 and I think it's a fair compromise. It's also closer to John's offer,  making it easier for me to justify accepting if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that $875,000 is a bit out of my range. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $860,000 is still below my desired price point.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,000,000.  Given the potential for further negotiation with Bob, it's risky to continue the process. The potential gains are not significant enough to outweigh the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  

I'm choosing to sell to John, as it guarantees me a higher price and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
