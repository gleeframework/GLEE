"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  Let's see if we can make this happen.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that $875,000 is a bit out of my range. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're willing to accept.",860000.0,Bob,4,
