{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategic. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can lower the price a bit, but I have John as a backup if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $12,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. While I don't want to lose him as a potential buyer, I'm not willing to sell below my floor price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $13,500? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still looking to get closer to your asking price, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum value.  I'm willing to take the deal to avoid risking losing him completely and having to rely on John, who is willing to pay more, but might also be less flexible in the future."
