"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1250000.  It's a significant value for you at this price, and it's a fair deal for me.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is better than the price from John, it's still above Bob's maximum price. Bob can get the same product for a lower price from John, making rejecting Alice's offer the most beneficial choice."
