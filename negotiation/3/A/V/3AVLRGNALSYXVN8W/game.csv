"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value significantly exceeds that.  I could consider letting it go for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $13,000? This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
