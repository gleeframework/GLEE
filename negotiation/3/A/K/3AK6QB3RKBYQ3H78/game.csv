"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so how about we meet at $150? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",150.0,Alice,5,
