{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm looking for something closer to my original asking price. How about $88?  I think that's fair considering the value of this product to you."", ""product_price"": 88}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's not the full $90 I was aiming for, but it's only $2 less and significantly more than selling to John. I want to close the deal and move on."
