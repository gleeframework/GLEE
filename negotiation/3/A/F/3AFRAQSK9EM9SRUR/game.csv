"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford at this time.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,350,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,400,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer on a product of this quality.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am still not able to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose $1,375,000 as a compromise. This allows me to stay within my budget while still making a fair offer for the product.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
