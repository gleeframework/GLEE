# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum price of $10,000. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While $16,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $14,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While Alice has come down in price, $15,500 is still over your budget of $10,000. It's now time to go with the guaranteed deal from John. You'll save $5,500 by going with John."
