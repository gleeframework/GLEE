"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Since my maximum budget is $1,000,000, I'm offering the maximum I'm willing to pay. This establishes a clear starting point for negotiation and shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is significantly lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I want to keep trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's still a chance Alice might come down further, and I haven't exhausted all rounds yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is still a significant discount from Alice's last offer and is within my budget. This move aims to signal that I'm serious about buying the product while still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $1,600,000 is tempting, I still have some negotiating room. I'm closer to my ideal price, but I'm not quite there yet.  I have 5 rounds left, and I think I can get a better deal if I keep pushing.  I'm also concerned about Alice's willingness to compromise. She hasn't shown much flexibility so far."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget. This counteroffer is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest price.  The goal is to encourage Alice to come down further, ideally to a price closer to $1,300,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $1,550,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me one more chance to counteroffer and potentially reach a better price. If Alice continues to be inflexible, I can always fall back on John's offer in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. My goal is to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still pushing for a lower price. $1,450,000 is a compromise, and I'm hoping it will encourage Alice to make a final concession. With only two rounds left, I need to be cautious about risking John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation, and while Alice's offer is better than her previous ones, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm worried that with only one round left, I might end up with a price that's too high. It's more prudent to go with John's offer at $1,000,000, which is a guaranteed price within my budget. It's better to secure a deal than risk losing out on the product entirely."
