Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Offering the product at $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for a higher profit margin. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It signals that you're open to discussion while still aiming for a significant profit. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have the time and resources to potentially negotiate with Bob. If you need to sell quickly, offering it closer to John's price might be more efficient."
