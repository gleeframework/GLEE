{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, and this price offers a good margin.
* **It's within Bob's budget:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to him, so he's likely to consider it.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This gives you flexibility if Bob wants to counteroffer.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your initial offer and even below your minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a more profitable and guaranteed option. However, rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.  

The strategy is to try to meet somewhere in the middle, as long as it's above your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $1,050,000? It's a good middle ground that gives you a premium price while still ensuring a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a higher price:** $1,050,000 is still above your minimum and offers a substantial profit.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  You're demonstrating flexibility while not giving away too much.
* **Appeal to Bob's logic:** It presents a 'middle ground' that might be more appealing than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While you could continue to negotiate, the potential for further concessions is limited. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which aligns with your minimum price and ensures you don't lose out on potential profit. It's the most reliable option in this situation."
