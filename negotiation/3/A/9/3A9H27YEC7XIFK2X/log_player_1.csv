Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit margin of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) if you can sell it to Bob for more than his valuation.

**The Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob while still exceeding your minimum.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit your operations. To make this a win-win, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Positioning:** The message starts by emphasizing the product's value.
* **""Win-Win"":**  Framing it as mutually beneficial encourages agreement.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,350,000 is $150,000 above Bob's valuation, but still $150,000 less than your guaranteed offer. This gives Bob a good deal while still securing you a significant profit.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is fluid. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust slightly, but remember your minimum price."
