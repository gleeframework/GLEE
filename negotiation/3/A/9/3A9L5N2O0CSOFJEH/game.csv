"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the price I could get it from John.  Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
