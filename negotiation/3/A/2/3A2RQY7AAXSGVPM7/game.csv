"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while leaving room for a profitable partnership.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget. I could go up to $700,000 if you're willing to negotiate further.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we seem to have different perspectives on the product's value.  I've adjusted my price significantly already, and to be frank,  $700,000  falls short of what I can accept. If you're serious about purchasing, I'm willing to consider  $1,500,000. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
