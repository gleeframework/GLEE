"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price of $1400000.  It's a fair deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. How about we meet at $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1250000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1275000. That's a small increase from your offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's close this out!",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1275000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1260000?",1260000.0,Bob,6,
