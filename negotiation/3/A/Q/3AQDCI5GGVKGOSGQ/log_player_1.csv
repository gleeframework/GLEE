Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price of $1,400,000.  It's a fair deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I can potentially do better.  Bob clearly sees value in the product, and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. How about we meet at $1250000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up a bit, I'm still not satisfied with his offer. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,275,000. That's a small increase from your offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's close this out!"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1275000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1260000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob is getting closer to my desired price point and we've reached the halfway point in our negotiations.  Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely. It's also important to consider the time constraint, and selling now is better than potentially getting a lower offer later."
