"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell it. Let's make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
