"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $12,500?  It's still a good value for you, and a fair price for me.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $11,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,500? This is a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
