"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that I know will be of great benefit to you. I'm confident this price is fair, given its worth to both of us.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850,000 is a step closer, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This would allow us both to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to agree to $875,000. I would like to propose $860,000 as a potential compromise. I hope this aligns better with your needs.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good price, and I respect that.  $860,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit off.  How about we go with $865,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the deal.  Let me know what you think.",865000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. After careful consideration, I am proposing $862,500 as a potential compromise. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you, allowing us to finalize the transaction.",862500.0,Bob,6,
