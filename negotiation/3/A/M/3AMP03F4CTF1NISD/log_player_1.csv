I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell right now. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a price higher than Bob's initial offer. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."

Bob has made it clear he's not willing to budge from his initial offer. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I don't want to waste more time negotiating. John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is my minimum, so I'll take that option."
