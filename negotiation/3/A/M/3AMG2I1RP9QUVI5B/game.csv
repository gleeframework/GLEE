"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,125,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
