"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's valuable to both parties. For this opportunity, I propose a price of $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In order to move forward, I would like to suggest a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a compromise between our initial offers and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering both our positions. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. To try and bridge the gap, I am willing to consider $875,000 as the price for the product. This is a step towards meeting your budget while still valuing the product at its true worth. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
