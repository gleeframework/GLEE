"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset for a price below its true worth to you. I understand you value this at $1,000,000, so this represents a substantial return on your investment. Consider this offer carefully, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $1,000,000."
