"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While your offer is tempting, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save more. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still well below his perceived value of the product. While his offer is increasing, we are still in a strong negotiating position. We need to push him further towards our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, the value of this product is truly substantial and reflected in my pricing. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,220,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1220000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firmness:**  We need to signal to Bob that we're serious about the product's value. Stating this is our ""final offer"" adds weight, even if we might be willing to negotiate further.
* **Small Concession:**  Lowering the price by $30,000 shows some flexibility but keeps us anchored near our desired range.
* **Time Pressure:**  As rounds progress, the implicit pressure of John's offer at $800,000 increases. Bob might be more willing to settle sooner rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly dropped his offer, indicating he might be testing our resolve. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss compared to our previous positions and the product's value to both of us. We need to show we're willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've tried to be accommodating, but your latest offer is simply too far from what I consider fair.  I'm willing to accept $1,180,000, but this is my absolute final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1180000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Language:** Phrases like ""too far from what I consider fair"" and ""absolute final offer"" emphasize our seriousness and the risk of the deal falling through.
* **Smaller Concession:** A $40,000 reduction is a compromise, but a smaller one, signifying our diminishing flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Explicitly mentioning ""other options"" reminds Bob of John's standing offer and the potential for us to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's offer has barely increased, and he's showing reluctance to move closer to our desired price range.  This suggests further negotiation might be fruitless.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While $1,080,000 is a significant sum, the potential gain from continued negotiation is shrinking compared to the risk of Bob further lowballing or the deal falling apart entirely.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $800,000 guarantees a substantial profit, even if it's less than we hoped for with Bob. This ""bird in the hand"" is becoming increasingly attractive compared to the uncertain outcome with Bob."
