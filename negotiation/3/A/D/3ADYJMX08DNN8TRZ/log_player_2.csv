Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This reflects the value I see and allows for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Round 3

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to jump to her middle ground. I'll counter with a lower price and see where we can meet in the middle."
