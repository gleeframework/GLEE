"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This reflects the value I see and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try $750,000. This is a fair compromise and keeps the deal within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $850,000, but that's my final offer. This price reflects the true worth of the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is my absolute limit. This price reflects the true value of the product for me, and I believe it would be a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
