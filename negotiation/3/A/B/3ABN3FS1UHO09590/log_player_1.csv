Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $120 is lower than Bob's valuation of $150, giving him room to negotiate if he wants. 

This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest while still leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in buying the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, it's still lower than my initial offer and leaves less profit for me. It's worth pushing for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my original offer, how about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in buying the product, but I was thinking $105 is a more reasonable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell for closer to $110, Bob has shown he's willing to pay a bit more than his initial $100 offer.  Accepting $105 gives me a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could potentially lead to a lower price or a sale to John for less."
