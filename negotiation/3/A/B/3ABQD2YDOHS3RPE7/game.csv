"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110. This price still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $95 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",102.5,Alice,5,
