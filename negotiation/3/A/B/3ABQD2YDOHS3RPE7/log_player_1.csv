Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and focuses on mutual benefit.
* **Open-Ended:** The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while remaining open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($150).**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to make the deal worthwhile for me.
* **I want to see if I can negotiate a better price.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110. This price still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Mutually Beneficial Deal:** I reiterate the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question encourages Bob to engage in further discussion.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping my options open.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($150).** While $95 is a slight improvement over $90, it's still not enough for me to make a worthwhile profit.
* **I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150. 
* **I'm willing to continue negotiating.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make another counteroffer and try to push for a price closer to my desired range. 

I'm willing to compromise, but I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $95 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's current offer ($95). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin. 
* **Fairness and mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" and ""mutual benefit"" of the proposed price.
* **Open-ended question:** The question encourages Bob to consider the offer and respond, potentially leading to a successful deal. 

By offering a compromise and highlighting the fairness of the price, I'm hoping to convince Bob to accept the offer. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary and am always aware of the option to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($150).** While $92.50 is a slight improvement over $90, it's still not enough for me to make a worthwhile profit.
* **The negotiation has gone on long enough.**  I've made multiple concessions and Bob is unwilling to come up significantly in his offer.
* **John is a guaranteed buyer for $150.** I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially lose a better deal with John. 

It's time to end the negotiation with Bob and secure the sale with John for a price that meets my minimum requirements."
