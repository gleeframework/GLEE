"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being too aggressive and am open to Bob's counteroffer.

This approach allows me to maximize my potential profit while also giving Bob a chance to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $12000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $12,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get a better price. 
* **Potential for Higher Value:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since I'm not under immediate pressure to sell. 
* **Using John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the flexibility to reject low offers and focus on getting the best deal possible. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, hopefully finding a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. It's a fair price that reflects its worth. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** I'm emphasizing a collaborative approach and showing an interest in finding a mutually agreeable price.

This counteroffer aims to maintain a reasonable profit margin while also encouraging Bob to reconsider and potentially come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I would like to propose a price of $13500. This is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not under pressure to accept yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I need to, so I can afford to be a bit more patient.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can gauge his seriousness and see how far he's willing to go.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, aiming to find a price closer to my initial goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for $14,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by coming down slightly from my previous offer.
* **Focus on Middle Ground:**  I'm suggesting a middle ground between our current positions to encourage a deal.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and focused on finding a solution.

By maintaining a balance between firmness and compromise, I hope to entice Bob to accept this counteroffer, leading us closer to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $14000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $14,500. It's a significant improvement from his previous offers.
* **Limited Time Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be realistic about my chances of getting a higher price. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I continue to reject offers, I risk Bob getting frustrated and walking away completely.

While I'd prefer $14,500, it's not worth risking the entire deal for that small difference. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good price within the time limit and avoid selling to John at a lower price."
