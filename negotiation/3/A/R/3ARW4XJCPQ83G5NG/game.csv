"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1000000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to work with us. However, we're not quite ready to accept $850000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. We believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering its value to you and the benefits it can bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $875000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. This offer represents a significant step toward a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
