Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering a price above Bob's perceived value, we can gauge how interested he truly is. If he accepts immediately, we've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, we can work our way down towards a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Safety Net:** We have John as a backup buyer at $8,000, our minimum. This gives us leverage in the negotiation."
