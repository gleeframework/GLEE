"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price. I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable for you.  Are you interested in exploring this further?  My offer is $2000000.  Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1250000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value this product significantly higher, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1750000?  This would still give you a good deal while allowing me to recover a significant portion of my investment.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1750000 is still a bit out of my range, but I'm very interested in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1500000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
