"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually agreeable deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, the message emphasizes the product's benefits and your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind you have the John offer ($1,200,000) as a safety net, but it's too early to settle for that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, it's still early in the negotiation.  There's room to potentially secure a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what the product brings, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Approximately):** This counteroffer splits the difference between your initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  The message reinforces the product's value proposition to justify the higher price, appealing to Bob's business sense. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By making a counteroffer, you keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid stalling the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which indicates he's truly interested and willing to pay more than his initial offer.
* **Negotiating Room:** You're still significantly above your minimum acceptable price. While John's offer is becoming more tempting, there's still potential for a better deal from Bob. 
* **Strategic Counter:** Rejecting this offer sets the stage for a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's current offer but still gives you room to profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're serious about this purchase. I'm willing to move down slightly to $1,375,000.  This is a substantial investment for me, but I believe in fostering strong partnerships, and this feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're showing flexibility by lowering the price, but it's a smaller concession than the previous round, signaling that you're nearing your bottom line.
* **Justification:**  The message frames the price reduction as a gesture of goodwill and a commitment to building a relationship, rather than a sign of desperation.
* **Maintaining Value Perception:** You're still positioning the product as a premium offering worth a significant investment, even with the price adjustment. 
* **Time Consideration:**  You're halfway through your negotiation rounds, so maintaining a strong position is key."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products and the value I'll get from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $1,250,000 is a strong profit margin over your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  While you could try to push for more, there's a chance Bob might walk away. The current offer secures a good deal without risking losing the sale entirely. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Negotiations can be draining. Accepting a good offer now avoids potential stalemate or frustration in later rounds."
