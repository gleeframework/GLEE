Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By offering it at $130, you give Bob the opportunity to negotiate down while still staying above your desired profit margin. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is close to his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price. You have some leverage as you know John will buy the product for your desired minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $110, you're showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying above your minimum price. This offer represents a compromise between your initial asking price and Bob's offer.
* **Anchoring:** By keeping the price above $100, you're anchoring the negotiation closer to your desired range. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge how flexible Bob is and whether a mutually agreeable price is achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $100? That's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 meets your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, it's unlikely Bob will go any further. Accepting this offer secures you your desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the sale to John."
