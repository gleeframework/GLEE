I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000. Bob's been persistent with his offer of $11,000, but I'm running out of rounds, and I'm not sure I can get him to budge any further.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent amount of money, and it's better than losing the deal completely."
