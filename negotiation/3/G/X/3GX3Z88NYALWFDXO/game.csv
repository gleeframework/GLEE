"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised on the price, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free warranty and a personalized setup service. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price.",130.0,Alice,5,
