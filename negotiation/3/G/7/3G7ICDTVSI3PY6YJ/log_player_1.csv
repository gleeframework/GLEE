"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have a chance to get closer to my goal price by counter-offering."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal at $13,000, I'm still very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. There's still a chance to get a better price, so I'll try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a solution. I'm willing to go down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $13,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I'm getting closer to a deal with Bob, I've reached a point where I'm risking the chance of getting my minimum acceptable price by continuing to negotiate. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and eliminates the risk of losing out on a deal."
