"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $1,450,000, which is still within your budget.
* However, you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John.
* Since rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate with John or find a better price elsewhere, it's the most strategic option in this scenario."
