Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance to make a deal with Bob.  

**Strategy**

Aim high, but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. A price slightly below his maximum valuation encourages a quick ""yes.""

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the exclusivity and value of the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is a significant profit margin for you while still saving Bob $50,000 off his perceived value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""fair deal"" and ""significant benefits"" helps Bob rationalize accepting the offer. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might try to negotiate a lower price. Be prepared to walk away if his counteroffer falls below your acceptable range."
