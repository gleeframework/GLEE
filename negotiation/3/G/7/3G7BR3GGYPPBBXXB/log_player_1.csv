Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  This price reflects the product's quality and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the product's potential value to Bob. It avoids being too pushy or giving away too much information about your minimum value. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:** This gives you more room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Frame it positively:**  Focusing on the product's value to Bob helps him see the benefit of buying it.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:**  By not revealing your minimum, you maintain control and allow for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly your minimum price.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get more, and you risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting his offer ensures you get your minimum desired value and avoids the potential for further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a failed sale."
