(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still way above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, recognizing the value you see in the product. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and represents a fair compromise.  Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since we have 7 rounds left. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this deal. While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. To finalize this, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits us both. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still $300,000 higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I have a few rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  I'll make one final counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too much. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  We're both getting closer to an agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're pushing your limits, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and it's a price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen and finalize the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still higher than my maximum budget. With only 3 rounds left, the chance of negotiating further is slim, and there's a risk of the deal falling apart.  Since I can secure the product from John for $800,000, it's the safest and most cost-effective option at this point."
