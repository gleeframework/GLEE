{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You're leaving room for negotiation without risking selling below your minimum.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob understands exactly what you're offering. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,500 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $9,250?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
``` 
This counteroffer is a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my original offer.  It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for less than $9,000. I'm going to counter his offer again and see if we can reach a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,875, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering a slight concession, but still holding firm on my goal of reaching at least $9,000.  I'm hoping this final counteroffer will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $8,750. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Would you be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's a much better deal for me, and I'm confident John will be a happy customer."
