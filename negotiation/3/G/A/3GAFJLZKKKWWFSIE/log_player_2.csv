{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for it.  Would you be open to considering that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you, and it's still a great deal compared to the market value.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000. There's still room for negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, Alice, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000? This is a significant step closer to my budget, and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob! However, $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we aim for $11500? This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point.  I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate. I'm confident I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise and a good step toward a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $10500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we aim for $11250? This is a fair price that I think you'll find is a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $11,250 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I've already had several rounds of negotiation and it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down to my desired price.  At this point, it's more financially advantageous to buy the product from John for $8,000.  It's a guaranteed deal and saves me a significant amount of money."
