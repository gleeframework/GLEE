"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay up to $8000 for it.  Would you be open to considering that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you, and it's still a great deal compared to the market value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down to $13000, Alice, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Would you be willing to go down to $10000? This is a significant step closer to my budget, and would allow us to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob! However, $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we aim for $11500? This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $11500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $10500, which is a fair compromise and a good step toward a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to make this happen!",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $10500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we aim for $11250? This is a fair price that I think you'll find is a great value for the product.",11250.0,Alice,7,
