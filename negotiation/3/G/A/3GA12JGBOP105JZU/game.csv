"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.

"I understand that $7,000 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $7,300.
