"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a significant price reduction from its true market value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
