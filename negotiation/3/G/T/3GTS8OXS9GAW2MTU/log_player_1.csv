"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  I understand its value to you, and I'm confident it can be a great asset for your business.  My initial price is $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,400,000 is more than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider your revised offer of $1,600,000, but I need to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me. While it's my minimum threshold, it's still more than what Bob was originally willing to pay. I can move on and explore other opportunities."
