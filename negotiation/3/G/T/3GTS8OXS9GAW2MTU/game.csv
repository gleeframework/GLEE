"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  I understand its value to you, and I'm confident it can be a great asset for your business.  My initial price is $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider your revised offer of $1,600,000, but I need to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
