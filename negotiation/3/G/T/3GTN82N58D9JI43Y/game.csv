"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still allows me to make a profit while being fair to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I'm still hesitant to go below $1200000. It's my minimum, and I'm confident the product is worth it. I'm willing to go down to $1220000 as a final offer.  This way we can both come away feeling like we got a good deal. ",1220000.0,Alice,5,
