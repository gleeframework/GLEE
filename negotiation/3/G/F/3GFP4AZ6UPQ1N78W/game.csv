"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product, worth no less than $1,500,000 to me.  I'm confident it will be of great value to you as well.  To begin, I'm offering it for $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,600,000? It's a compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
