"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is above your maximum price. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a nice product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for her to make a profit. By being polite and expressing interest in the product, you increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting you closer to the middle, and this offer is below your maximum price.  There's no guarantee you could negotiate further down, and going to John would mean paying more."
