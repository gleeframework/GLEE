"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to be careful with my expenses. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,6,
