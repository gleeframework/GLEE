"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value, I'm initially offering it for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your absolute minimum. This gives you room to negotiate downwards while still potentially securing a price significantly above your baseline.
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This first offer allows me to understand how eager Bob is to purchase. His response (acceptance, a strong counter, or a weak counter) will give me a better sense of his perceived value and how I should proceed in future rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. I won't feel pressured to accept low offers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both my minimum and his stated value of the product. Accepting this would be a substantial loss.  I'll proceed to the next round and propose a counteroffer closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product. To move this forward, I can offer it for $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my initial price by $150,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, the new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This emphasizes the value of the product and aims to bring him closer to my range.
* **Time Consideration:**  With several rounds left, I have room to continue negotiating. A larger concession at this stage could weaken my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is a significant profit above my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  His suggestion of ""meeting in the middle"" indicates a willingness to compromise and potentially close the deal. 
* **Time Value:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob would agree, and I risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures a very good profit."
