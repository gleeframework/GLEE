"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm going to offer it to you for $975000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",975000.0,Alice,7,
