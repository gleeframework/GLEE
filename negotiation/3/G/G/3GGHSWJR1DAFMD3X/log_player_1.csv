Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs.  While my asking price is $1,150,000, I'm open to serious offers.  What would you consider a fair starting point for negotiations?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation is important, I don't want to anchor the negotiation too close to his perceived value. By starting with a price closer to my own minimum, I leave room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a higher profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states I'm ""open to serious offers."" This signals flexibility and invites Bob to engage in a dialogue where we can potentially find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value for someone with your needs,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth without directly revealing that I have a guaranteed buyer.

This approach aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the initial offer or counter with a price significantly higher than $800,000. 
2. **Leave room for negotiation:**  The strategy keeps the door open for a deal that's profitable for both parties, avoiding a scenario where Bob immediately walks away.
3. **Maintain a strong position:** By not drastically underselling the product, I maintain a position of strength throughout the negotiation. 
 
Ultimately, even if Bob rejects the initial offer, having him propose a counter-offer gives me valuable information for the negotiation. I know John will buy the product for my minimum, so any amount above $1,200,000 is pure profit."
