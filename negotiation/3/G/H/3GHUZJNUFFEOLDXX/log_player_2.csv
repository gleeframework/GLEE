"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. It's below her own valuation, indicating a willingness to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target a price significantly below Alice's valuation:** This leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a price well below my $1,500,000 maximum.
* **Maintain a polite and professional tone:**  This encourages a collaborative negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $900,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a middle ground, but the price is still above the halfway point between our initial offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. To be fair, your initial offer was closer to a reasonable price.  How about we settle at $975,000?"", ""product_price"": 975000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her current offer ($1,050,000) and my previous offer ($900,000), demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that Alice's initial offer was closer to a fair price, I subtly nudge her towards accepting a price closer to my target range.
* **Maintaining politeness:**  Continuing with a respectful and collaborative tone is important for a positive negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $975,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing $1,075,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not negotiating in good faith. Her counteroffer of $1,075,000 is actually *higher* than her previous offer of $1,050,000. This suggests she is unlikely to move significantly closer to my desired price range. 

It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $1,500,000. While not ideal, it's better than getting stuck in a dead-end negotiation with Alice and potentially paying even more than John's price."
