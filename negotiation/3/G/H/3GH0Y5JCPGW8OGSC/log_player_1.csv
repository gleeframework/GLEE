"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if needed. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price of $12,000. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $8,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, as I have 6 rounds left. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to stay within your budget, and I respect that. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,750? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and while I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, we're not reaching a price that meets my minimum requirement.  I have 4 rounds left, but I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.  I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $12,000."
