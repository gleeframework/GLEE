"I'm willing to consider your product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's my final offer. Please consider it.",920000.0,Bob,6,
