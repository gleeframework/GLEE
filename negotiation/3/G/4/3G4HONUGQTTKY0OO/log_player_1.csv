Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get a better deal with a counteroffer. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, while still allowing me to receive a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $950,000, I'm still within reach of my target price. There's a good chance I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  Also, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,000,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not acceptable to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 as a final compromise.  This price represents a significant concession on my part and ensures both of us get a fair deal. Let's finalize this transaction and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob's offer of $980,000 is very close to my target price, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk further negotiation.  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,000,000, which is a safe and profitable outcome."
