Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price that is above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer, but also ensures I make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still above his perceived value.  I believe this is a fair price that gives us both room to negotiate, and keeps the possibility of a successful deal open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm confident I can get my full asking price from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, especially since his offers are steadily decreasing."
