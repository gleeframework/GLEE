"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle on $11,000? It's a competitive price for a product of this quality.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
