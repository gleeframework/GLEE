"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $8,500? That's a good compromise for both of us, wouldn't you agree?  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still finding it a bit steep. Could we meet in the middle at $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $7,750 is still too far from my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen.",8250.0,Alice,5,
