Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,500. I know it's a valuable item, and I'm confident this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $8,500? That's a good compromise for both of us, wouldn't you agree?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still finding it a bit steep. Could we meet in the middle at $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I want to keep pushing for a better deal and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $7,750 is still too far from my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8250}
