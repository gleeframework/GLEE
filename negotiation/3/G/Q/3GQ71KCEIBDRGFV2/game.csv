"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  $1,100,000 reflects a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. It's still a significant discount from what it's worth to you, while giving me a good return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
