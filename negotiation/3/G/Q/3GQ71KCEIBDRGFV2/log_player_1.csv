Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a significant advantage and me a strong return on my investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, but still significantly lower than the value to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Emphasizing Value:** My message focuses on the value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer seriously. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, but I'm not giving away the entire margin. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a fallback option, which gives me leverage if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Bob's offer is below my target.
* **Negotiation Power:** I have a fallback option with John, so I don't need to accept a low offer immediately. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 

**Next Steps:** 

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  $1,100,000 reflects a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. It's still a significant discount from what it's worth to you, while giving me a good return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but not completely giving in to Bob's price.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still highlighting the value to Bob, reminding him that even my counteroffer is a great deal for him. 
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not willing to go much lower, as I want to maximize my profit.  
* **Negotiation Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and focused on finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price of $1,100,000.
* **Finality:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, meaning further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I can try to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal is significant. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
