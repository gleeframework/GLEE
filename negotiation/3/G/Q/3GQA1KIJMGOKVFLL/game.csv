"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130?  That's still a good price for this great product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $122 is just too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $128. This is a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. What do you say?",128.0,Alice,5,
