Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is too far below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,750?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.
