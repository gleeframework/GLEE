Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500.
* This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but lower than the value Bob places on the product ($12,000).
* This gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can sell the product to John for $10,000, which is still a good outcome."
