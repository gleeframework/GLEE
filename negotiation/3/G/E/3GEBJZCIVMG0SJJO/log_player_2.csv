"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $14,000 is higher than Alice's value ($10,000), it's still less than your maximum price of $15,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
