"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is still a significant amount.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
