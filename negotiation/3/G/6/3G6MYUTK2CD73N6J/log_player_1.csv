Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $175 offers a decent markup from your minimum while still being potentially attractive to Bob, considering the product's value to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a single offer scenario, starting a bit higher leaves you room to potentially negotiate down if Bob hesitates,  getting closer to $150 if needed."
