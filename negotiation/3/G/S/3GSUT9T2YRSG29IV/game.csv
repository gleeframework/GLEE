"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is significantly over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $17000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17000 is still out of my range. I'm firm on my offer of $10000.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer it to you for $14000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $14000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm sticking to my offer of $10000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay. It's now your turn to decide - if you want to sell, this is the price. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere.",10000.0,Bob,6,
