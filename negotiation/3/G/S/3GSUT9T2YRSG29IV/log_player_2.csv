Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $17000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer it to you for $14000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

It's now your turn to decide - if you want to sell, this is the price. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 10000}
