"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit margin. If Bob rejects, I can always adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or move on to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John if I don't get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum and I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I've got time and I can always sell to John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit more, but I'm still holding firm on getting at least $16,000. It's getting close to my minimum, but I think I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. I've only got 4 rounds left, but I'm not desperate. I have a backup option in John. There's a chance Bob will raise his offer or I might be able to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer at $14,000. It's only $1,000 above Bob's last offer, but it's also a fair bit closer to my desired price. With only three rounds left, I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum.  With only two rounds left, it's unlikely that I'll be able to get a better price from Bob. I'm going to sell to John and get $15,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than what Bob is offering."
