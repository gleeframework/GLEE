"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity to gain a valuable asset at a price that's significantly below its true worth.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
