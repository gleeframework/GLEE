"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This price still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
