"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $95. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while maintaining a decent profit margin."
