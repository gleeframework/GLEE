"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he's not, I'll move on to John, but I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my desired price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my goal. I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay, and I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer but staying above Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and reach a mutually agreeable price.  If Bob rejects again, I'll need to reconsider my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial goal, it's a significant improvement from his first offer, and I'm confident I won't get a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's important to be realistic and secure a good price, rather than risking losing the deal altogether."
