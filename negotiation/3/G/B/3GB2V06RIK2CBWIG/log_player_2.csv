# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,450,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $1,450,000 is higher than Alice's valuation, it's still less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000."
