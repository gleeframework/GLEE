"I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to negotiate hard, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go below $140. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to wait for a better offer. How about we meet at $137.50? That's the lowest I can go.",137.5,Alice,5,
