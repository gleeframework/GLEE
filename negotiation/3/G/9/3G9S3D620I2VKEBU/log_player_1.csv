{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($150) but still within a range Bob might consider given the product is worth $100 to him.  I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the product's potential benefits for him.  This should hopefully encourage a counteroffer rather than an outright rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a little higher.  If he's truly interested, he might be willing to budge a bit more."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $135?  It's a small step closer to what I need, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This round is getting frustrating. Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but they're still too low for me. I'm worried that if I keep going back and forth, he'll eventually walk away.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150. That's a guaranteed sale that's closer to my desired price."
