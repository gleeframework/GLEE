Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14000} 

I'm starting with a price that is close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise while ensuring I don't immediately sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my target price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from my previous offer, aiming to meet halfway with Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made multiple concessions. At this point, it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for a guaranteed $15,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob."
