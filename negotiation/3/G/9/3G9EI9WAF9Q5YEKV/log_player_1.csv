Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, securing a healthy profit.
* **Avoids Risk:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob withdrawing his interest. Accepting now guarantees the sale.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner allows me to reinvest the earnings earlier."
