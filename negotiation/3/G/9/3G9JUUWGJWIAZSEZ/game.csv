"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $600,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. This is my best offer at the moment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I really need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,000,000 to $700,000, which would be $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",850000.0,Alice,5,
