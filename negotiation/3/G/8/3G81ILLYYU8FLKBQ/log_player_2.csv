"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate.  I'm asking for $150, given its quality and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $150 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is quite low.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4

""message"": ""It seems we're getting closer, Alice. How about $95?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I can't let it go for less than $115. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $115. While we might be able to negotiate a slightly better price, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her ""final offer.""  John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which is a better deal at this point."
