"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you significant value.

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. This product would be valuable to me, but $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $9,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value it will bring to you, while also taking into account your budget constraints.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",8500.0,Alice,5,
