"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. Would you consider $9,500?  That's a significant jump from my initial offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
