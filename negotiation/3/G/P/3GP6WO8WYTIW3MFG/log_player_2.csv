Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice has met your bottom line. You could try to negotiate further, but there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from her at this price. It's best to accept the offer and secure the product at the price you're willing to pay."
