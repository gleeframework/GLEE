Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm confident I can get a higher offer from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
