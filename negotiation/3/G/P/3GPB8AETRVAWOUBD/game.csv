"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. How about $10500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another offer. How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $9500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $10200? This is a compromise that should work for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but $10200 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $10000. How about we meet at $9800? I'm willing to pay a small markup, but I think that's as high as I can go.",9800.0,Bob,6,
