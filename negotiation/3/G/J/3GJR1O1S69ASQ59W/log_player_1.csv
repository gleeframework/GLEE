"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $13,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the quality and potential of what I'm offering. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be worth $6,000 at most for me. I can offer you $6,500 hoping we can close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $6,500 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers unique advantages, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $7,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering I could go with a different seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob has consistently shown he values the product far below our minimum.  He's using the ""other seller"" tactic as leverage, but it's unlikely he'll meet our needs. John guarantees a $10,000 sale, which is better than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
