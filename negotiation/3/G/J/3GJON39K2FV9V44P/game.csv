"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $22,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be open to considering that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however,  $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you won't find a better product at this price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",15000.0,Bob,4,
