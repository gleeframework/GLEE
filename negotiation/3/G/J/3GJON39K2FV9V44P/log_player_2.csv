Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $22,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be open to considering that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however,  $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you won't find a better product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 15000}
