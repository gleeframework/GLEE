{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $11,500 is the right price for the product. I'm willing to pay $11,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250

``` 
At this point, it's likely that Bob is very close to his maximum price. Rejecting his offer would leave you with very few rounds left, and there's no guarantee that he'll increase his offer again. Accepting his offer of $11,250 is the best choice, as it's a higher price than John's offer, and there's no guarantee that you'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
