Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,150,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **I still have room to negotiate.** I have 8 rounds left, and Bob has shown interest in the product.
* **Selling to John is a fallback option.** While it's a guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm hoping to get closer to Bob's valuation of $1,200,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal. I'm confident you'll find this a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider a fair compromise.
* **I still have time to negotiate.** I have 6 rounds left and Bob is clearly interested in the product.
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm aiming higher.** I believe I can get closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  I'm confident you'll see this as a good opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for staying with me on this.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to.  How about $1,000,000 even? That would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price.**  It's not ideal, but it's a good outcome considering the negotiation.
* **I've already reached my fallback option.** Selling to John would give me the same price as Bob's current offer.
* **There's no guarantee of a better deal.**  I have 4 rounds left, but there's no assurance Bob will increase his offer further. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 without the risk of losing the deal."
