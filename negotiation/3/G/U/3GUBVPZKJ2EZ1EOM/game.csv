"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is lower than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is a fair price that's within my budget and allows us to close the deal. Let's work together to find a solution.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
