"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a great value considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
