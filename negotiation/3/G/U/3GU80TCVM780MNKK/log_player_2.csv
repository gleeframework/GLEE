"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a great value considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high. While her message implies a single take-it-or-leave-it offer, it's generally better to negotiate in these scenarios. I'll aim for a price closer to her value of $800,000 while keeping in mind my walk-away alternative of buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $850,000 is still a significant markup from her $800,000 value. I'll continue negotiating, trying to inch closer to a price around $750,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

While not ideal, $825,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly less than my maximum budget and John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away, risking losing the deal altogether."
