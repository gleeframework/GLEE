"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $825000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $750000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $750000 is the best price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $810000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $810000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $780000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $780000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $820000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",820000.0,Alice,7,
