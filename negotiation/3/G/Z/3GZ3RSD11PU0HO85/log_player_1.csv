Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $17,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get at least $15,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $16,000. This is a compromise,  meeting him halfway between his offer and my initial offer. I'm hopeful he'll accept this price, as it's still more than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $14,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my initial goal.  I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and am not sure I can get Bob to go higher.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price, it's more prudent to sell the product to him and avoid further risk and negotiation."
