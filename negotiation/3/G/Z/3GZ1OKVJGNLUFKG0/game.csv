"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique item with significant potential.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,600,000 undervalues the unique aspects of this product.  Would you consider $1,850,000? This reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your initial interest.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a revised offer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also considering my budget constraints.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
