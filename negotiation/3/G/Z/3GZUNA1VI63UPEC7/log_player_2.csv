"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's not even close to the $12,000 she values it at. Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiating and potentially get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000. This is a strong opening position and shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but also that I won't go above my limit.  It's also a price that's fair to both of us, given her valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my ideal price of $10,000. There is still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows me to explore those possibilities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $11,000, showing flexibility and willingness to meet halfway. This is still below Alice's current offer and within my budget. It's a good compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, though it's getting closer. However, with only 5 rounds left, the risk of not getting a better deal outweighs the potential savings.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal.  $11,500 is a compromise between my last offer and her current one. It's still within my budget, and it's more likely to be accepted than my previous offer. With only 4 rounds left, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at her valuation of the product.  While tempting, with only 3 rounds left, it's still higher than my desired price. There's still a chance to get closer to my budget, and I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll continue negotiating, but with only 3 rounds left, I'll need to be more aggressive in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $11,800. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to come closer to Alice's valuation. However, it's still below her current offer, and it's also within my budget. With only two rounds left, I need to make a strong push to secure a deal. This offer is a good compromise that could potentially convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Alice's final offer, and it's now just $900 above my target price.  With only one round left, it's a good time to accept and close the deal. It's a small price to pay for securing the product, especially since I'm still getting a discount from her initial offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of not closing the deal outweighs the potential savings."
