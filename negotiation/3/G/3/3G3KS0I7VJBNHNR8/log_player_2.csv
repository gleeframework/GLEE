(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $90 is above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Therefore, it's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my price range.  Would you be willing to consider $75?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise at $82. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price point of $80.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can aim for a price even closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $80? That's my absolute maximum, but I'm truly interested in getting this product."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. I can offer you a deal at $81. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $81 is very close to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still above his target price.  He has 5 rounds remaining, but there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer.  Since John is offering the product for $80, the best option for Bob is to secure the deal with John and avoid further negotiation."
