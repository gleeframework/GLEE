"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your consideration and counter-offer. While $900,000 is certainly appealing, I believe this product's true value is significantly higher. I could consider a price of $1,050,000. This reflects a willingness to compromise while still recognizing the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
