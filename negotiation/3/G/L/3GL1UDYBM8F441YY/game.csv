"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to me is even higher. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm quite interested in the product, but that price is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the value you place on the product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,125?  This would be a fair compromise and I think it's a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10125.0,Alice,5,
