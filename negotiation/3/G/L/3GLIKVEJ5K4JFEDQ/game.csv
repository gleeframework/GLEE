"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'll find very valuable. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,250?  This price still allows me to cover my costs and leaves some room for negotiation.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. Let me know what you think.",9750.0,Bob,4,
