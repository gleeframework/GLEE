"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  It's best to try to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
