"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. I believe this price reflects its worth while still making it a good deal for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant compromise. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to go with another vendor if we can't find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
