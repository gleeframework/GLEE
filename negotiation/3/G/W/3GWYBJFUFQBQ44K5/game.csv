"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $7,500 for it. This price still gives you a good profit margin, and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is still a good price for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair profit for me. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $7,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement quickly. Let's see if we can make this happen.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
