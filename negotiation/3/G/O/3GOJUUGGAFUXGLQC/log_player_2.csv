"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price. What do you think about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering the product for $115.  While it's a good deal, you can still get it cheaper from John for $120.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $5."
