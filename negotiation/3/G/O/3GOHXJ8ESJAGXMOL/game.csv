"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while also allowing me to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
