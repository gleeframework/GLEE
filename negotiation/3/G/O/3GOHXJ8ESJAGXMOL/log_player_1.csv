{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from the value he places on the product, while still being a significant profit for you. It's a starting point for negotiation, and allows room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while also allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the value I place on the product ($1,500,000) and  the initial offer I made. I will try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
