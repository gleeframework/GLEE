Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to sell below that price. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering the product at your minimum acceptable price sets a strong anchor for the negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to pay slightly more if he perceives its value or is in need of it urgently. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no time constraints or costs associated with waiting for John to purchase the product. If there were time pressures, you might consider a slightly lower price to increase the chances of a quicker sale to Bob."
