Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with the highest possible price, knowing that Bob values it lower. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer positively and emphasizing the value Bob will get, hoping to encourage him to consider it. 

**Strategy:** 
My goal is to maximize profit. This starting offer sets the stage for potential negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can then consider lowering the price slightly or exploring counteroffers.  However, I have the option to sell to John for $100, which provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? I appreciate your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  While $85 is tempting,  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your business, $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95 to make this deal work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering the price to $95, a compromise that shows flexibility but still keeps me above my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while maintaining my position. I'm trying to find a middle ground that will be acceptable to both of us.

**Strategy:** 
This counteroffer  signals that I'm open to negotiation but not willing to give up too much. It allows for a potential deal at a price that is closer to my goal while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe we can find a middle ground. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is still slightly below my desired price, it is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate risks prolonging the process and potentially leading to a stalemate.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $100, accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit. It's a good compromise considering the risk of Bob walking away."
