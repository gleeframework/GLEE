"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $85 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
