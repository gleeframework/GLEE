This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a profit.  It's also friendly and inviting, setting a positive tone for the interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135? It's still a great price for this product, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 135}
