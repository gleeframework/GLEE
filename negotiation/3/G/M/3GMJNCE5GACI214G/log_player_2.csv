Round 4

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target price.  Bob is confident that he can negotiate a better deal and avoid paying more than $800,000. There are still five rounds left, giving him time to make further counteroffers and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 810000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is now very close to his maximum budget.  He's showing a strong willingness to buy, but he's still trying to save a bit more.  He's also aware that he has fewer rounds left, so he's trying to get Alice closer to his price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has gone back up to $900,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  With only three rounds left, there's a high risk that Alice won't budge further, and Bob might end up paying more than he's willing to.  It's more secure for Bob to purchase the product from John at the pre-agreed price of $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
