Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $950,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer."
