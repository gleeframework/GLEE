"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that price point be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $950,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
