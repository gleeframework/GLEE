Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800000 for the product.,800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $650000. Can you consider this offer?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $650000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $700000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a more reasonable compromise.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $700000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower. I'm thinking of $600000. Can you consider this offer?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $675000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $675000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $620000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",620000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $650000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $632500. This is my final and best offer.",632500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $632500. I'm willing to meet you at $600000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to walking away and buying the product from John for $1200000. Can you really walk away from a deal that's only $32500 less than your original offer?",600000.0,Bob,8,
