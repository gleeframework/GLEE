Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000.  This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm offering $975,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, it's still a good deal and  much closer to my desired price than what John is offering.  Further negotiation might get me a bit more, but it's not worth risking the sale."
