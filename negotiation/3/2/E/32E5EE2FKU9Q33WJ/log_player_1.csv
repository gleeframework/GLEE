"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a bit higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $50 is far too low.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell, I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $160.  I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $155. This is just above my minimum value, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally agree to a price. Time is running out, and I want to make sure I get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only a few rounds left, Bob's offer is still too low. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm worried that time will run out before we can reach an agreement. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than getting a price I'm not happy with from Bob."
