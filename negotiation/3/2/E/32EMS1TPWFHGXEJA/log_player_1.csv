"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $9,500 is a good strategic move at this point:

* **Profitable:** $9,500 is still a significant profit margin over my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Saves Time:** Continuing negotiations could be lengthy with no guarantee of a much better outcome.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's always a risk Bob could walk away, leaving me to sell to John for $10,000. Accepting secures the profit now."
