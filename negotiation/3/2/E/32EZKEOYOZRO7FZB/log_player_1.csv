Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $1,250,000 is a reasonable starting point that might entice Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly states that I am open to negotiation, keeping the door open for counteroffers. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept it (if it's close to my minimum) or make a counter-counteroffer. 
* If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll proceed with selling to John to ensure I get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob's offer is better than nothing, I believe there's still room for negotiation. He clearly sees value in the product, and I can likely get closer to my desired price.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price. However, I want to maximize my profits. By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll need to be strategic in my counteroffer, considering the fact that Bob has a budget constraint."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $1,100,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $1,250,000 to $1,300,000, showing willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still far above Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product, reminding Bob of its worth and justifying my higher price.
* **Focusing on a mutually beneficial transaction:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win situation, appealing to Bob's rationality.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response and potentially make further concessions, depending on his counteroffer. 
* If Bob continues to offer low prices, I will consider selling to John to guarantee my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. This amount still adheres to my budget while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely or that further negotiation will take too long. 
* **Securing a profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit, which is important.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
