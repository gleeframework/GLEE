Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm interested in selling, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not meeting my minimum threshold. It's important to remember that John is offering a guaranteed sale at a price that aligns with my minimum value.  I can't risk further negotiation with Bob, as I may not reach a better deal, and I risk losing time and potentially losing John's offer."
