"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower. How about we settle on $10,500?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go down to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a reasonable price for the product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
