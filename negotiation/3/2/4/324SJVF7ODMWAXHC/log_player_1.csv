"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm happy to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum threshold of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000.  I'm also using a friendly tone to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below the midpoint between our minimum ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($15,000). There's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower. How about we settle on $10,500?  That's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Since we have several rounds left, I don't want to settle for an offer that's significantly below what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go down to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a reasonable price for the product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
