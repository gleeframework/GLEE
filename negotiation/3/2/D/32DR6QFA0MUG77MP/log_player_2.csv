"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can always go to John, but it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great price for a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to your goal, it's still above your maximum. You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, so keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go down to $108, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're close to your target price, but still slightly above it. You can likely get Alice down to your desired price with one more counteroffer.  It's a good idea to try to close the deal with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $106.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $106 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $107. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to sell to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $107 is the closest she's come to your desired price and still leaves you some room for profit. It's risky to keep negotiating, as Alice might not be willing to go lower and you could end up buying from John at a higher price."
