Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm under pressure to close the deal, his offer is too far below my minimum. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  It's a good compromise and avoids the risk of losing the deal completely or having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
