"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $8500?  I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price is fair given the value I'm seeing in it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. However, $8500 is a little lower than I'd hoped for. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9250? I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $9250.  Would you consider $9000?  That's a good compromise for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",9000.0,Bob,4,
