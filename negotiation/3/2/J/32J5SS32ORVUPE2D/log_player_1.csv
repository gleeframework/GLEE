Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the worth:** I know Bob values the product at $15,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This gives me a strong starting point.
* **Aiming higher:** My goal is to maximize profit.  Starting at $20,000 leaves room for negotiation downwards while still securing a profit above my minimum. 
* **Clear and concise:**  The message is straightforward and emphasizes the product's value without revealing my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy allows me to potentially secure a higher price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines."
