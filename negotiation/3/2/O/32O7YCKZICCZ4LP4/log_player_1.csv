Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $140, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price Bob might accept, getting close to his maximum valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob could try to negotiate a lower price.
* **Staying Above Your Minimum:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, you're still likely to get a better price than John's $100 offer."
