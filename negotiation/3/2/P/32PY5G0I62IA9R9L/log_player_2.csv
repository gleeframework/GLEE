Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and the time and effort I've invested in it. What do you think?

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but she's holding firm above our ideal price point. We're at round 5, and she's unlikely to drop below $1,000,000.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the guaranteed price from John."
