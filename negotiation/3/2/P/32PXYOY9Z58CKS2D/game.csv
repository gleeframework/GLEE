"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you consider $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. I'm still looking for a price closer to $85, but I can go up to $95.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to work with.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit higher than your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $100. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  If you're willing to come down to $90, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with another seller.",90.0,Bob,6,
