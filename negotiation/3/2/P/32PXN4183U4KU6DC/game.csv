"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1300000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1100000.  Would you be willing to consider this offer? I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize this purchase.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000, which is my absolute minimum. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
