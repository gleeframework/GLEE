"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals Bob's strong desire to get a good deal.  $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and provides some room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to accept a price closer to this counteroffer if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price point. There's still room to bargain and potentially get a better deal without going over his maximum limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  $14,500 is still a good deal for Bob, keeping him under his budget and potentially enticing Alice to accept. It's a reasonable middle ground that shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also trying to get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 lower than her previous offer.  Bob has already made significant concessions and it seems unlikely Alice will come down further. While $16,000 is within Bob's budget,  buying from John for $15,000 is the more financially sound decision, ensuring Bob gets the best possible price and avoids further negotiation."
