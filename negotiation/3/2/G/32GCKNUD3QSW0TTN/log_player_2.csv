"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from its true value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  He wants to get it for under $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your desired selling price and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is too far below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere. Let's try to reach a compromise here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He can try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his target price. It's also worth noting that he's already halfway through his negotiation rounds, so there's not much time to lose."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my limited budget.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I have other potential buyers. Let's meet in the middle here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, but he's still aiming to get a better price. It's important for him to keep pushing for a lower price, as there's still some wiggle room. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price.  However, he's running out of rounds, so he needs to consider the risk of running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $850,000 is getting closer, but it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would give you a significant profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget. It's a win-win situation. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
