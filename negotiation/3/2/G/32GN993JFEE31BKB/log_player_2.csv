"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is within your budget, it's not the best deal. You want to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  $85 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $90. 
* **Value gap:**  This counteroffer still leaves some room for negotiation, as the product is worth $80 to Alice.
* **Strategic advantage:**  By making a counteroffer, you establish yourself as a savvy buyer and potentially push Alice to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider 87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $87.50 is still a good deal for you, as it's within your budget and significantly lower than John's price.
* **Negotiation progress:**  While you could try to push for a lower price, the negotiation has already progressed well. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer again.
* **Time:**  You have a limited number of rounds, and continuing to negotiate could lead to you running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price."
