"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $90? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $95?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",95.0,Bob,4,
