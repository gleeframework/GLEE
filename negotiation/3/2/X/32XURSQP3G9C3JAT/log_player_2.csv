"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely do better than $1,000,000.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's room to negotiate. You have 10 rounds and the option of buying from John, so you're in a good position to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for compromise and allows for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from her initial offer, but it's still not a price that maximizes your savings. You are still in a strong position with the ability to make counteroffers and the option to buy from John. There's likely room for Alice to come down further, especially since she rejected your counteroffer in the previous round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price. It's important to be persistent without making unreasonable demands, as you want to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to your desired price range, but $1,075,000 is still too high. You have several rounds left, and the threat of buying from John keeps you in a strong bargaining position. By continuing to reject and counter-offer, you might be able to squeeze a few more thousand dollars out of Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than what you believe is fair. You're showing you're willing to compromise but are pushing for a better price. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and puts pressure on Alice to accept your offer before you decide to purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You've already rejected several offers and have successfully pushed her price lower. While the pressure is mounting as you're nearing the halfway point of your rounds, you still have the leverage of John's offer to fall back on.  Continue negotiating, and you might get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has continued to move slightly closer to your target price, but she's still hesitant to meet your desired price.  You've made it clear you're serious about buying, but also willing to walk away. This counteroffer signals that you're prepared to meet her halfway but won't budge further. It's a strong negotiating tactic to force a decision from Alice. If she rejects this offer, you're likely closer to deciding to purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've reached a crucial point in the negotiation.  While Alice has lowered her price significantly, you've only got one round left.  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a price lower than $1,075,000 in a single round, and at that point, you'd be better off buying from John.  While it's not your ideal price, buying from John guarantees you'll acquire the product, which might be more important than saving a few extra dollars."
