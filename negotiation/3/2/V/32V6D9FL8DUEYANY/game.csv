"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $200 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $170. This is my final offer.",170.0,Alice,3,

I understand that $170 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider meeting me at this price?,140.0,Bob,4,
