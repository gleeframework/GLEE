{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial ""discount"" if he values it for other reasons (e.g., strategic importance).
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept even if he finds the price a bit high.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, Alice might need to adjust her offer."
