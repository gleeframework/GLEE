"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too far below my value.  How about we meet at $1,500,000? This price is fair for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. ",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm open to reaching a deal, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs.  Let's make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
