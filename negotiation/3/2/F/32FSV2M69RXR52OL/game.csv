"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but your price is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is fair given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product to me and your profit margin. Let's try to find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
