Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us. This makes it more appealing and encourages Bob to consider the deal.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to secure a good price while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and respond accordingly, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our desired prices. This keeps the negotiation alive and potentially leads to a more favorable outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $900,000, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's still above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's concerns about budget while emphasizing the potential benefits for both of us with this price. This approach aims to create a collaborative tone and encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between pushing for a better price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. By showing willingness to compromise, I aim to find a deal that meets my minimum requirements while also leaving a positive impression on Bob. This strategy helps me avoid losing the deal while staying close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I am willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk selling the product for less than what it's worth to me. 

**Strategy:**

Selling to John ensures that I get my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could potentially lead to a lower price. 

This decision is based on the following factors:

* **My Minimum Price:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to buy the product for $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is below my minimum price.

Therefore, selling to John is the most favorable option in this situation."
