"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I've assessed its worth and believe a price of $1,000,000 is fair, reflecting its significant value to both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 still falls short of my minimum expectation. Given the product's worth to you and the potential benefits it offers, I believe $950,000 represents a fair compromise. This price reflects the significant value we both stand to gain from this transaction.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. It's worth continuing to negotiate.  Bob still has some room to bargain and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This would be a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
