"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13750?  I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $13750 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12500, so how about $13375?",13375.0,Bob,4,
