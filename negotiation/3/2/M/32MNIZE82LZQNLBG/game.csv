"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $950,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
