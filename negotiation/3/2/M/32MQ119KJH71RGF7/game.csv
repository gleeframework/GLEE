I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. What do you think?,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my offer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to get closer to your desired price, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $1050000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1100000, which would be $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1075000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1025000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1075000, but I'll meet you in the middle between $1025000 and $1075000, which would be $1050000. I'm willing to compromise at this price, but I'm not going any lower. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1050000, which would be $1025000, but I'd rather not go any higher. Can you consider this price?",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a stalemate, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1150000, which is a compromise between my original offer and your counteroffer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1025000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. Can you reconsider?",1025000.0,Bob,10,
