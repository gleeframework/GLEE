Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping to get as close to that $10,000 as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my initial asking price, and it's significantly more than my minimum value of $8,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
