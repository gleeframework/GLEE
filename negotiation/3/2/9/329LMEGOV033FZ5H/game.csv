"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I have another offer for $1,000,000. To make this work for me, I'd need you to come down significantly. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty. It seems like we're both aiming for a deal here. How about we settle at $1,200,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
