"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've started with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick agreement.  Starting slightly below my minimum allows me to potentially close the deal in the first round. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter-offer, but I'm also prepared to switch to John if the negotiation becomes too lengthy or Bob becomes too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150 at this point, especially since John is offering that amount. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.

**Strategy:**

I'm still aiming for a good price and will continue to negotiate with Bob.  However, I'm keeping John as my backup option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've moved halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** I'm staying positive and emphasizing the value of the product while still being firm about my price.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if the price doesn't meet my minimum requirements. I have six rounds left and am confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm not willing to sell for less than that. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that John is willing to pay my minimum price.  

**Strategy:**

I'll counter-offer again, aiming to meet Bob halfway and potentially reach an agreement. However, I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation drags on or if Bob doesn't come up to a reasonable price.  I have six rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. Let's split the difference this time. I'll offer you the product for $135. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $135, which is halfway between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130. This shows a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Message:** I'm staying positive and emphasizing that I want to make the deal work. I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

I believe this offer is a fair compromise and could lead to a quick agreement. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John.  I only have five rounds left, so the time is ticking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $135 is the best deal I can get. I was thinking more along the lines of $128. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $128 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price of $150.  We've been going back and forth for a while, and I don't want to risk losing John as a buyer.  I'm confident I can get my minimum price from John, and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

It's time to secure the deal.  John is offering my minimum, and the time constraint is growing. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired price."
