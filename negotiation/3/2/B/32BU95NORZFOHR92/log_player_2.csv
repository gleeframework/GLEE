Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $12,000, which is my minimum. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to explore other options.

Alice is unlikely to go below $12,000. It's better to cut my losses and go with John for $10,000."
