Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still too high. While it is lower than before, it's still above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I've already made several counteroffers and it seems like she's not willing to come down further.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $800,000.  It's within my budget and saves me a significant amount of money compared to what Alice is offering."
