"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer, as I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I want to try and see if I can negotiate higher than $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $7,500 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with some more negotiation, and I don't want to settle for too little."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.  Let's try $8,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
