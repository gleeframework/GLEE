"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is above my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, which might get her attention. However, it leaves room for further negotiation if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While closer to my budget, $9,500 is still more than I need to spend. I'll try to negotiate further, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a significant step from my initial offer and puts us closer to a deal."",

}
```

This counter-offer shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but also signals that I'm serious about staying within a specific budget."
