"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, I'm confident that this product can bring you significant value exceeding $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $13,500. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Bob.  While I see your point, the value this product offers is truly unique.  How about we settle at $16,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,500, so I'll offer $14,500. That's as high as I'm willing to go.",14500.0,Bob,6,
