Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  It's a fair price for a product that's clearly valuable to both of us.
