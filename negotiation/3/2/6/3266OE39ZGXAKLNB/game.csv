"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and it leaves room for us both to walk away happy.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,275,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
