Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and appear flexible if you need to lower your price later. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value to Bob, I'm trying to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum, leaving space for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  I haven't mentioned John yet.  It's my backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming to me first. However, $14,000 is a bit too steep for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $6,000 is far below both my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and his own perceived value ($8,000). Accepting would be a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a large gap between his offer and what I'm willing to accept. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **John as Leverage:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned John to Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 gives me a strong position to walk away from a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $6,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers you a lot of value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Counter:** By rejecting Bob's low offer and immediately countering, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but also standing firm on my desire for a fair price.
* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:** Dropping to $10,000 shows flexibility on my part but still keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Value Reminder:**  Reiterating the product's value to Bob reinforces the idea that a higher price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $10,000 is closer, I'm still a bit off.  How about $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, $7,500 is still significantly below my $12,000 minimum. Accepting would be a loss.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By continuing to reject offers below my minimum, I'm gauging how serious Bob is about purchasing the product. He might be willing to go higher if he really wants it.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John's offer in my back pocket gives me the confidence to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be transparent.  I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price. I'm willing to make one final offer to you because I think this product would be a good fit. Would you consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Urgency:** By mentioning another buyer (without revealing John's specific offer), I'm introducing a sense of urgency and scarcity. This could encourage Bob to make a more serious offer.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By framing this as my final offer, I'm setting a clear boundary and putting the decision in Bob's hands.
* **Compromise, but Above Minimum:** $9,000 represents a compromise on my part, but it's still above my absolute minimum, ensuring a profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Leaving Room for Acceptance/Rejection:** This offer gives Bob a final chance to consider a price closer to his perceived value while still allowing me to walk away and sell to John."
