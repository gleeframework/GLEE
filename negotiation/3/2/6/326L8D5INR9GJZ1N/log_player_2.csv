"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but I'm not sure I can go that high.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This is my best offer, given my budget constraints.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value this product brings to the table, particularly for someone like you, is immense. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,275,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is still higher than my target price of $1,500,000, but it's a good compromise.  It's also likely that if I reject this offer, Alice will not come down further, and I'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
