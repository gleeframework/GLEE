{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can do better than $11,500 since the product is worth $12,000 to him.  He has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price of $10,500. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. This is a strong opening counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round.  He's showing he's willing to compromise, but still trying to get a price closer to his desired target.  This offer leaves room for further negotiation while also showing a willingness to move towards a deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still higher than his desired price, it's close enough that he can afford to pay it.  He's only spending $900 more than his ideal price, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a longer process with no guarantee of a better outcome.  The risk of losing the deal to John at $12,000 is also significant."
