{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's valuation:**  $11,500 is below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him a potential incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still go higher if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

This strategy allows you to potentially get a better price without risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  It's still a good price for you, and it would be a great deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. 

Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500.
* **Minimizing risk:** Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't mean losing the deal. It allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price.

My counteroffer will be strategically crafted to increase the chances of a successful deal while staying above my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you want at a good value."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **Compromise:** It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Maintain Value:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum and closer to my ideal price of $11,500.
* **Reasonable Approach:**  Meeting in the middle with Bob makes the offer more appealing and increases the likelihood of an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $10,750? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. Here's why:

* **Close to my goal:**  $10,750 is closer to my desired price than John's offer, but I can still try to get a bit more.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I can potentially squeeze out a few more dollars.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting the offer doesn't mean losing the deal, and I can continue to bargain with Bob.

My next counteroffer will be strategic and carefully considered to maximize my profit while maintaining the possibility of a successful deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference and go with $10,875.  This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **Small Concession:** It shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still holding on to a significant portion of my desired profit. 
* **Appealing Number:** The $10,875 price is a midpoint between my previous offer and his, making it seem more reasonable.
* **Maintaining Value:**  The price is still above my minimum of $10,000 and relatively close to my ideal price.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** It sets the stage for a potential final agreement and avoids a drawn-out negotiation."
