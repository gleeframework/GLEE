"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. While Alice's offer is lower than Bob's maximum, it's still above Alice's minimum. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  It's still a good price for you, and it would be a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you want at a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better offer than $11,500, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Alice's minimum is $10,000, so there is still room for Bob to counter-offer at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $10,750? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference and go with $10,875.  This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a final agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, it's getting very close to Bob's maximum price. While a lower price is always ideal, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and forcing Bob to buy from John at $12,000 is high.  $10,875 is a good compromise that saves Bob $1,125 compared to buying from John."
