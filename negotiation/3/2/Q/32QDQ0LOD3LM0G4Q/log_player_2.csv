"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. 
* **Counteroffer potential:**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **No immediate risk:**  Rejecting Alice's offer doesn't mean you're stuck. You can always buy from John later if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $9,000 counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's $12,000, but it's still within your budget and might be acceptable to Alice considering her minimum acceptable price is $8,000.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for a potential compromise if Alice wants to make a counteroffer.
* **Prioritizes saving money:** By making a lower counteroffer, you increase your chances of getting a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her previous offer, $11,000 is still above your desired price range.
* **Counteroffer potential:** You have already made a counteroffer, and Alice is willing to negotiate. There's a good chance you can get her down further.
* **No immediate risk:** You're not losing anything by rejecting Alice's offer. You can always buy from John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's current offer of $11,000. 
* **Mid-point:** It offers a middle ground that might be appealing to both parties.
* **Reasonable for both sides:** While you are still saving money compared to John's price, this offer is likely acceptable to Alice, who is likely eager to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good price:** Alice's offer of $10,500 is within your budget and significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:** You have already made several counteroffers, and Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $10,500.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you keep rejecting Alice's offer, she might become frustrated and decide to sell the product to someone else. 

It's a good deal, and it's time to accept it to secure the product."
