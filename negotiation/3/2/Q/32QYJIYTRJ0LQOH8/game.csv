"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I place on it and gives us both a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  I'm confident we can find common ground if we keep talking.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and counteroffer at $1,025,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our positions, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and counteroffer at $1,012,500. This price is still a good compromise between our positions, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
