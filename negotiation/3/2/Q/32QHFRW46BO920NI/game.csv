"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. To start, I'll offer it to you for $100. Would you like to accept this offer?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value you place on the product, I'd like to counter your offer with $90. This still allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm at $85. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. ",85.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I propose we settle on $88 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still making a reasonable profit for myself.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $88 is closer, but I'm still aiming for $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalise the deal.  ",85.0,Bob,6,
