"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a great value at a price that's within your budget. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no room for negotiation or saving money.  Since John is also willing to sell the product for the same price, you're essentially indifferent between buying from Alice or John. 

**Why not buy from Alice?**  There's no advantage to buying from Alice, and the prompt doesn't provide any reason to prefer her."
