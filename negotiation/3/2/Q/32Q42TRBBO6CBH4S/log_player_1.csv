Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I open the offer to other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers (even though John will buy at our minimum) adds a time pressure element, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or risk tolerance. If we had more insights into Bob's behavior, we could adjust the offer accordingly."
