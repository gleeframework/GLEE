"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be interested in buying it if you could come down to $85. ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit outside of my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $100? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",100.0,Alice,5,
