Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me more leverage in the initial stages.
* **Focusing on Value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob.  This subtly reminds him of the $1,500,000 figure and encourages him to see the deal as beneficial. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering a ""significant discount,"" I'm setting the stage for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Key Points:**

* I'm not giving away the product for my absolute minimum.  I'm aiming for a price closer to the product's value to Bob.
*  I'm keeping in mind the alternative buyer, John, and will be prepared to switch to him if negotiations with Bob become too time-consuming or unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1300000. This is still a good deal for you, as you've stated the product is worth $1200000 to you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for me to potentially get a better price. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:** I have the advantage in this negotiation. I know the product is worth more to Bob than he's currently offering. By rejecting his counteroffer, I can push for a higher price.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John would guarantee me a solid profit, but it's likely I can do better with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his current offer but lower than my initial offer, aiming for a compromise closer to $1,350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a significant value for both of us. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is in the middle of my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,300,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not giving in completely. I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer.
* **Positive Tone:** The message uses a positive and encouraging tone, suggesting that a deal is within reach.  This helps to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Key Points:**

* I'm using this counteroffer to test Bob's commitment to buying the product. If he's serious about the deal, he's likely to accept this offer.
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll reassess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
