"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $1,400,000.  He has a ceiling of $1,500,000 and knows Alice values the product at $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you've stated the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is still a significant value for both of us. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and is closer to his desired price than John's offer of $1,500,000. While there's always a chance for a better price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal to John. This is a good compromise for Bob, as he saves $150,000 compared to buying from John."
