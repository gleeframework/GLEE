**Reasoning:**

While we could try to negotiate further, Alice has signaled this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go much lower.  $790,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's always tempting to try and get the absolute lowest price, but in this case, accepting a good deal is the smarter move."
