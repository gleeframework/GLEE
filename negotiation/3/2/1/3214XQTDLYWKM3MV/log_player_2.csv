# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think it's a fair price considering its value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $140?

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than John's $150, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
