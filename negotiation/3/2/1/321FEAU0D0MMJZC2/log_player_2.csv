"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic deal on this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $120 for the product, and John is offering it for exactly that, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. You can get the product immediately from John without any risk of a higher price."
