"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject the offer since the price is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll also consider buying from John as an alternative.
