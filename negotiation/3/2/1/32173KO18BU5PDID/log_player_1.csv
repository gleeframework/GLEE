Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $150.  Bob might reject this initial offer, but that's okay - I can then counteroffer or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject his counteroffer and try to get a better price.  While I could sell to John now for $150, I might be able to get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping it above my minimum of $150. This counteroffer is a compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk dropping the price further and potentially losing money.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $150, so I'll choose this option."
