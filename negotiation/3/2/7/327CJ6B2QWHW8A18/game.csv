"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it has the potential to be equally valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the conversation at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering to sell the product for $1,600,000. This price still allows me to meet my minimum requirement, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you'll receive.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more conservative. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need to be conservative, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down a bit further. I propose $1,550,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial price and is a fair reflection of the value you will gain.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can see you're serious about finding a fair deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still slightly below my minimum requirement.  To reach a final agreement, I'm offering $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring you.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
