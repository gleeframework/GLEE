Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he'd prefer $10,000, Alice's offer of $11,000 is still within his budget and closer to his desired price than John's offer of $10,000."
