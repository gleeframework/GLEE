{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $1,500,000. It's a valuable asset that can bring significant returns.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1200000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and see if I can push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum, I'd be willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000 to facilitate the deal. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $1275000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still some room to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,350,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter again and hopefully secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point.  $1,275,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's try $1,300,000.  It's a good compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, while still ensuring the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  $1300000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's aim for a final compromise: $1287500.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,287,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,287,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,287,500 is a good compromise and significantly closer to my desired price than the $1,200,000 I could get from John. Accepting this offer secures a better deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower offer or a stalemate."
