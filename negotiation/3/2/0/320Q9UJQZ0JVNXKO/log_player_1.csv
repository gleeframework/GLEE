Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential for reaching a deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to sell to John for your minimum price, so there's less pressure to immediately accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,600,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value ($1,000,000), it's still significantly below your minimum ($1,200,000) and your initial asking price. Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about the product's value and open to a more reasonable negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,100,000 falls significantly short of what I consider a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to continue this discussion, but I'd need to see a substantial increase to proceed.  Would you be open to a price closer to $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  Dropping the price by $200,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but the new price is still comfortably above your absolute minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the discrepancy between Bob's offer and the product's value reinforces your position.
* **Open to Continued Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states your openness to further discussion, encouraging Bob to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my financial situation, I'm unable to go above $1,250,000 for this product. I hope this revised offer is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,250,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving you to sell to John for $1,200,000. Accepting this offer secures you a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
