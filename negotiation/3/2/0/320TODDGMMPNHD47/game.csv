"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This reflects the value it brings while leaving room for a profitable venture on your end.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see that we are still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, but I can't go any higher than that.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product is truly above that mark.  Just to reiterate, acquiring this will not only provide you with [mention a specific benefit of the product, e.g., access to a new market/technology/customer base], it also holds the potential to [mention another significant benefit, e.g., increase your revenue/efficiency/brand recognition].  I'm open to finding a solution that works, but I need you to meet me closer to its real value.  To be fair, I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer in this range.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you outlining the product's benefits. While I agree they are substantial, my budget restricts me from going any higher than $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my own financial limitations.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
