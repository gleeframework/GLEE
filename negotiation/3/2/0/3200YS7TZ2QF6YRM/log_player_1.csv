"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm looking for $180 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing that Bob has room to negotiate.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but if not, we'll see where this negotiation leads."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial stated value, it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $150? That's a fair price for both of us, and ensures I can make a profit."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While tempting, $100 is still too low for me. I need to hold out for a higher price, as I'm confident I can get closer to my desired amount with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While tempting to sell to Bob at $110, I'm still feeling optimistic that we can get closer to my minimum price.  I'm willing to negotiate a little more to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is really my last offer, but I'm hoping you can see that it's a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are becoming increasingly unproductive.  While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not confident we'll reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
