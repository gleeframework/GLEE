{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly above my minimum but leaves room for potential counteroffers from Bob. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a new offer that's closer to my original price point to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm definitely still interested. How about we settle at $775,000?  That's a significant move on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $775,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'll counteroffer again, but I'll need to be careful not to risk losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  Let's compromise at $825,000. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures we both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. To close this out, I'm willing to offer $800,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm at a point where I need to decide if it's worth risking the deal with Bob by counteroffering again.  Accepting his offer ensures I secure the sale and get my desired minimum."
