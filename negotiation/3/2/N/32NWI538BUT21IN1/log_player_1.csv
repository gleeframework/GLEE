Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product and think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $115 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's room for Bob to counteroffer, which allows for a back-and-forth to potentially find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Protecting My Value:** The offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but also allows for potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Knowing my Alternatives:**  John's offer of $120 is my safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** $105 is less than my floor of $120.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can likely get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. 
* **Avoiding a loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss for me. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $105 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and I'll do $110. That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Offering $110 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer of $105 and my previous offer of $115.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, allowing for a profit.
* **Showing Flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  Continuing the negotiation keeps the possibility of a sale open and avoids the need to sell to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $105 again? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for negotiation:**  Bob has repeatedly offered $105, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Further negotiation seems unlikely to change his mind.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could prolong the process and potentially result in a lower price or a lost opportunity.
* **John's offer is secure:** John is a guaranteed buyer at $120, which is my minimum acceptable price and allows for a profit.

Selling to John ensures a quick and profitable sale."
