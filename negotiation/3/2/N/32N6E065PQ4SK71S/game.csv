"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $115? I think that's a fair price for this unique product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $115 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a price a little lower.  Would you consider $110? I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I believe $110 is a fair price that benefits us both.",110.0,Bob,4,
