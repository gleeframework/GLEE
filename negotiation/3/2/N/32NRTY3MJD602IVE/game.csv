"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I've done my research and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value is unknown to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budgetary concerns. While $1200000 is a respectable offer, it falls short of the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1350000. This price still offers a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I need to stay within my limit. I'll make a counteroffer of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
