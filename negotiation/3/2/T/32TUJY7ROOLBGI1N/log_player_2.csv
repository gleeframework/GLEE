"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, giving him leverage. Rejecting this offer might prompt Alice to propose a lower price closer to her actual value."
