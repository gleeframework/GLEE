"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it could greatly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,350,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to attempt to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point. I'm interested, but I'd like to offer $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects the value I'll get from the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,275,000? This allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,275,000, which is still within Bob's budget of $1,500,000 and significantly lower than John's price.  It's a reasonable compromise, and accepting allows Bob to save a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
