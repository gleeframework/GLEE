"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm open to finalizing a deal. How about $975,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the transaction. Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,5,
