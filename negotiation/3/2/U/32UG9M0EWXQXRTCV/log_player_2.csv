"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see great value in it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get it for less by negotiating.  There are 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before committing to either Alice or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. While I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  A $950,000 offer is a significant discount from Alice's asking price and represents a significant saving for Bob. However, it's not so low that it's likely to be instantly rejected.
* **Focus on fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair price for both of us,"" aiming to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and compromise.
* **Setting the stage:** This offer establishes Bob's willingness to negotiate and sets a lower starting point for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While Alice has come down from her initial offer, there's still a $50,000 gap between her offer and what Bob is willing to pay from John. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting this offer, Bob maintains the negotiating power and can try to push for a lower price.
* **Timing:**  It's still early in the negotiations, with 7 rounds remaining. Bob has time to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, Bob should counter with an offer closer to $1,000,000,  perhaps $1,025,000, to show he is serious about a deal but still willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,025,000?  This offer is closer to what I can afford while still ensuring you get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to the target:**  This offer is only $25,000 above Bob's ideal price from John, showing a genuine attempt to reach a deal.
* **Building on compromise:**  The message reinforces the idea of finding a fair price that benefits both parties. 
* **Setting a clear expectation:**  This offer clearly establishes Bob's final price range, making it easier for Alice to decide whether to accept or continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,035,000 as a final offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our time spent negotiating.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,035,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,035,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the target:**  Alice's offer is only $35,000 above Bob's ideal price from John. This is a relatively small difference, especially considering the progress made in negotiations.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  By continuing to negotiate, Bob risks Alice becoming unwilling to budge further or even walking away from the deal altogether. 
* **Time pressure:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, the opportunity cost of continuing to negotiate becomes higher.

**Conclusion:**

While Bob could try to push for a slightly lower price, accepting this offer ensures a deal and minimizes the risk of losing the product to another buyer or having to settle for John's higher price."
