"Thanks for the offer Alice. While I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,025,000?  This offer is closer to what I can afford while still ensuring you get a fair price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,035,000 as a final offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our time spent negotiating.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",1035000.0,Alice,5,
