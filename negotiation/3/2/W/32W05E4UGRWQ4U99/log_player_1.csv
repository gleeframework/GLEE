Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a significant offer that's still very appealing to me (Alice) as the seller.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive, but still ensures I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price point."
