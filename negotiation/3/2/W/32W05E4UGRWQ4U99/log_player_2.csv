You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that might fall within your acceptable range. If not, you can always fall back on purchasing from John at a lower price."
