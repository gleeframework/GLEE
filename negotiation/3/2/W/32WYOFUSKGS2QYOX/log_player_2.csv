# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.

Alice has met my best possible price. There's no point in rejecting to try and get a lower price, as she's indicated this is her minimum.  I'll accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
