"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're willing to start the negotiation at $130. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price.**  You're aiming to pay less than $150, and $130 is still too high.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice is willing to negotiate, so you can likely get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  You're not desperate, so you can use John's price as a benchmark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I'm interested, $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we set the price at $125 for the product? Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target price.**  $125 is still above your ideal price, but it's moving in the right direction.
* **You have room for further negotiation.**  Alice is showing flexibility, which suggests you can likely get it down further.
* **John is still a backup option.**  You're not in a rush, so you can keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $125. How about we split the difference and settle on $122.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your suggestion. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. Considering our previous discussions, how about we set the price at $124 for the product? This offers a slight compromise that I believe would suit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $124. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $124
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is very close to your target price.** $124 is only $4 above your ideal price of $120.
* **You've already made significant progress in the negotiation.** You've moved the price down from $130 to $124 in just a few rounds.
* **It's unlikely you'll get a much better offer.** Alice is clearly motivated to make a deal, and you risk losing the opportunity if you keep rejecting.
* **John's price is still a backup.** You can always buy from him, but Alice is offering a significantly better deal at this point."
