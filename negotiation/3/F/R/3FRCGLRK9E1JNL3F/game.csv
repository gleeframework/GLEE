"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to do it for $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $70, which would be $80. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
