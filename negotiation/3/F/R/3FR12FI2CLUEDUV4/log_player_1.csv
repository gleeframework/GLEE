Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Even though you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, it's always good to aim higher initially. Bob might be willing to pay more than his perceived value, especially if he believes the product is in high demand.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value and potential demand, justifying the high price.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This offer leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can gauge his interest and potentially settle closer to $15,000 while still making a profit. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired minimum."
