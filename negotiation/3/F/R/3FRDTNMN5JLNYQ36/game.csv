"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $14000?  That still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $11250 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again,  how about $12000?  It's a fair price that shows we're both willing to compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!",12000.0,Alice,5,
