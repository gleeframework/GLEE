{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a truly unique item that I believe would be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, knowing the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to pique Bob's interest.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if I want to accept it or make a counteroffer myself, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer of $12,500 is still above my minimum threshold of $10,000, but I believe I can get a higher price.
* **Strategic Value:** I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob. He's shown interest in the product, and I think I can leverage that interest to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my original offer of $15,000. I'll likely propose something like $13,500 or $14,000 to see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $14,000?  That still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between Bob's offer ($12,500) and my previous offer ($15,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $14,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm not giving up too much value.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging Bob to consider my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great, we have a deal!
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer. If it's too low, I might choose to sell to John for $10,000, as the negotiation may not be worth my time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $11,250 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Bob's Interest:** Bob has shown a strong interest in the product, consistently making counteroffers. This suggests he values it and might be willing to go a bit higher.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $12,000 or $12,500. I'll emphasize the value of the product and point out that my previous offer of $14,000 was already a significant compromise. 
* If Bob rejects my next offer, I'll need to carefully consider whether to accept his offer of $11,250 or sell to John for $10,000. I'll weigh the potential for further negotiation with Bob against the risk of losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $11,250 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again,  how about $12,000?  It's a fair price that shows we're both willing to compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm proposing $12,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's current offer ($11,250). This signals a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Positive and Urgency:** I'm using encouraging language like ""Let's make this deal happen"" to incentivize Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! We've reached a successful agreement.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll need to seriously consider selling to John for $10,000.  Bob's persistent low offers suggest he might not be willing to come up much further. However, I'll still evaluate if there's any room for further negotiation with Bob before making a final decision."
