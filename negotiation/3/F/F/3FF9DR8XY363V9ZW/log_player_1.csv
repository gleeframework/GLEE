Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the message positively, highlighting the value of the product. This might encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer. 

Remember, this is just the first step. I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and keep John's offer ($12,000) as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $15000. Would you consider lowering the price to $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still above my ideal outcome. It's worth pushing for a better price, especially since I know John will buy the product for $12,000 if I need to.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to go down to $17,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying firm:** I'm not drastically lowering my price, showing I believe in the value of the product.
* **Framing it as a compromise:** I'm suggesting a ""fair compromise"" to make the counteroffer seem reasonable to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with a question again, inviting Bob to respond and potentially reach an agreement.

This counteroffer attempts to strike a balance between getting closer to Bob's offer while still securing a price that's more advantageous for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to propose a price of $16500 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000 and it's within my acceptable range. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether, especially since he stated it's the highest he can go.  

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision to maximize my earnings and secure a sale."
