Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as justified. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  While I have John as a backup, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is the priority."
