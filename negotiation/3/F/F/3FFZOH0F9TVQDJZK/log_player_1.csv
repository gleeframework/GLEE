Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a price of $1,150,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and willing to negotiate. While his offer is increasing, we are still significantly above our guaranteed sale price with John.  We have room to negotiate further and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I respect that. However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,187,500? That's my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $1,075,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has significantly jumped down in his offer and presented it as his ""final offer."" This indicates he may be less willing to negotiate further. At $1,075,000, we are now getting dangerously close to John's guaranteed offer. It's not worth the risk of Bob walking away and ending up with a worse deal. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation uncertainty."
