"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,200 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to look elsewhere.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,150. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10150.0,Alice,7,
