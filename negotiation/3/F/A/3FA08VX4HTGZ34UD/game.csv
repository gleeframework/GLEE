"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000,  which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
