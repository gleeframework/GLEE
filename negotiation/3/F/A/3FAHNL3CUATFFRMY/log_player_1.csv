Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the fact that other buyers might be interested (""before I list it publicly"").
* **Leaving Room:** By asking ""What do you think?"", Alice invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared to potentially negotiate down from $20,000. If Bob outright rejects this initial offer, she can gradually lower the price, ensuring she doesn't go below her $15,000 minimum (her guaranteed sale price to John)."
