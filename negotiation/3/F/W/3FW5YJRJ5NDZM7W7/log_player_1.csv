{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $15,000, but I believe it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product.  I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't interested in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $17,000. This is still above my minimum price, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise given that Bob's offer was far too low. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I consider fair for the product.  I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to offer Bob $15,500. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my absolute minimum price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John."
