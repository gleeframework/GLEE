"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to $9,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This is a great deal for you, considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,600.  That's a fair compromise and closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and I'm confident that I can still make a profit on the sale."
