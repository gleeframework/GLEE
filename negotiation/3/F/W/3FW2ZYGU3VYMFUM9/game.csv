"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This is a great deal for you, considering the product's worth.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,600.  That's a fair compromise and closer to my budget.",8600.0,Bob,4,
