"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,000. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That's a fair compromise between our positions.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
