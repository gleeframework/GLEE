"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a price that's beneficial for him.  We still have negotiating room and time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate our negotiation so far.  To prevent this from going back and forth endlessly, I'm willing to accept $1,050,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm holding firm at a price closer to my initial offer, but giving a finality to encourage Bob to accept. This prevents further lowballing and ensures I get a price significantly above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting his offer at $1,030,000 secures a profit significantly above John's offer, avoiding the risk of losing Bob entirely in further rounds."
