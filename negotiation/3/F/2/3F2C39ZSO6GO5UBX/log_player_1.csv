Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to someone like you. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Reasonable Offer:** Offering it for $12,000 leaves room for negotiation but ensures a significant profit above my minimum ($8,000).
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By highlighting this as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" I aim to entice Bob to accept quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
