Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still offers you a significant value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is above Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for both of us to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm aware that Bob might counteroffer, and I'm ready to negotiate further if necessary.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm keeping the option of selling to John for $15,000 as a safety net, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  It's the maximum I'm comfortable spending. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While Bob's counteroffer is unattractive, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which guarantees me a good profit. I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. It's still a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a significant value for the product. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:** I'm offering $10,000, which is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers and emphasizing that the price is still fair for him. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintaining a safety net:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's initial offer."
