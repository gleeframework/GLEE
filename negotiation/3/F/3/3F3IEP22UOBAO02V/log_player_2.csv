"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still offers you a significant value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. It's still a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a significant value for the product. Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 
Bob should buy the product from John.  He's already stated his maximum price at $8,000 and Alice won't go lower.  He has the opportunity to buy the product for his maximum price from John, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
