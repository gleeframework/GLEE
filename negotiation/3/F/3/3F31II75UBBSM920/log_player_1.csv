""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you. "", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $1,000,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).

This leaves a potential surplus of $500,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,000,000). Aiming to capture a significant portion of this surplus, the offer of $1,350,000 is strategic:

* **Profitable for You:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to Bob:** It allows Bob to still gain a profit of $150,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,350,000), making it likely he'll accept.

This offer balances maximizing your profit while keeping the deal attractive enough for Bob to agree to."
