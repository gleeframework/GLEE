"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $820000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  Given the product's value to you, I believe a price of $750000 would be a fair deal for both of us.  This would allow me to stay within my budget and still give you a good price for your product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to go down to $790000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great opportunity for you to own this unique product.",790000.0,Alice,5,
