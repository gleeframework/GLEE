"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground here. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
