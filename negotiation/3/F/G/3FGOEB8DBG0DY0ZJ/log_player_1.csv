Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but still leaves me with a profit.  It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, so I don't need to accept any offer that is significantly lower than my minimum price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $800,000. While I want to sell the product, I'm not desperate. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm countering with $850,000.  This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and hopefully gets us closer to a deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, so I'll accept it. While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better deal.  It's also important to remember that John is a reliable backup buyer, so I'm not in a rush to close a deal."
