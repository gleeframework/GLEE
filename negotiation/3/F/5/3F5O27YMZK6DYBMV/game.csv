"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me to earn a significant profit.  Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000. Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
