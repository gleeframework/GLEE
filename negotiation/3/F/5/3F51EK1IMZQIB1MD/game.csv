"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product significantly exceeds that. I can come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while still leaving you with a significant return on your investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have to be honest, $1,250,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000, and that's my final offer.  I believe this is more than fair considering the value this product brings. I do have other interested parties, but I believe you would be a perfect fit for this.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
