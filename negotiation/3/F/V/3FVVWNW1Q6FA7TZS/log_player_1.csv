"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for an item of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential"" to create a perception of scarcity and high demand.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""fair starting point"" signals my willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** By starting high, I increase the chances of securing a deal closer to my desired price.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response to this initial offer will reveal how much he truly values the product and how aggressively he's willing to negotiate. 
3. **Maintain the Option of John:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup, but I want to explore maximizing my profit with Bob before settling for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even his own perceived value ($1,000,000). This suggests he's likely attempting to anchor the negotiation very low.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal.  While I have the option to sell to John immediately, I'll use a few more rounds to see if I can reach a more favorable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and engaging in this negotiation. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true market value and the value it offers. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Higher Counter:** I'm making a smaller concession ($250,000) than Bob's lowball offer. This signals that I'm serious about a higher price point.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, subtly anchoring the discussion around value rather than his low offer.
* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** By making a concession, I'm showing flexibility while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Steer the Negotiation:** I'm aiming to move the negotiation closer to my desired range.
2. **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  His response will tell me how much he truly wants the product and how much he's willing to budge. 
3. **Keep John as a Backup:**  I'm still keeping the option to sell to John open, but I'm invested in exploring a potentially higher profit with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. To move this forward, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  I feel this is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while acknowledging my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased significantly, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  His message suggests he's getting more serious, but I believe there's room for further negotiation.  I'm willing to push a bit further before considering accepting his offer or moving to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, and it seems like we're getting closer to a number we can both agree on. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a substantial concession from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, signaling my willingness to close the deal.
* **Meeting Halfway:** By positioning this price as a midpoint, I'm appealing to a sense of fairness and compromise.
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  While I'm showing flexibility, I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).

This strategy aims to:

1. **Encourage a Deal:** This offer makes it tempting for Bob to accept, given the substantial price reduction. 
2. **Maintain Profitability:** I'm still aiming for a price that generates a significant profit.
3. **Approaching Decision Point:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to deciding whether to accept Bob's best offer or proceed with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're definitely making progress.  While $1,750,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $1,250,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to negotiate a better deal, but his offer of $1,250,000 is still below my $1,500,000 minimum. While he's moving in the right direction, I need to hold firm and signal that my last offer was a serious attempt to find a compromise. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push him closer to my acceptable range. However, I need to be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but my last offer was a significant step to meet you halfway.  To be transparent, I have another interested buyer at a higher price. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant compromise, and I need a decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition and Urgency:**  I'm subtly mentioning ""another buyer at a higher price"" (John) to create a sense of urgency and competition. This might nudge Bob to make a more serious offer.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm conveying the seriousness of my position and pushing Bob to make a decision. 
* **Slight Concession, Firm Stance:** I'm reducing my price slightly to $1,600,000, showing flexibility but remaining above my absolute minimum.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Elicit Bob's Best Offer:** By creating a sense of urgency and finality, I'm hoping Bob will either accept this offer or counter with a number close enough to my minimum for me to accept.
2. **Maintain Control:** I'm staying in control of the negotiation by setting a clear deadline and expectation. 
3. **Prepare for John:** I'm mentally preparing to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my price requirement in the next round."
