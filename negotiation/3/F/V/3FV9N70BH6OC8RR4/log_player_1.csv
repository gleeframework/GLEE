Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000.  What would work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a good deal for you and gets us closer to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
