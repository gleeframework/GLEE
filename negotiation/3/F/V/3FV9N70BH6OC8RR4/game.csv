"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a good deal for you and gets us closer to an agreement. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can do.  How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
