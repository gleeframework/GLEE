"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me and $10,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. Considering the product's value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. Let's meet in the middle again!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your price and still within my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $9,500. Considering the product's value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $10,800. This is a fair price, taking into account the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find a solution.",10800.0,Alice,5,
