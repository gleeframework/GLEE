"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a good deal for Bob while still leaving room for negotiation. It's also important to remember that John is a safety net at $1,000,000, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to John's price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $1,150,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer to show flexibility and willingness to compromise. It's still a good deal for Bob, and I'm confident he'll see the value in it."

Bob's offer is equal to what I can get from John.  I'm confident that John will close the deal right away.  While I'd love to get more for the product, there's no guarantee that Bob will offer more in the remaining rounds, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal."
