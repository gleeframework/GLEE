"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $12,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $12,750 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $12,800, but that's as low as I can go.",12800.0,Alice,5,
