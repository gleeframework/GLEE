Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000, knowing that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Building rapport:** I'm trying to build rapport with Bob by starting with a friendly message and suggesting a ""fair"" price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

This approach allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also giving Bob a chance to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay $1,500,000. This gives me the leverage to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob if I counteroffer strategically.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation process and try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I value your proposal, $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I'm starting by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing respect for his perspective.
* **State my minimum price:** I'm explicitly stating my minimum acceptable price of $1,700,000. This sets a clear boundary and prevents further unnecessary lowball offers.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between holding firm on my minimum price and demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1500000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with John's offer, which is the same.
* **Secure the deal:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale at my minimum price, which is a positive outcome. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I minimize risk and ensure a successful sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
