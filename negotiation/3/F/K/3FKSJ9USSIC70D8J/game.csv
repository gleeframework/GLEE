"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $120. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I'm not sure if this product is worth that much to me.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $97.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about $102.50? This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to be careful with my budget. How about $95? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",95.0,Bob,6,
