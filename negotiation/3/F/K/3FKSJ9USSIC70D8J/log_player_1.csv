Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I'm not sure if this product is worth that much to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $90, I know the product is worth more to me than that. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $97.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $97.50 is close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about $102.50? This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to be careful with my budget. How about $95? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, we're getting close to my minimum price, and there's a chance we won't be able to reach an agreement.  John offers a guaranteed $100, which is a better outcome than risking another round of negotiation with Bob."
