"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $8000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $10000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $9000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
