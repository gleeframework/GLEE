"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that benefits both of us. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I suggest a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that allows for a substantial return while still being competitive for you. Please let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.  This would allow both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am prepared to offer the product at $890,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit.
