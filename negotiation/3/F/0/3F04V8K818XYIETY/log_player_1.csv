Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,250,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000. This is a fair price considering my own assessment of the product's value. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm prepared to offer $1,875,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a fair balance between our respective valuations. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,875,000

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we're still above Bob's valuation, accepting $1,875,000 secures a significant profit. Continuing to push for a higher price risks Bob walking away, leaving us with John's offer of $1,500,000."
