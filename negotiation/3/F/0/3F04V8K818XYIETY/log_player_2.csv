{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,250,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a clear negotiation range and shows Bob is serious about a deal, but not willing to pay Alice's asking price.
* **Strategic Move:**  A $500,000 reduction is a sizable amount, but it leaves room for further negotiation. It signals to Alice that Bob is willing to compromise.
* **Setting the Stage:** This counteroffer creates a foundation for future negotiations. Bob can adjust his offers in subsequent rounds based on Alice's reactions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value I place on this product is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target of $1,500,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000. This is a fair price considering my own assessment of the product's value. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is increasing his offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but staying within his budget.
* **Strategic Move:**  The $150,000 increase is smaller than Alice's previous decrease, pushing for a more favorable deal.
* **Emphasizing Value:** Bob mentions his assessment of the product's value to justify his offer, emphasizing his understanding of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm prepared to offer $1,875,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a fair balance between our respective valuations. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1875000}
```
