"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, you can likely get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's $150 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $130 is still a good price for me. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might get frustrated and walk away, forcing me to buy from John for $150. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a price within my budget without unnecessary risk."
