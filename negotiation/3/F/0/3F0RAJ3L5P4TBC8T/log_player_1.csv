"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a high anchor. This can potentially shift Bob's perception of the product's value and leave room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value, conveying confidence in the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you signal a willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in a multi-round negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is quite high though. I'm thinking something closer to $700,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and your initial offer.  Accepting would result in a substantial loss. While selling to John is always an option, it's too early to concede. There's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the value you'll gain from this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:** Clearly rejecting Bob's offer while explaining why it's unacceptable prevents misunderstandings and demonstrates that you're serious about getting a fair price.
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** Coming down by $300,000 shows flexibility but avoids drastic changes that might make you seem desperate or willing to accept a low price.
* **Reiterating Value:**  By highlighting the product's value again, you aim to steer Bob away from focusing solely on the price difference. 

This approach continues to aim high while showing a willingness to negotiate towards a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but that price is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That's a significant offer on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer! Bob's offer is now above your minimum threshold ($1,500,000). However, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. By rejecting and countering, you signal that while you're finding common ground, you believe the product is worth more. You're willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer demonstrates serious interest, and I appreciate the movement we're seeing. To be fair, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,650,000.  This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to find a compromise. "",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Progress:**  Recognizing Bob's movement (""serious interest,"" ""willingness to find a compromise"") helps create a more positive and collaborative atmosphere for the negotiation.
* **Strategic Concession:** You've come down $250,000 from your previous offer, showing flexibility but maintaining a strong position above your $1,500,000 floor.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""fairness"" and the ""true value,"" you subtly nudge Bob to consider your perspective and the value you're offering.

This counter-offer strategically positions you to potentially close the deal above your minimum, while still leaving room for a final round or two of negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Would you be willing to settle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, as Bob's offer is getting very close to your minimum. However, we are only on round 6 out of 10. By rejecting, you signal to Bob that you are firm on getting at least your minimum price. You are willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation for one more round to try and secure an extra $100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are close. I value the progress we've made.  To be completely transparent, $1,500,000 is my absolute bottom line. I believe this is a fair offer reflecting the true value of the product. Let me know if you're able to meet this."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness:** Acknowledging that you are close to a deal keeps a positive tone.
* **Transparency:** By stating your bottom line clearly, you eliminate uncertainty and demonstrate seriousness. 
* **Finality:** The tone implies this is your final offer, encouraging Bob to accept without further negotiation.

This approach aims to secure the best possible outcome in the remaining rounds."
