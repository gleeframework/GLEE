Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could we settle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I could push for more, accepting at $1,175,000 is a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away. It's always possible he would go higher, but there's also a chance he drops his offer or the negotiation stalls. Taking this offer secures a good deal."
