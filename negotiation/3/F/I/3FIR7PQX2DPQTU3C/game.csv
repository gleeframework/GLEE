"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is quite high for me.  I'm more comfortable in the range of $600,000.  Would that work for you?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,100,000? This recognizes the value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we settle around $700,000? That feels like a fairer reflection of its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, to make this work, I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of this product. Could you consider $950,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I'd be willing to go up to $750,000. I'm hoping we can close this gap soon.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. To demonstrate my own flexibility, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. However, this is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon due to other interested parties. ",900000.0,Alice,7,
