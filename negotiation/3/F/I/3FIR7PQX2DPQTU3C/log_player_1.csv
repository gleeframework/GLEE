"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is quite high for me.  I'm more comfortable in the range of $600,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  We'll work our way closer to a more reasonable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,100,000? This recognizes the value while acknowledging your initial offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we settle around $700,000? That feels like a fairer reflection of its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

We're making progress, but $700,000 is still too low. We'll keep negotiating to close the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, to make this work, I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of this product. Could you consider $950,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I'd be willing to go up to $750,000. I'm hoping we can close this gap soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is getting closer to our minimum, but we still have room to negotiate and a few rounds left. We need to incentivize him to make a significant jump."
