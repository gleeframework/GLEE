"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. However, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price, allowing for a potential profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's my minimum acceptable price, but also closer to Bob's perceived value. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value for you, but I have a firm budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This offer stands as my final offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,750.  This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows my willingness to compromise, while also leaving some room for further negotiation. I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
