"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you!  I'm asking for $170, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) but not too high to scare Bob away immediately.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm showing flexibility, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Highlighting value:**  My message mentions the product being ""perfect for you"" to make Bob think about the potential benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **I have better options:** I can either counteroffer Bob or sell to John for a much better price. 
* **Counteroffering is a better strategy:**  While selling to John is a safe option, counteroffering gives me a chance to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $170 to $130.
* **Maintaining value:**  $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't sell below what the product is worth to me.
* **Staying firm:**  My message emphasizes that $100 is ""too low"" to show that I'm not going to accept anything significantly below my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm really keen on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John is a safer option:** While Bob is ""keen"" on the product, there's no guarantee he'll continue to raise his offer. Selling to John for $150 provides a certain outcome.
* **Potential for stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting stuck in a stalemate or getting a lower price. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $125, but that's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or walk away.
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but showing some flexibility to encourage a deal. 
* **Threat of Alternative:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly hints at the possibility of selling to John, making Bob more likely to reconsider."
