"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. He has options to negotiate further or buy from John for a lower price. It's beneficial to explore those options before accepting the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is only $750 more than what Bob can get from John. Given that Bob has limited rounds and wants to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision. This secures the product and avoids further negotiations that could potentially lead to a higher price or a failed deal."
