Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we try $9,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, and Alice is unlikely to go that low."
