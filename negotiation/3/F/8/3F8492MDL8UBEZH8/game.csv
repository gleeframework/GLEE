"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I think this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This reflects my willingness to make a deal while still recognizing the product's worth.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
