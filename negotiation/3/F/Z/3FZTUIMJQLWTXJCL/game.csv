"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
