Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to consider the product for $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.

You have three options:

Bob's offer:

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
