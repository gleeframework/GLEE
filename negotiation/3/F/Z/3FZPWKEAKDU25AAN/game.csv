"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to consider the product for $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a bit below what I had in mind, I'm willing to move closer to your price. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $1,000,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my financial constraints.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
