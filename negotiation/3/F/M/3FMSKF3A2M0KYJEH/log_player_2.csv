Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go down to $80, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90. How about $85? It's my final compromise on the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

```

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $85.  Since you can buy the product for $80 from John, it makes more sense to take that offer now."
