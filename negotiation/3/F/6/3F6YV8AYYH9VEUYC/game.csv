"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12000?  I'm ready to close the deal if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
