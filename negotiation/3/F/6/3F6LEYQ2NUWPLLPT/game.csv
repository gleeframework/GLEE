"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already given you a discount from my initial price of $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $13,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $13,250. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",13250.0,Alice,5,
