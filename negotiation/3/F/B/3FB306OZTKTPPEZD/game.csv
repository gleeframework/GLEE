"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $9,500? I'm really interested in the product, but need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,000? This is my final offer, and it aligns with my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
