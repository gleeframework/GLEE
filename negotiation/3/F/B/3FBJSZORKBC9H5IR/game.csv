"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I believe this product is worth that to me, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your target price, Bob, but I have to prioritize getting a good deal for myself. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not there yet.  $1,100,000 is the highest I can go at this point. If you're willing to consider that, I'm happy to close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to look at other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I need to think about the minimum I can get away with. I can do $1,150,000, but I'm not going any higher than that. It's the best I can do. If you're still interested, let's talk turkey!",1150000.0,Alice,5,
