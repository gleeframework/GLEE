"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $18,000.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a profit. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for him to meet me halfway.  I'll see how Bob reacts before considering going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, which is my minimum. It's better to reject his offer and try to reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is a compromise that's closer to my initial asking price and still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob's willing to pay $15,000, so this offer is within his range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $15,000, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round. Selling to John would only get me $15,000, so I'm better off accepting Bob's offer."
