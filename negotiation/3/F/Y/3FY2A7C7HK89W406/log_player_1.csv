Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $1,000,000, I allow for some negotiation without risking going below my minimum threshold. 
* **The ""John"" Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 provides me with a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can't meet the price of $1,000,000. How about we try something closer to my valuation? How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still below my desired profit margin.
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **""John"" Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000?  That's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but not to give in too quickly.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering $975,000 is a compromise that shows I'm flexible while still protecting my minimum threshold.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to ensure he understands the price is still reasonable.
* **Seeking a Deal:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and focusing on finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. While I understand your position, I would like to propose a price of $960,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially reaching a lower price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum desired profit.

**Conclusion:**

At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the risk of reaching a lower price or wasting valuable time. Selling to John is the most logical and profitable decision."
