"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is $14,000.  There's room for negotiation to potentially save some money. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. By offering $13,000, Bob is splitting the difference between Alice's offer of $14,000 and his own upper limit of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $14,500, which is closer to Bob's maximum limit of $15,000. However, Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. By rejecting the offer, he can attempt to get a lower price in the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's price, but there's still some room for negotiation. Bob is willing to go up to $14,000, which is still lower than Alice's previous offer. This counteroffer represents a compromise, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate but also his desire to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum limit of $15,000. There's no further room for negotiation to save money. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will go lower. To avoid further negotiation, Bob should accept John's offer, as it's the same price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
