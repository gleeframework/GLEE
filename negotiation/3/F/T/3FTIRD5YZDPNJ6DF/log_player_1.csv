"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate while still being profitable.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal considering the product is worth $8,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
``` 

I'm countering with $9,800. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will be close enough to Bob's offer to entice him to accept, but still higher than the $9,500 he offered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I still have some rounds left and want to try to get a higher price. I believe I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm countering with $9,600. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough to Bob to accept, as it's closer to his offer while still being within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

I'm countering with $9,400. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, but it shows I'm still trying to get a better price while acknowledging that I might need to make a concession. With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping this will be enough to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $8,800 is too low.  I'm not confident I can get a better price in the remaining time, and selling to John for $12,000 ensures I get my minimum value.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on."
