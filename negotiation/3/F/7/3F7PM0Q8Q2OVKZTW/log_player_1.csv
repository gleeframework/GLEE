Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can always lower the price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'm happy with $12,000, I'm going to try to see if I can get a little bit more from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will be a compromise Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is lower than my minimum.  While I could counteroffer again, it's likely this negotiation won't lead to a better price.  John is already offering my minimum, so I'll sell to him to guarantee the best possible outcome."
