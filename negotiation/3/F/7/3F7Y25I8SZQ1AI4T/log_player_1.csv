Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. It's important to start high to gauge Bob's interest and leave space for concessions later.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This keeps the negotiation going and allows me to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still a reasonable price given my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal while still leaving some room for negotiation if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $17,500 is only $2,500 less than my initial asking price. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it is still a decent profit and it would be more work to continue the negotiation. There is a chance he could come down further, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
