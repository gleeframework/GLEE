"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential earnings. I'm also mindful of the 10-round limit, so I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, always keeping John's $1,200,000 offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it's too early to settle. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I still have 8 rounds to potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm reducing the price by $150,000 from my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm aiming for a gradual decrease in price to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more. With 6 rounds left, I still have time to negotiate a better price. Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'd rather try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering the price again, but only by $100,000 this time.  I'm showing willingness to compromise, but still trying to get as close to my target as possible. With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with such a low price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm willing to sell to John, but I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob with 4 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm lowering the price by another $100,000.  I'm trying to strike a balance between showing flexibility and still getting a decent price.  With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to be mindful of the time constraint, but I'm hoping this counteroffer will finally get Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high. While I'd prefer to earn more, I'm not comfortable risking losing the deal entirely.  John's offer guarantees a secure $1,200,000, which is above my minimum threshold. Selling to John is the best option at this point."
