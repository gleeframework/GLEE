Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves some room for negotiation. If he rejects it, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, but I'll try to get as much as I can."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price of $80.  I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum price of $80. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident Bob will accept it."
