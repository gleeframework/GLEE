"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant discount for me but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to me to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message is open-ended, leaving space for Bob to respond with a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and focusing on the value proposition, I aim to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  Even if Bob negotiates down, I'm likely to get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintain control:**  I'm setting the initial terms and pushing Bob to make the first move.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal how seriously he's considering buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your value for it and my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value ($8,000), it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for me to negotiate a better price, and I believe I can get closer to my target.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and demonstrate my commitment to achieving a fair price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Focus on Value:** I will reiterate the value of the product, potentially highlighting the value to Bob to motivate him to increase his offer. 
* **Avoid Selling to John:** At this point, selling to John would result in a significant profit loss.  I'm confident I can reach a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  This product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop the price to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth and your potential benefits.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Value:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price, demonstrating flexibility while still emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Appealing to Benefits:** I'm highlighting the potential benefits for Bob,  encouraging him to see the value of investing in the product.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  The $9,500 price is still above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) but offers a significant discount from my initial offer, potentially making it more attractive to Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Gaining Momentum:** I'm aiming to close the gap and get closer to an acceptable price.
* **Creating Pressure:**  This counteroffer puts the pressure back on Bob to either accept or negotiate further.
* **Building Trust:** By offering a compromise, I aim to build trust and demonstrate a willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's a substantial profit for me, especially considering the limited rounds left.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering again risks him walking away, potentially leaving me with no sale and losing out on the opportunity to sell to John.
* **Time Pressure:**  With limited rounds remaining, it's crucial to capitalize on a potentially profitable offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Accepting the Offer:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a good deal, allowing me to maximize my profit while mitigating the risk of losing the sale altogether. 
* **Focus on Future Deals:**  While I would ideally prefer a higher price, accepting this offer allows me to move forward and focus on future deals where I might achieve a better outcome."
