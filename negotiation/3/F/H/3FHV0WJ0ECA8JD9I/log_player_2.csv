"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  You can likely get a better price than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your value for it and my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  This product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop the price to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth and your potential benefits.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to your budget, you still have room to negotiate further. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps you in the driver's seat and allows you to make a counteroffer to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
