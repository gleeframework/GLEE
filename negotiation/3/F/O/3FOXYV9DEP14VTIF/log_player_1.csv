Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  Offering it at $1,400,000 or higher might be perceived as too greedy and could lead to immediate rejection. 
* **Backup Plan:** It's important to remember we have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, ensuring we don't lose out entirely if Bob declines."
