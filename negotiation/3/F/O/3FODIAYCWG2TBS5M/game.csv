"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This price is fair and allows us both to make a profit.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Let's try $1,350,000. This price still allows you a considerable gain, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,300,000?  This price allows for a fair profit for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
