# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Let's try $1,350,000. This price still allows you a considerable gain, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit.  Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, so he's willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get a lower price from Alice."
