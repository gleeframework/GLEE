Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob and frames the offer as a fair compromise. This helps build a positive negotiating environment. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, I hope to secure a quick deal. If Bob rejects, I can still counter-offer or move on to John, ensuring I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This price is fair and allows us both to make a profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'm willing to explore a compromise, but I won't accept anything below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Let's try $1,350,000. This price still allows you a considerable gain, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,350,000:** This price is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above Bob's desired price but lower than my minimum.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product. It also frames the counteroffer as a ""fair"" starting point for a compromise. 

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate. This also puts pressure on him to make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price. If Bob again refuses, I'll be ready to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,300,000?  This price allows for a fair profit for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to that mark, accepting this offer ensures a relatively quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially resulting in a lower price or having to sell to John. 

**Strategy:**

The risk of further negotiations with Bob is that he might become more resistant and refuse to budge further.  Accepting his offer now allows me to secure a sale with a profit, even if it's not as high as I initially hoped for."
