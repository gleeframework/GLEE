"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Bob can likely get the product for closer to his budget by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $11,000. This is still higher than Bob's budget of $10,000. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000.  This saves him $1,000 compared to Alice's final offer and ensures he gets the product within his budget."
