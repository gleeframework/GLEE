{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to discussion, allowing for a potential counteroffer. 

This offer strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** I'm starting high, hoping to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** I'm not being overly aggressive, which could scare Bob away.
* **Provide an acceptable fallback:**  I have John as a backup buyer if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's willing to pay more than my backup buyer, John. This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $700,000 but lower than my initial offer of $950,000.  This will keep the negotiation going and hopefully bring us closer to a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $700,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $950,000 to $850,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him to strengthen my position.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $850,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, protecting my bottom line.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to further negotiation, keeping the dialogue open.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  This price is closer to Bob's offer, increasing the chances of agreement.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Keep the process moving forward:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive and prevents a premature exit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  
* **Close to the middle ground:** While Bob's offer is closer to my previous counteroffer, it's still not in my best interest financially.
* **Opportunity for a final counteroffer:**  Bob seems to be willing to negotiate further, indicating there's still room for improvement.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $775,000, aiming to find a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price while still remaining within a reasonable range for Bob. This approach aims to finalize the deal without having to sell to John."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm lowering my price to $825,000, which is only $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement while still protecting my financial interests.

* **Closing Language:** I'm using language like ""finalize the deal"" to suggest that this is my final offer and I'm hoping to conclude negotiations.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the Deal:** This price is likely within a range that Bob is willing to accept, making a deal more probable.
* **Minimize Risk:**  While I'm compromising, I'm still within a reasonable margin of my minimum acceptable price, mitigating potential losses.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to reject this offer.
