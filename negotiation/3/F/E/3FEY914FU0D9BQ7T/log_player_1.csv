"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this product.  It's something I value highly, but I believe it has even greater potential in your hands.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. This is a chance to own something truly extraordinary."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, Start Strong:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value sets a strong initial point. This leaves room for negotiation while communicating the product's value. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and potential, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping the John offer ($1,000,000) in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, you can always fall back on this guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its worth to you. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the value it holds for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above your minimum, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  Rejecting this offer signals that you see the product's value as higher. We have ample rounds to work towards a price closer to your initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product goes beyond $1,200,000. It's not just about the inherent worth, but the unique advantages it offers.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, the counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's offer, reaffirming your belief in the product's higher value.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's unique benefits to justify the price, moving beyond a simple price discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. However, we are still significantly above your guaranteed sale price with John. By continuing the negotiation, we can apply pressure and potentially secure a price closer to $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's bridge this gap.  I'm willing to consider $1,300,000 if we can close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating a strong desire for the product. We're now entering a phase where smaller concessions can still yield a favorable outcome.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By introducing a ""close today"" element, we create a sense of urgency and opportunity for Bob. 
* **Strategic Target:**  $1,300,000 is a strong position â€“ a significant gain from Bob's initial offer while still allowing for potential movement if needed in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, but I need to be convinced that this is the best price for both of us. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob is now very close to our target price of $1,300,000, demonstrating significant commitment to the deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could potentially push for another $25,000, the risk of alienating Bob and losing the deal increases. The difference in potential gain is now relatively small.
* **Time Value:** Securing a deal now at $1,275,000 is a very favorable outcome. It provides a significant profit compared to your minimum and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
