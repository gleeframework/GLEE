"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still a significant amount higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but still leaves room for further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a slight improvement from his previous offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to try to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and is significantly higher than my minimum value. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away and I'll have to sell to John for a lower price."
