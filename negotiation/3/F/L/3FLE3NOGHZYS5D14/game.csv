,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd need to be closer to $6,000 to make this work.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $8,500, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would that be feasible for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8000.0,Alice,5,
