"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. While it's worth significantly more to me, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price point that reflects its value to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This price allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a substantial discount, while still leaving me a comfortable profit. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a discount from the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's budget.  He can get the same product from John for a much lower price."
