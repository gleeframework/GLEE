"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15000 is simply too low.  I'm offering you the product for $17500. It's a fair price considering the value I know this product holds.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $17500 is a good price. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to see a more significant discount. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13000. Can you meet me in the middle?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $13000 is just too low for me.  I'm offering you the product for $16000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's compromise and finalize the deal at this price.  This is my final counteroffer, and if it's not accepted, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to see a price that's more in line with my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,6,
