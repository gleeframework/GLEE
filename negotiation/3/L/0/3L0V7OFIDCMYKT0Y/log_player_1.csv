Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can build rapport and make Bob more open to the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning that the product is ""great"" and something Bob will ""love"" subtly suggests its worth.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If Bob rejects, I'll need to gauge his interest level and adjust my next offer accordingly. 
* **Consider John's Offer:**  I'll always keep in mind that John will pay $120, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Counter-Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates that he's interested in the product. This presents an opportunity to counter-negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $120 is a secure option, there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraint. While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while hopefully being within your budget. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a drastic loss. 
* **Appealing to Budget:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns and emphasize that $100 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone can help keep negotiations open and encourage Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I'll need to assess Bob's response and either accept his counteroffer (if it's reasonable) or adjust my offer further if necessary. 
* **Consider John:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I'll fall back on John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to accommodate my budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is only $30 below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited Upward Potential:**  It's unlikely that further negotiation will get me much closer to my ideal price. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with John's offer of $120.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept and Close:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a reasonable profit and avoids potential loss."
