"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to others. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While the offer of $11,500 is higher than Alice's value, it's still lower than your maximum price of $12,000 and lower than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $500 compared to your alternative."
