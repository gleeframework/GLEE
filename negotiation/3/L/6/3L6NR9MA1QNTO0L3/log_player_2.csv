"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is exactly $120, accepting her offer is the best option.  Bob doesn't gain anything by rejecting and buying from John."
