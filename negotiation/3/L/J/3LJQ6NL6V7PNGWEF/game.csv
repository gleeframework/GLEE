"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? That's the highest I can go.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $10,000? It's a fair price that's closer to my asking price, and it ensures both of us are happy with the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? That's the absolute maximum I can afford.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $9,800. This is a significant price reduction from my original offer and still allows for a reasonable profit for me.  If you're serious about buying this product, I believe this is the best we can do.",9800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,300? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",9300.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, and I really appreciate your commitment to this purchase.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500 as a final concession.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a good price.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?",9500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and go to $9,400, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to accept this price, I'll make a commitment to buy the product.",9400.0,Bob,10,
