"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$6,000 is a good starting point, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  It's worth seeing if we can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground.  Since I have a maximum budget of $15,000, I'm aiming to leave myself some room for potential concessions later on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still willing to try for a lower price. I'm going to reject and counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still keeping it lower than Alice's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $5,500, which is a reasonable price considering my maximum budget of $15,000. I'm getting a good deal here, and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Alice getting frustrated and refusing to sell. It's better to secure the product at this price than to potentially miss out on it completely."
