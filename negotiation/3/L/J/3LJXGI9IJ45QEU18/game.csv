"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $800,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $800,000, so how about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $750,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $780,000. This reflects the value of the product for you, and it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",780000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we meet at $795,000? That's the best I can do.",795000.0,Bob,6,
