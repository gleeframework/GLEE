"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $135.  If that works for you, let's make a deal. ",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $135 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $142.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",142.5,Alice,5,
