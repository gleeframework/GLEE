"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum value of $1,000,000, giving Bob room to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potentially get a quick deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a more realistic price point that might be more appealing to Bob. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we both can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is slightly above my minimum value, and I'm willing to accept it. While I'd prefer more, I'm getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether."
