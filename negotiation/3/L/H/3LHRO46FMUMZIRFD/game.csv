"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great interest to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a significant value, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $12000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This would still give you a great deal while allowing me to fairly compensate for its unique qualities.",13500.0,Alice,3,
