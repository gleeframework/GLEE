This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our discussion.

Considering the product's worth to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000. It's better to buy from John at $800,000 and avoid the risk of the negotiation failing."
