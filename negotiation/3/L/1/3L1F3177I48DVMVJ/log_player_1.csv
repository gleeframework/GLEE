Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering what it offers, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (even if vague about ""value"") can make Bob more receptive. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying you're ""open to hearing [Bob's] thoughts,"" you signal willingness to negotiate, potentially leading to a quicker sale.

**Why this strategy is beneficial:**

* **Best-Case Scenario:** Bob accepts the $19,000 price, earning you a significant profit.
* **Likely Scenario:** Bob negotiates. You can then gauge his interest and potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Worst-Case Scenario:** Bob rejects the offer. You lose nothing and can proceed to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
