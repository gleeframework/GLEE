"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $12,000 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  How about we settle at $10,500 and call it a deal?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to accept $10,500 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
