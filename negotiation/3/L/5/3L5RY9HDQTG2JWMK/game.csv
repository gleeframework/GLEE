"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If not, I'm open to exploring other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. To be honest, $1,050,000 is a little too far outside my budget. My best offer is $950,000. If that works, we can close the deal now.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
