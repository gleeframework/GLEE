"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. While I understand your perspective, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer. Our product, while valuable to you at $600000, retains a higher intrinsic value to us. To better align our interests, I propose a revised price of $700000. This still offers a significant discount to its true value, while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still not convinced that $700000 is the best price for me. I'd like to make a revised offer of $650000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to me, while also being respectful of your company's valuation.",650000.0,Bob,4,
