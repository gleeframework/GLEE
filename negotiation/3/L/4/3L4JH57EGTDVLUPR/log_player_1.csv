{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's higher than the minimum you're willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation, and it's still within a reasonable range considering the value to Bob.  

Keep in mind: 
* This is just the first step. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response. 
* Don't be afraid to walk away if you don't get a satisfactory offer, as you have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below what you're hoping to get.  You have room to negotiate further with Bob and see if you can reach a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,125,000. I believe this strikes a good balance between the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is only $25,000 less than your counteroffer and significantly higher than John's offer. At this point, it's in your best interest to accept his offer and secure a sale.  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely."
