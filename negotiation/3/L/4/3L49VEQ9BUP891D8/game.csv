"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However,  $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $87? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make this work.",87.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $87 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $86?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can come to an agreement.",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $88? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm trying to find a middle ground. Let's see if we can make this work.",88.0,Alice,5,
