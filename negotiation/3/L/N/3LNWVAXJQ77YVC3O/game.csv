"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $500000 is still a bit too low for me to consider. Considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1200000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

This is a fair price that takes into account your willingness to negotiate, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.
