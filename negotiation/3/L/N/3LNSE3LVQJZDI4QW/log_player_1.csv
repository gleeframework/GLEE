Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows Alice to potentially gain more than the guaranteed $100 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob finds $150 too high, the offer opens the door for negotiation.  Bob might counter with a lower price, still netting Alice more than $100.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer provides Alice with a safety net, allowing her to confidently start with a higher asking price."
