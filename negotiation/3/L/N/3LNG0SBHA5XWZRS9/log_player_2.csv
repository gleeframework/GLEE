"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I think is a fair and reasonable starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her valuation of the product.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a lower price and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I want to keep the pressure on and see if she's willing to go lower.  Rejecting allows me to counter with a lower price once again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking with your previous offer, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a bit higher than your previous offer, but still lower than my initial one. I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting closer to my desired price, but $1,050,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I want to see if I can push her even lower before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000, which is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but higher than your latest one. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price.  While $1,075,000 is still higher than my last counteroffer, it's getting close to what I'm willing to pay.  I've already rejected a few offers and it's possible Alice might be less willing to budge further.  It's also important to consider that I only have a few rounds left before I'd have to buy from John at a much higher price.  This offer is a good compromise and secures the product for a price I'm comfortable with."
