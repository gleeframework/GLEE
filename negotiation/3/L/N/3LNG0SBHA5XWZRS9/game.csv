"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I think is a fair and reasonable starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a good compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking with your previous offer, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a bit higher than your previous offer, but still lower than my initial one. I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000, which is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but higher than your latest one. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
