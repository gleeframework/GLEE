"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our discussion.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fairer deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
