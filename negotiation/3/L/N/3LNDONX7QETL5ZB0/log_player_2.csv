Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $9,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to bargain, and there are more rounds left. You can also always buy from John for $8,000 if you're not happy with the negotiations."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,100 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is being stubborn and the price is still above your budget.  You have only three rounds left. It's unlikely you'll get Alice to come down further, and you risk losing time and a good deal. It's best to buy from John for $8,000, ensuring a lower price and a quicker purchase."
