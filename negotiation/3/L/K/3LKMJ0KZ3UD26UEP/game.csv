"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for this product. This is my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price that shows I'm serious about buying the product, and it's still significantly less than your initial offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go higher than $9,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's the best I can offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'm going to have to purchase from another seller.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're feeling pressure to move forward, but I'm still not willing to sell at $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise at $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However, $10,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800. This is a small increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in buying the product from you. This is my final offer.",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point of no return. I'm willing to make one last offer at $11,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options.
