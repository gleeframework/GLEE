"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better.  Since Bob's maximum price is $120, there's room to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $90 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his target as possible.  Starting at $85 is a good middle ground, showing that he's serious about buying but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her initial offer.  Bob is still looking for a better deal and has the opportunity to counteroffer again.  There's still room for negotiation and the potential to reach a price closer to Bob's target.  Since Bob has 10 rounds, he can afford to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $88?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to stick to his target price while also showing flexibility. Offering $88 is a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle.  This counteroffer might be appealing to Alice as it's closer to her desired price than Bob's previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $88. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer you the product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still higher than Bob's target price, and he has the opportunity to negotiate further.  There are still 5 rounds left, and Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Since Bob's maximum price is $120, he has some room to maneuver.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counteroffer and continue trying to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go to $90.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to reach a price closer to his target. He's showing that he's serious about buying the product by offering a price that's close to Alice's previous offer.  This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to accept, as she's likely to be losing money if she rejects and Bob moves on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not getting the value I want for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there are still a few rounds left to negotiate.  Bob has the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.  He has a clear target price of $90, so he should aim to stay within that range. It's risky to accept, given that John is a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll go up to $91.  I think this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 91} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get closer to his target price while still showing flexibility.  Offering $91 is a compromise that's a bit higher than his previous offer but still below Alice's.  This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to accept, as it's a good price for her and she's running out of rounds to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $91 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not getting the value I want for my product. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $93. It's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $93 is still higher than Bob's target price of $90.  With only one round left, there's not enough time to negotiate further.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $120, even though it's higher than his desired price.  This ensures that Bob gets the product, avoids further negotiations that might lead to a stalemate, and still stays within his budget."
