"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $18,000? This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $17,000?  I'm really trying to make this work, but I also need to be fair to myself.",17000.0,Alice,5,
