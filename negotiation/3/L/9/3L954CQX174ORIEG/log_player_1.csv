""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm happy to part with it for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit beyond the guarantee.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still offers a substantial saving compared to my backup offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing me to gauge his interest level and potentially negotiate a higher price."
