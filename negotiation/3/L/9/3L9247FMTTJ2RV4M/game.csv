"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $22,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $18,000 is still a little high for my budget, I could consider something around $14,000.  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
