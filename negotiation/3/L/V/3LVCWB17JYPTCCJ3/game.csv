"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This would still give you a great price, and it's fair for me as well.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $12500. How about we meet at $11500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11500 is still a bit too low for me.  Since we're both trying to find a middle ground, how about $11750?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit above $11750. How about we meet at $11500? I'm willing to pay that, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Bob,6,
