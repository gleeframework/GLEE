Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum value ($1,200,000), I'm still holding out for a better deal. I have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
