"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we can still try to negotiate a better deal. Getting her closer to $10,000 is ideal before considering accepting her offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to a price we'd consider, but we're only $125 away from John's price. There's still room to negotiate and potentially save that extra money before defaulting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To make this easy, I'm willing to offer $10,000 even. This saves us both time and gets the deal done."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer puts the ball firmly in Alice's court.  We're matching John's price, so it's her decision whether to accept a slightly lower profit margin for a guaranteed sale or continue negotiating and risk losing the deal altogether."
