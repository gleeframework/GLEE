Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer. It's important to start strong to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,600,000, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his valuation.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and creates a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price and also not as high as John's offer. Therefore, selling to John guarantees me a better price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
