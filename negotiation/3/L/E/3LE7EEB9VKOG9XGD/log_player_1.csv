Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This means any price above that will likely make him decline.
* **The Unknown:**  We don't know how much *more* than $800,000 Bob might be willing to pay if he sees the value as slightly higher. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to potentially capture some extra value from Bob, but not so high that you scare him off and lose the sale.

**Possible Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You're starting with a strong but not outrageous offer.
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""unique value and potential"" you give Bob a reason to justify the higher price in his mind.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, you've left some space to potentially negotiate down closer to $800,000 if Bob pushes back.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:**  How Bob responds to your initial offer will determine your next move. Be prepared to negotiate.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While you have John as a backup, never reveal this to Bob. It weakens your negotiating position."
