"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to the value it provides. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This would allow both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Your offer of $1100000 is getting closer to what I believe this product is worth. Let's split the difference at $1150000.
