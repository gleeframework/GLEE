"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that can bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still early in the negotiation.  There's potential to get an even better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my target, it's still above what I'm willing to pay right now. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if Alice is willing to go lower. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $8700. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,700, which is very close to my target price of $8,500.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it's also risky.  If we go back and forth much more, Alice might get frustrated and decide to sell to someone else.  At this point, it's a good deal for me, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid any further risks."
