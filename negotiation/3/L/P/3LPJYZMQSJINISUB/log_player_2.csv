It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $1,200,000 is above your budget, and you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John as a backup."

Let's start with a significant counteroffer.  $900,000 is still a good price for you, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate."

We're getting closer to the target price. A counteroffer of $950,000 shows you're serious about buying but still want a good deal."

While $1,050,000 is tempting, it's still above your budget.  Keep negotiating.  You might be able to get Alice down to $1,000,000 or even lower."

This is your final offer. It's your target price, and you're ready to buy at this point. If Alice rejects, you'll go with John's offer."

Alice's offer is still slightly above your target price. It's time to move on and secure the product from John at $1,000,000.  You've successfully negotiated a lower price, but it's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
