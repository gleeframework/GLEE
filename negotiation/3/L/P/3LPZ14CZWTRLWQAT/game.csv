"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product presents a mutually beneficial opportunity, I think your starting price is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify a price that high. How about we settle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering both our positions.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer of $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again if you're willing to compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to move a bit more on the price. Would you consider $800,000? That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,6,
