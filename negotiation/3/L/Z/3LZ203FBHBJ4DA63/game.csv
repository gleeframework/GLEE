"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try $850,000? I think that's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my initial offer. How about we try $825,000? I think that's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I respect that.  Tell you what, let's split the difference - $812,500. That's my final offer.",812500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $812,500. I'm still a bit short on my initial offer, and I need to stay closer to that. How about we try $820,000? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair compromise.",820000.0,Alice,7,
