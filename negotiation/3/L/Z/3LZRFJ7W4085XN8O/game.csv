"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. Would that be workable for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $12,000. It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible. However, I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a decent profit. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $11,500. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
