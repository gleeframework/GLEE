"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $12,000. It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible. However, I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a decent profit. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $11,500. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,500.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $10,000 than risk Alice not budging further."
