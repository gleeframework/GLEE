"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000)  and my minimum ($1,200,000) leaves space for counteroffers and finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Option:**  The fact that I have another buyer (John) willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase price closer to $800,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting this would be a substantial loss. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, it indicates he's interested. There are still eight rounds left to negotiate a more reasonable price.
* **Leverage of John:** I'm not in a position where I need to accept a low offer. Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives me the power to walk away from deals that don't meet my needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I could consider a price of $1,350,000.  This offer takes into account the product's worth while still providing you significant value."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** While I'm rejecting his low offer, I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price.
* **Targeting Above Minimum:** My counteroffer is strategically placed between Bob's lowball offer and my $1,200,000 minimum.  This aims to create a zone where a mutually agreeable price can be found.
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out numbers; I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially influence Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Time Consideration:**  With seven rounds remaining, there's still time for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. To be realistic, I could go up to $900,000. This offer reflects a fair price that considers both the product's value and my own financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer increased, $900,000 remains significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum. Accepting would mean a considerable loss.
* **Slow Progress:** Bob's counteroffers are increasing at a slow pace, suggesting he might be trying to wear me down rather than engage in good-faith negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing John is willing to buy at my minimum allows me to be firm. It's better to reject low offers and explore if Bob will come closer to a reasonable price. 
* **Time Remaining:** With six rounds left, there's still room to negotiate, but I need to see more significant movement from Bob to justify continuing with him instead of taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still significant.  To show you I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making it clear that this is my best offer, introducing a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price significantly to be closer to my $1,200,000 minimum but staying above it. This leaves room for one final concession if necessary without going below my acceptable point.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** By explicitly stating this is my final offer, I emphasize the compromise I'm making and put the ball back in Bob's court. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With five rounds remaining, Bob needs to decide if he's willing to meet me closer to my price or risk losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However,  $1,275,000 is just beyond what I can justify. To be completely transparent, the absolute most I can offer is $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal given market conditions and the product's value. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $950,000, even as his ""absolute most,"" is still significantly below my firm minimum of $1,200,000. Accepting would be a substantial loss I'm not willing to take.
* **Unlikely to Negotiate Further:** Bob's language (""unfortunately have to explore other options"") suggests he's unlikely to move much higher.  Continuing negotiations with him would likely be unproductive and frustrating.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for my minimum acceptable price. There's no logical reason to continue negotiating with Bob when I can secure a fair deal with John immediately.

**It's important to recognize when to walk away from a negotiation, especially when you have a strong alternative option.**"
