Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm aiming for a win-win scenario where Bob gets a good deal and I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not going to settle for it immediately.  There's a chance I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and see what he counters with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but still closer to my desired value. Hopefully, this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable value.  While I could continue to counter-offer, there's no guarantee he'll increase his offer, and I'm risking the chance of losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me a sale at my minimum value, so that's the best course of action."
