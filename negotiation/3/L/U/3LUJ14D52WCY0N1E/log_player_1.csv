"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), I still have some room to negotiate.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a little more. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has remained consistent with his offer of $11,000. This is a good price for me, considering my minimum acceptable price is $10,000.  Further negotiation might take us through more rounds and I risk losing the deal with Bob altogether.  It's time to accept and close this deal."
