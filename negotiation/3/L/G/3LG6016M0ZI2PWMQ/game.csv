"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that considers its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept such a significant discount from my initial price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $9,000. This price reflects the value of the product while considering your budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm working with a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value of this product and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What are your thoughts?",8500.0,Alice,5,
