{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that considers its value to me."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept such a significant discount from my initial price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $9,000. This price reflects the value of the product while considering your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm working with a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value of this product and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. It's better to secure the known price from John than risk further negotiation with Alice."
