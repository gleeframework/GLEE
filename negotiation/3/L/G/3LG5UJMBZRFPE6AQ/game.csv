"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $11,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $13,000.  However, I'm still only able to offer $11,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to go with another seller.",11000.0,Bob,4,
