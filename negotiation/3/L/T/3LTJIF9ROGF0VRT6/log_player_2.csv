Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has great potential to benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've started with a significant reduction from Alice's offer to show my intent to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Alice's offer and expressed my willingness to negotiate, while stating my position clearly.  
* **Price:**  $750,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's offer and close to her value of $800,000. This gives Alice room to counter while still potentially leading to a deal beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a significant decrease from her initial offer and still within my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a good chance of a stalemate, and I'd risk losing the deal entirely.  At this price, I'm saving $350,000 from my initial maximum budget and getting a good deal.  It's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product."
