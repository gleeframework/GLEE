"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has great potential to benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. ",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
