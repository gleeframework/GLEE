"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but your asking price is far too high for me. This product is valuable, but not at that price point. I'm willing to offer $600,000. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $600,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. I've done my research, and its capabilities would bring substantial value to your operations.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product could bring, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my limit.  It's a fair offer considering your last price drop.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your budget constraints, but I also need to ensure this deal reflects the true value of what I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle â€“ $1,050,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and recognizes the  benefits you'll gain.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground, that price is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  This is a strong offer, and I need you to meet me closer to this range if we're going to make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position on the budget, but I need you to understand that this product is a game-changer. The return on investment will far outweigh your initial outlay.  My final offer is $975,000. This is a substantial reduction, and I'm firm on this price.",975000.0,Alice,7,
