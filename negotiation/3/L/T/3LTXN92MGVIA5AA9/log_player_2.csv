Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $600,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. I've done my research, and its capabilities would bring substantial value to your operations.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  She's come down in price, but it's clear she's unlikely to reach a number you're comfortable with.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, which is far better than Alice's ""final offer""."
