"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $900,000, it's still below my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It's still above my minimum value, and I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000 for the product.  I will reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,025,000. This is a further compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still within my desired range.  I'm hoping he'll recognize that we're getting closer to a deal, and he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle for less than $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum acceptable price and also aligns with what John is offering. If Bob rejects this, I'll move on to John."
