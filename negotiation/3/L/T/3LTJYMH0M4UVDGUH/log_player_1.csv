Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product for $110. It's worth every penny, and I think you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $100. I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me make sure I'm getting a good deal too."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product, considering it's worth $100 to you. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $92 is getting closer, I'm still determined to get closer to my minimum of $100. It's worth pushing a little further in the negotiation, especially since John is a guaranteed sale at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. How about we meet at $95? It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to where we want to be. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $92 again, as I mentioned earlier. Can we stick to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  We're getting close to my minimum price, but I'm starting to run out of time and rounds.  John is a guaranteed sale, so it's the best option to ensure I get a price I'm happy with."
