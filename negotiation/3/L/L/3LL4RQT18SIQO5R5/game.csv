"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price, given its value to both of us.  While I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $800,000, I'm hoping to strike a deal with you that's mutually beneficial. Please let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,
