Alice's offer is still quite high. There's room to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $12,000."
