"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me some leverage.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to get him thinking about the potential benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  While $15,000 is tempting, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still gives you a great value, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's price but still above my minimum. 
* **Compromise Language:** I'm framing my counter-offer as a compromise to show that I'm willing to work with Bob. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm still emphasizing the value Bob will get at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9500? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  While $15,000 is tempting, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to that price. 

It's important to note that I'm approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and while John's offer is secure, there's still a good chance I can get a better price with Bob by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you - $9,500 is closer to what you're hoping for. I'm still aiming for a bit more, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. Let's try $10,000.  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still trying to get a price above my minimum.
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Approach:**  I'm using a common negotiation tactic, suggesting a midpoint between our last offers.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message upbeat and encouraging Bob to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9250, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** While $15,000 is tempting, I'm not ready to accept it yet. There's still a chance I can get a better price with Bob. 

With only four rounds left, I need to carefully consider each offer and balance my desire for a higher price against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I understand you're sticking to your $9,250 offer. To show you I'm serious about a deal, I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a significant concession by lowering my price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:** I'm signaling that this is likely my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Fairness:** I'm still framing the offer as fair, using language like ""compromise"" and ""best I can do."" 
* **Urgency:** Implicitly, I'm suggesting that if Bob doesn't accept, we might be nearing the end of the negotiation. 

**Why this strategy?**

With only three rounds left, I need to balance getting a good price with the risk of losing the deal. By making a significant concession while still being close to my minimum, I hope to encourage Bob to accept. However, if he rejects, I'm prepared to move on to John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9375? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're down to the last two rounds. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is high.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:** It's more advantageous to secure the higher price from John and avoid the uncertainty of continued negotiations with Bob.

By selling to John, I guarantee a good profit and avoid the potential disappointment of a failed negotiation with Bob."
