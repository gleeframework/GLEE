"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still ensuring I make a profit. I don't know Bob's valuation, so starting high allows me to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away.  Bob is clearly trying to lowball me, and I believe I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see how he responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm lowering my price to $180. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still allows me to make a profit. I believe this is a fair price that could potentially convince Bob to accept.  If he rejects again, I'll be prepared to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has increased his offer to $160, which is above my minimum price of $150. This is a good deal for me, and I'm willing to accept it to close the deal.  I'm not sure how much longer I can continue to negotiate with Bob, and the risk of losing out to John is becoming more real."
