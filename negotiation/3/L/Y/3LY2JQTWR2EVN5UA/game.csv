"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but we need to find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $1,300,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
