"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer. You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $120. There is room for negotiation to find a price that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject the offer. While $135 is better than buying from John, you are still willing to pay less and there is room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, it is likely that Alice will not go lower than $132.  Accepting the offer gets you the product for a price that is within your budget and cheaper than John.  There is a good chance Alice will not lower her offer and you risk losing the opportunity to buy the product at a good price."
