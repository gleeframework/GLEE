"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product!  I'm asking $12,000 for it.  It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we settle for $9,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $10,000.  While $9,500 is tempting, I think I can get a better deal with a counteroffer.  I also want to avoid selling to John at this point, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get $10,000.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,800?  I'm really hoping to make this work, and I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 9800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've come down quite a bit, I appreciate that. Let's make it $9,600 and call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the best offer Bob has made so far, and it's only $400 below my minimum desired price. With only four rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $10,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
