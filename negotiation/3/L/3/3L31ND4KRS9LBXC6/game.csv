"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $8,000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway from my initial offer.

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.
