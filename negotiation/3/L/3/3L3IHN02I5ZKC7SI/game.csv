"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows both of us to make a worthwhile transaction.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To find common ground, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This is higher than your initial offer but still below our original asking price. I believe this could be a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product to us and your budget.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and would allow both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This is closer to your offer but still slightly above our initial asking price. I hope this proposal will help us move forward towards a successful transaction.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to my target, I'm still only able to offer $9,000 for the product.  This represents a fair deal for both of us and would allow us to close this transaction.  I'm hoping you'll see the value in this offer and accept.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your patience, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept a price of $9,500 for the product. This is the highest price I can reasonably accept, given its value to us and the fact that we've already discussed the price extensively. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",9500.0,Alice,7,
