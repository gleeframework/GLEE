"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to us, we're looking to sell it for $15,000. This is an exceptional opportunity considering its worth to you is $8,000. Let's discuss how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's more than double what the product is worth to me.  It's not even worth considering. I'll start negotiating and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows both of us to make a worthwhile transaction."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To find common ground, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This is higher than your initial offer but still below our original asking price. I believe this could be a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product to us and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved a bit closer, $12,000 is still a lot more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll counteroffer again, but if she doesn't come down further, I'll be ready to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and would allow both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This is closer to your offer but still slightly above our initial asking price. I hope this proposal will help us move forward towards a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my price, $10,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up a little more, but only if she's also willing to compromise further. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to my target, I'm still only able to offer $9,000 for the product.  This represents a fair deal for both of us and would allow us to close this transaction.  I'm hoping you'll see the value in this offer and accept."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept a price of $9,500 for the product. This is the highest price I can reasonably accept, given its value to us and the fact that we've already discussed the price extensively. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is only $500 more than my last offer.  While I'd still prefer to pay my initial $9,000, it's not worth risking the deal and going another round.  I'm happy with this price and will accept Alice's offer."
