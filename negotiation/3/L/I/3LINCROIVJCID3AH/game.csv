"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but I'd need to see it for $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $110.  If that works for you, I'd be happy to move forward.",110.0,Bob,4,
