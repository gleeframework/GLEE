"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000. However, you know the product is worth significantly less to Alice ($800,000). By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price, closer to Alice's perceived value, and save even more money."
