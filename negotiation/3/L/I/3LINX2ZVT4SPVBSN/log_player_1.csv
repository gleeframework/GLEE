Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This is crucial information in maximizing your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, the offer leaves some room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter, but it's likely to be above your acceptable minimum. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer far exceeds your minimum acceptable price ($800,000 from John), ensuring a significant profit.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential gain from his acceptance outweighs the risk of going with John's lower offer."
