"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique features you mentioned, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $16000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two offers. How about we meet in the middle at $18000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make it happen. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $17000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $17000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your offer. How about we meet at $17500? It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make it happen. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
