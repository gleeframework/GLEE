{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I think it would be a valuable asset to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John.
* **Negotiation Tactic:**  By starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price, you create a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob. It also leaves little room for Bob to counter-offer with a price significantly lower than your target. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer, knowing you have another buyer. However, it's a calculated risk to maximize potential profit."
