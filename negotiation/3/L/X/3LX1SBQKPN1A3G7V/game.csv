"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,875 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $8,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
