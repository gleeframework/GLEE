"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a rare gem that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $9,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  It's in his best interest to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $8,500 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for a lower price from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice again, or simply buying from John."
