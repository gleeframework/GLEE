"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $6,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is $8,000 to you.",6000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm not quite ready to commit to $6,000 just yet.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This feels like a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $7,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $7,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",7200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,200 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $7,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $7,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",7100.0,Alice,5,
