"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, while still aiming for a good profit.  I'm curious to see how Bob responds and gauge his potential interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise, moving halfway between Bob's offer and my initial offer. I believe this price is still fair given the value of the product to me, but also signals my willingness to negotiate and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $145 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, and given the limited rounds remaining, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of a further decrease in price or even losing the deal altogether. It's important to weigh the potential gains against the potential losses in each round of negotiation, and in this case, I believe securing a sale at $145 is the best decision."
