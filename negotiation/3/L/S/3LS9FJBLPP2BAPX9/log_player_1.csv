"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($120).  This leaves room for negotiation, but also signals that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still confident in selling the product for a higher price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a profit above my minimum.  $125 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to hold out for a better deal, hoping he'll come up closer to my desired price.  If he doesn't, I'll be comfortable selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it. If not, I'll go with John's offer."
