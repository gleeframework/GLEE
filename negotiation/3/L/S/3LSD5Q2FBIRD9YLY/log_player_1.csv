I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $15,500 is still a good deal and a fair compromise. It's also a better outcome than selling to John for $15,000."
