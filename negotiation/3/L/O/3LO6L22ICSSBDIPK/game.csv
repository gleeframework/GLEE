"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my minimum asking price and still allows you a good profit margin. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me as well. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This still offers you a good profit margin and keeps the deal profitable for me. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
