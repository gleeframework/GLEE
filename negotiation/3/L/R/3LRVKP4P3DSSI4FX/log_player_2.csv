"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer is above his maximum price point. It's more advantageous to try and negotiate with Alice, even if it means potentially buying from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a negotiating range and signals Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal. While the offer is still within Bob's budget, it leaves room for Alice to counter while still potentially giving Bob a good discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's ideal price. Bob is determined to save as much money as possible, so he'll continue negotiating with Alice. There's still room for Alice to come down further, and it's worth seeing if they can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly, demonstrating his flexibility while still trying to secure a good deal. This counteroffer is a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest proposal, making it more likely to be accepted by Alice.  It also keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $500 below John's price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of further negotiation rounds.  It's more efficient and less time-consuming to simply buy from John at his fixed price, securing the product within Bob's budget and avoiding further negotiation uncertainty."
