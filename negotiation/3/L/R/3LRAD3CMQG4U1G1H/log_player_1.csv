Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you first for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with an offer just below your guaranteed sale price to John ($150) allows you to potentially maximize profit if Bob accepts.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **First Refusal Incentive:** By emphasizing that you're offering it to Bob first, you create a sense of exclusivity, potentially making the offer more appealing.

It's important to note that while this is a strategically sound opening offer, Bob might still reject it. You have the security of John's offer as a fallback."
