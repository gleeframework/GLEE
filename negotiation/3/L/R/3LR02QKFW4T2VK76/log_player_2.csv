"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget considerations.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This offer reflects its significant value while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,000.** This is still within Bob's budget of $10,000, and a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **The negotiation has moved closer to Bob's desired price.** While $8,500 would be ideal, meeting in the middle at $9,000 is a reasonable compromise.

**Considering the risks of further negotiation:**

* **Alice might reject another counteroffer.**  This could lead to a stalemate or Alice becoming less willing to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's more expensive.**

**Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $9,000 is the most logical choice, as it balances saving money with minimizing risk.**"
