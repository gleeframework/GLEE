Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to start higher with Bob.
* **Potential for higher profit:**  A starting price of $1,500,000 gives you a chance to potentially earn an extra $300,000 if Bob accepts. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's still room to negotiate down towards $1,200,000, ensuring you don't lose out on the sale entirely.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the initial offer and potentially having a short negotiation."
