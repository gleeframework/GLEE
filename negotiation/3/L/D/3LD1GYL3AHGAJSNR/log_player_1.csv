Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,500, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  This initial offer leaves enough room for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for further negotiation. 
* **Plan B:**  Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. This gives me a safety net and bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $8,800 is significantly less than my desired minimum of $10,000.
* **Counteroffer Potential:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail, giving me leverage. 

I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,200. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I truly believe this product will be worth every penny for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price to $9,200. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I earn a decent profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, emphasizing that it's worth the price. 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm explicitly stating that this is a significant discount from my initial offer.
* **Building Momentum:** This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about reaching a deal and encourages Bob to accept. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $9,200 remains above my minimum price of $10,000, giving me some buffer if Bob makes another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,900? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $8,900 is still below my target.
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation could drag on, potentially costing me valuable time and effort.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which meets my minimum requirement and ensures I don't lose out. 

Selling to John is the most efficient option in this situation, as it offers a sure profit and avoids the risk of potentially further decreasing the price to a point where it becomes unprofitable."
