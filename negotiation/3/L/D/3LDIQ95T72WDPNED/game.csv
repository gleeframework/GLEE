"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my own valuation.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $975,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
