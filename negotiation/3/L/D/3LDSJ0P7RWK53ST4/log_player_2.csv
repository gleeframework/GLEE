Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $1,200,000 is simply too far from where we need to be.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,550,000.  However, I need to be upfront â€“ I have another buyer ready to close at my asking price.  I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need you to meet me closer to this number for that to happen.
