"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for less than $100 from Alice, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is a better offer than Alice's previous one, you can still potentially get the product for a lower price. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $92, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 92}
