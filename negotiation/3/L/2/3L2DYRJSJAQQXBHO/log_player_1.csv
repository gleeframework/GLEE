Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and sets the price at $100. This is a decent starting point, as it's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start with a price that you're comfortable with, but also allows for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $92, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my target price of $95. At this point, it's not worth risking losing the deal for a couple of dollars. Accepting his offer will allow me to secure a good profit and avoid the risk of having to sell to John for $80."
