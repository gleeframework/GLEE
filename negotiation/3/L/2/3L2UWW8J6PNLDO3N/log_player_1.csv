Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the fact that I could purchase it elsewhere for $800,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
