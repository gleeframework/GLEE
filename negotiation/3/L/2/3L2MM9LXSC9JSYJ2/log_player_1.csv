Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his perceived value is higher than John's.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below $800,000, ensuring Alice still makes a significant profit.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""potential value"" and ""unique"" nature to justify the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  If Alice pushes too hard, Bob might walk away, forcing her to accept the lower offer from John. 
* **Relationship Building:**  While maximizing profit is key, Alice might consider a slightly lower price if building a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable."
