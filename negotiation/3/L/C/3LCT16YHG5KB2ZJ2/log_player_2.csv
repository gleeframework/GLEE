"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its true value to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate down towards our $800,000 limit, especially since we have the backup option of John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would make sense.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious starting point:** We start significantly lower than Alice's offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and open to discussion:** The message maintains a positive tone and invites further negotiation. 
* **Strategic positioning:** By starting low, we aim to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product for you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down a bit, $850,000 is still above our maximum budget and our fallback option (John's offer). We need to push Alice closer to our range. We'll continue negotiating, but we're also getting closer to accepting John's offer if needed."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  We're moving upwards significantly to show willingness to compromise, but staying below our absolute limit.
* **Seeking compromise:**  The language emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Pressure point:**  This offer is getting closer to Alice's likely break-even point, adding pressure to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. $725,000 is a good offer, but it's still a bit lower than what I need.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $775,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** Alice has signaled this is her last offer, making further negotiation unlikely. 
* **Acceptable price:**  While not ideal, $775,000 is within our budget and a significant savings compared to her initial offer.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Continuing to push could lead to a stalemate and force us to buy from John at $800,000 anyway. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it and potentially paying more."
