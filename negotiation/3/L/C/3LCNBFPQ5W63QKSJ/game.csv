"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8,000 on this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This feels like a fair deal considering the product's worth.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline the $12,000 offer. My maximum budget remains at $8,000. I hope there might be room for compromise within this limit.",8000.0,Bob,4,
