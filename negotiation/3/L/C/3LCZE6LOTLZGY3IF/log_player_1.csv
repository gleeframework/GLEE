Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 to John provides leverage.  You don't have to accept an offer below that price. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal that's highly profitable for you while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept."
