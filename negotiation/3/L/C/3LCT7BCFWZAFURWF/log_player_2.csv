"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $7,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $7,200. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, further haggling is unlikely to result in a significantly better deal. Accepting the $7,200 offer secures a decent discount compared to John's $8,000 price."
