"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $100, but $90 is still too close to that limit. 
* **You have room to negotiate.**  There's potential to get a better price, especially since you're willing to pay more than Alice's minimum.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** This means you have leverage to push for a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:**  A $5 reduction from Alice's offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Staying within your budget:** $85 is still within your acceptable range and leaves room for potential concessions. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is worse than her first offer.** While you're open to negotiating, Alice's offer has moved further away from your desired price. 
* **You're not desperate.**  You have the option to buy from John, which means you don't need to accept a bad deal to get the product.
* **More negotiation room:**  Alice's counter-offer indicates she's willing to negotiate, so you have more room to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between your previous offer of $85 and Alice's current offer of $92. 
* **Signal flexibility:**  It shows Alice you're willing to move closer to her price but still maintain your desire for a lower price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  You're still within your budget and have the fallback option of buying from John, so you don't need to cave to Alice's pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse.** Her offer has gone up again, now exceeding your initial $90 limit. 
* **The negotiation is not moving in your favor.** It's likely Alice is holding firm at a price closer to her minimum.
* **Buying from John is the best option.** Given Alice's stubbornness, purchasing from John for $100 provides certainty and avoids further negotiation that might end up costing you even more. You're only $5 over your ideal price, but you're guaranteed to get the product."
