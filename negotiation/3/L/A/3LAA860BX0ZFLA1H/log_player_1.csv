"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob but significantly lower than my minimum value. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates I'm open to discussion and allows Bob to feel comfortable making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting.
* **More room for negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially leading to a better deal.
* **Potential for a higher price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to hold out for a better price, which could encourage him to raise his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This response demonstrates that I am willing to negotiate but not at the price Bob is offering. 
* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum.
* **Finality:** By stating ""final offer,"" I put pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal.  
* **Positive Tone:** While firm, the message remains polite and encourages a response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is only $3,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Time is running out:**  We are already in round 4, and with each round, the risk of losing the deal to John increases.  
* **Potential for future negotiation:** While I would ideally like a higher price, accepting this offer allows me to secure the sale. There's always the possibility of negotiating additional terms or future deals with Bob if the relationship is positive. 

**Overall:** Accepting Bob's offer at this point seems like the best strategy, balancing the need for profit with the risk of losing the deal to John or further lowering the price in subsequent rounds."
