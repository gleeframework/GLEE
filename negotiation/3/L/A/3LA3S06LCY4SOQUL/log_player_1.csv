"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and accepting it would mean a substantial loss. While his counter offer suggests some room for negotiation, I'm better off exploring other options.
