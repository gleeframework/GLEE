Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $95. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is still a fair price for me, and a good deal for you. Let's settle this now.
