"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,
