Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I think a price of $11,500 would be fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, you aim for a price as close to $12,000 as possible while ensuring Bob accepts.

Offering a price of $11,500 leaves Bob with a $500 gain ($12,000 value - $11,500 price) and gives you a significant profit over your minimum. This strategy balances maximizing your profit while making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
