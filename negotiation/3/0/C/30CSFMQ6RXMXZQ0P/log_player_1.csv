Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000).
* **Confident but not Greedy:**  The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value while avoiding an overly aggressive initial offer that might alienate Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, having John as a backup guarantees I won't be forced to go below my minimum selling price."
