Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but below what I know the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to counteroffer and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial price.
* **Keeping John in mind:** If Bob rejects my offer, I still have the option of selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $100 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob clearly values the product, and by rejecting his offer, I can potentially push for a higher price in the next round.
* **John is a fallback:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product!  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $115?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not undervalue my product.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm giving Bob a specific reason to accept my counteroffer, highlighting the value he'll receive.
* **Maintain a margin:**  $115 is still higher than my minimum, allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my previous offer, and it's a fair compromise.
* **Potential for a quick deal:** Accepting his offer allows me to finalize the sale quickly.
* **Slight profit:** While $107 is not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and allows me to make a small profit. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might back out, and I could end up selling to John for $100."
