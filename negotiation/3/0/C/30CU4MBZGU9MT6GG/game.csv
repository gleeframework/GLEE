"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a good profit for you and closer to my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price considering your willingness to pay",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'll counteroffer at $875,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're sticking to your price, but $875,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a fair price considering both our needs, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",825000.0,Bob,6,
