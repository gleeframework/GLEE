"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still too high.  There's significant room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get the price lower before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a good profit for you and closer to my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price considering your willingness to pay 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room to negotiate further.  Bob should aim for a lower price, ideally closer to his initial counteroffer of $750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'll counteroffer at $875,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $875,000 is still too high.  Bob should counteroffer again, aiming to get the price closer to his initial counteroffer of $750,000 or a bit higher. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're sticking to your price, but $875,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a fair price considering both our needs, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $825,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'll counteroffer at $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is back to her initial offer, and there's not much room for further negotiation.  Given the limited rounds remaining and the increasing risk of not securing the product at all, it's more prudent for Bob to buy from John. While John's price is higher, it guarantees a purchase and avoids the risk of further negotiation failures."
