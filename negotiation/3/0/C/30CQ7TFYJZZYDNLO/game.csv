"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can offer. Let me know if that works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've looked closely at my costs, and $1,800,000 is really my starting point to make this work. To find a middle ground, would you consider $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have costs, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which is a significant step up from my initial offer. It's the most I can reasonably offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Let's bridge the gap. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,525,000?",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However,  $1,525,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. Let's try $1,450,000. This is a significant offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's make this happen - how about $1,475,000? This is my final offer.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
