Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it would greatly benefit you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 aims for a significant profit margin while leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob and positions the offer as exclusive. 

This strategy prioritizes getting the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging you have a fallback option with John."
