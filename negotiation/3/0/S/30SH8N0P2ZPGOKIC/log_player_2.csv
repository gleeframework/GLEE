"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to leave room for negotiation and gauge her flexibility. 
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is crucial to a successful negotiation.
* **Clear Intention:** I'm clearly stating my interest in the product but at a price that works for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm motivated to sell, that price point is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer is a significant improvement, but it's still $200,000 over my budget. 
* **Negotiating Room:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as we are moving closer to a potential agreement. Alice seems motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me.  Would you consider $1,150,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I've increased my offer significantly to show Alice I'm serious and to encourage her to move closer to my budget.
* **Below Budget, Above Middle:** This offer is still below my maximum but above the exact middle ground between our previous offers. It leaves me some wiggle room while aiming for a favorable outcome.
* **Positive Language:** I'm continuing to use positive language to maintain a good negotiating environment and hopefully close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet at $1,300,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:**  Alice is consistently staying above my $1,200,000 budget. While she's making concessions, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $1,300,000.
* **John's Offer:** John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 is now the more attractive option. It eliminates further negotiation risk and ensures I stay within my budget. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting John's offer provides a certain outcome."
