{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:** This creates room for negotiation. 
* **Below your minimum value:** You're still getting more than your minimum. 
* **A reasonable starting point:** It signals that you're open to negotiation but still value the product. 

Remember, this is just the first offer.  We'll adjust based on Bob's reaction to get the best possible outcome!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and it's not worth risking getting stuck with a price that's significantly below your minimum.  Let's see if we can get closer to our target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to compromise from your original offer.
* **Stays above your minimum:**  $13,250 is still above your minimum price of $15,000.
* **Offers a specific solution:**  The ""split the difference"" approach makes it easy for Bob to see a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $12,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,750 is closer to our minimum, it's still too low.  Let's make one final counteroffer to see if we can get closer to our target before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,750 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to be at $13,000 to make this work. This is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about buying the product, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other offers."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This final counteroffer:

* **Shows firmness:** You've reached your limit and are prepared to walk away.
* **Is close to your minimum:** $13,000 is only $500 below your minimum.
* **Creates a sense of urgency:** You're emphasizing that this is your final offer.

This approach puts the pressure on Bob to decide.  If he truly wants the product, he'll need to compromise a bit more.  If not, you can confidently move on to John."
