"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $12,750. Can you consider that?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,750 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to be at $13,000 to make this work. This is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about buying the product, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other offers.",13000.0,Alice,5,
