"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is around $8,000 to you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
