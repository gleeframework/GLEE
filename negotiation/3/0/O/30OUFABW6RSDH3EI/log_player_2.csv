"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is $2,000 below your maximum price, making it a good deal. There's no guarantee you'll get a better price in the next round, and buying from John means paying the full $12,000."
