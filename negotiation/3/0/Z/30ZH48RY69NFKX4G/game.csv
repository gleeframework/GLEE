"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth $120 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $107.50 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $110. This product is truly worth it, and I believe you'll find great value in it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $107.50 and $110, so how about $108.75?",108.75,Bob,4,
