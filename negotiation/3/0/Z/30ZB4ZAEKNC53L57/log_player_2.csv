"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll find very valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant decrease from Alice's initial price, but still offers her a profit margin. It demonstrates Bob's interest in the product while also setting a clear limit on his spending."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I think that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he still has room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price.  He has already made a counteroffer, so it's reasonable to assume Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to go to $92.  If we can agree on that, I'll take the product today."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price point.  A $92 price is still a good deal for Alice, as she values the product at $80. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product while also leaving a little room for further negotiation if necessary."
