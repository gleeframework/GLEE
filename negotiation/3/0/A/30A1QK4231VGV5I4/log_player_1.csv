"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum value, but leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price higher than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer remains unchanged, and while it's tempting to take the $12,000, I'm still not willing to accept a price so far below my minimum. There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm going to lower my price to $13,000.  I'm hoping that this shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, and he'll be willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with this price. I'm going to hold out and see if Bob is willing to come up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $12,500. It's a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to lose the deal to John.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire, and with Bob stubbornly refusing to budge, I've decided to cut my losses and sell to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob continuing to lowball me."
