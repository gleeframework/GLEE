"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. By starting high, I can potentially get a better price, while also allowing myself room to make concessions in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I am not willing to let it go for that low of a price, especially since I know I can get at least $1,200,000 from John. I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's try $850,000. That's a considerable discount from my initial offer and still a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a little steep for me. Would you be willing to settle at $725,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still too low for me. I'm not desperate to sell and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I won't settle for anything less than a price that feels fair to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is still a bit below my expectations. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. This price is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product for you, while also allowing me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
