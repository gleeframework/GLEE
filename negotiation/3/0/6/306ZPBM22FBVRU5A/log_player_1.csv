"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $22,000, I'm setting a high anchor.  Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it might influence his counteroffer to be higher than if I started lower.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $22,000 offer provides ample room to negotiate downwards over the remaining rounds while still aiming for a price significantly above $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open, and I can try to guide Bob closer to my desired price range. I'm confident that over the next few rounds, I can negotiate a better deal than selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $18,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? This price reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but not too much:** I'm making a $2,000 concession from my initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong stance. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** By suggesting a price of $20,000, I'm appealing to a sense of fairness and compromise.
* **Reaffirming Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about the product's value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $20,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiations are getting close. While $17,500 is tempting, I believe I can still push for a bit more.  Bob is clearly interested and engaged in the negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a smaller concession in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $19,000.  I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $19,000. I think this is a very fair offer considering the product's quality and what it can do for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  A $1,000 drop from my previous offer shows I'm willing to negotiate but am also getting closer to my bottom line.
* **Highlighting Value Again:**  By reiterating the benefits Bob will receive, I'm reinforcing the product's worth and justifying the price.
* **Creating Urgency:** With the offer at $19,000 and only five rounds remaining, I'm starting to create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to come down, but $19,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $16,500 has dropped significantly and is now too close to John's standing offer of $15,000.  It's unlikely that Bob will dramatically increase his offer in the remaining rounds. 

At this point, the potential gain from continuing to negotiate with Bob is outweighed by the risk of ending up with a deal worse than $15,000 or even having the negotiation fall apart entirely. Accepting John's offer guarantees a $15,000 sale and avoids further time and effort spent on an uncertain negotiation."
