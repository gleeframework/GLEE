"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $175, which is above your maximum budget of $100.  You can get the same product from John for $100, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
