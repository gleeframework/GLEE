"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm looking to save as much as possible, and I'm not sure I can justify spending $100 on this product.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a good price for a product like this, and it gives you a fair saving. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still not convinced it's the best price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $85, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you do that for me?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $85.  I'm still a bit away from that price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and my last offer of $90.  How about $87.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $85. I'd like to make a final offer of $82.50. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",82.5,Bob,6,
