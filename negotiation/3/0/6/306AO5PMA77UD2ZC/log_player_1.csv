I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a good price from Bob. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $120, which is still above my minimum.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

Bob's offer of $105 is better than selling to John for $100. I'll accept his offer."
