"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I believe I can't exceed $10,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,000?  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe $10,000 is the maximum I can afford for this product. Could we possibly meet at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome.  What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've given this some thought and I really appreciate your efforts to meet my budget constraints. I'd like to propose $11,000 as a compromise. I hope this works for you.",11000.0,Bob,6,
