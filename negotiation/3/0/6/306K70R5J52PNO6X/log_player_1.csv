Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John, but lower than my minimum acceptable value. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$75 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150, and even lower than what Bob values the product at. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous offer, but still above Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. This shows willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation while ensuring a profit.  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $85 is close to Bob's valuation of the product, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. At this point, further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better price.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for a guaranteed $150."
