"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit above my target price.  I'm willing to go to $875,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this product is worth every penny, but I'm willing to compromise to get it sold. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",885000.0,Alice,5,
