Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $175, knowing that the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate. If he rejects, I'm prepared to counter and I can always fall back on John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While $110 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm dropping my price to $140. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit from his $110 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him.  While John offers more, I'm running the risk that negotiations with Bob will fall apart, and then I'll have to settle for John's $150.  It's a gamble, but I'm willing to take it for the extra $25."
