{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,200. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,800.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  Let's do $8,900.  I believe this is a fair price that will allow both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to get as close as possible to his desired price without risking Alice walking away.
* A counteroffer of $8,900 is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still being within his budget.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $8,950. It's a small increase, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,950.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $8,950 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $8,900. 
* There are only a few rounds remaining, and the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's close to his target, saving him money compared to buying from John."
