"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $15,000. Considering this, I propose a special introductory offer for you: you can acquire this exceptional product for $14,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a competitive price. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you can gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."
