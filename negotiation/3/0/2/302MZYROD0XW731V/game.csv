"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two offers. How about $13,500 for the product?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. Let's try $12,500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to make a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $14,000 for the product?",14000.0,Alice,5,
