{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:**  By stating ""Let me know what you think,"" I'm indicating that I'm open to negotiating.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me a baseline for acceptable offers. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'm prepared to negotiate or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is too low, he does express interest in the product, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer that is more reasonable, but still higher than his initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a good price, considering the value of the product. Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer in the Middle:**  I'm offering $125, which is midway between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reiterate why my price is justified.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive and encouraging language (""Let's make this work!"") to keep the negotiation friendly.
* **Strategic Approach:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below it.
* **Further Negotiation:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to negotiate.  There's potential for a final agreement closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $150 would be safe, but I believe I can achieve a better outcome through continued negotiation with Bob.

**Next Step:** I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price just above $110, perhaps $115, to try and close the deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's make this final offer: $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product while still getting a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm positioning this as a final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:**  The $115 price is just above Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still being profitable.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness by highlighting that it's a good deal for both parties.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm aiming to close the deal at this price, as further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a rejection from Bob."
