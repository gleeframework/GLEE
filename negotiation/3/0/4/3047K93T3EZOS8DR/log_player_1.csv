Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's lower than my minimum value of $15,000 but still higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, great! I make a profit.
* **Open the door for negotiation:** If he rejects, I can use his counteroffer to better understand his limits and adjust my own pricing.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $15,000 gives me confidence to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach a fair agreement. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This counteroffer offers a compromise. It's still higher than Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while ensuring I don't go too far below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Would you consider $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome. I'm not willing to settle for that price yet, especially with John as a backup buyer. I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still trying to figure out a way to make this work for both of us. $9,750 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,500.  Would you consider $10,000?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to move forward. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground.  It's still a bit higher than Bob's offer but significantly lower than my previous offer.  This shows flexibility while keeping me within a reasonable price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but I don't think I can go any higher. This is my final offer. Can you meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum, it makes more sense to sell to John and ensure I get the best possible price."
