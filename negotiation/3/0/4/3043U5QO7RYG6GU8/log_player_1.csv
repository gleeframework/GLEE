Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will pay $15,000 gives Alice leverage.
* **High Anchor:** The message starts with a price just below Alice's minimum, aiming to anchor Bob's perception of value. 
* **Slight Negotiation Room:**  The offer leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to negotiate, potentially making him feel more in control and likely to accept."
