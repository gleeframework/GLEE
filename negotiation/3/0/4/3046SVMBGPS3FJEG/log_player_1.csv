Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while still exceeding John's offer. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time pressure element, making Bob less likely to counter-offer or stall.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly if he's very keen, potentially increasing your profit. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the highest possible sale price and avoiding the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing you to accept John's lower price."
