"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth significantly more than its market value to me.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $120 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, I must respectfully decline your offer at $85. Considering the product's unique features and high quality, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we consider $95 as a starting point for further discussion?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $90. This is a fair price, considering both our perspectives. Let's see if we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
