"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Given the value I'm looking for, I'd be happy to offer $500000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $700000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700000 is a good offer, but I'm still not convinced it's enough to let the product go. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
