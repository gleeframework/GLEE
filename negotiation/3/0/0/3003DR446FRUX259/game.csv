"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet the $2,250,000 price tag. I've done my research, and I believe the product's value is around $1,500,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up from your initial valuation. It demonstrates you recognize the product's true potential.  While $1,750,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a price that reflects its unique value.  Would you consider $2,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I still think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,750,000 again, but I'm also willing to go a bit lower. How about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to consider $1,850,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's unique nature and potential for your business.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced $1,850,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,725,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1725000.0,Bob,6,
