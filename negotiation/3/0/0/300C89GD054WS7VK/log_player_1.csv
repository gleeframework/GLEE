Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum value ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). It gives him a good deal while still allowing me to make a significant profit. 
* **The Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the value of the product and encouraging Bob to consider it seriously.

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a high offer allows for negotiation and gives me room to make concessions.  It's important to be mindful of Bob's perceived value, as a price too far above his limit will likely lead to rejection. This strategy gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $600,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest in the product and is willing to invest, indicating potential for compromise.
* **Protecting my Value:** Accepting such a low offer would undervalue the product and set a bad precedent for future negotiations.
* **John's Offer:**  I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so rejecting Bob's offer doesn't leave me in a worse position.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $600,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $850,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still represents a compromise.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing my need for a higher price. I'm also framing the offer as a mutually beneficial solution, highlighting the ""great deal"" Bob would still receive.

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** The counteroffer moves me closer to Bob's offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  This price point could be appealing to Bob as it's more than his initial offer but still within a range he might be willing to consider.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:** Continuing the negotiation process keeps the door open for a potential deal while still allowing me to sell to John for $1,200,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $700000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, accepting his offer would result in a huge loss for me.

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting my Value:** My goal is to maximize my profit. Accepting such a low offer would undervalue the product and leave me with a significant financial loss.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.  Selling to John eliminates any risk of losing out on a better deal.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear that Bob and I are not close to agreeing on a price.  Further rounds of negotiation could be time-consuming and unproductive.

Selling to John is the most rational decision, as it guarantees me the best possible outcome in this scenario."
