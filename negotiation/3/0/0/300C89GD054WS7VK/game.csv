"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you consider this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $600000 is too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $700000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",700000.0,Bob,4,
