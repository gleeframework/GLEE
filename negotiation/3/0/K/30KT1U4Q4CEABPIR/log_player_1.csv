This offer starts with a price that's above Bob's estimated value but below my minimum.  It leaves room for negotiation, and it's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to come up in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, even though I know it's likely he won't go much higher.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While we've gotten close, I'm not willing to risk going lower and potentially regretting the deal later.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, so I'm going to take that option."
