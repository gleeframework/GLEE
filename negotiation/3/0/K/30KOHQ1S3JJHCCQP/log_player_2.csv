"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It makes sense to negotiate down, keeping in mind John's offer as a potential fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Aiming for Savings:**  A counteroffer of $10,000 aims to maximize savings while still being within a reasonable range. 
* **John as Leverage:** The option to buy from John at $12,000 provides a good fallback position if negotiations with Alice don't go as planned."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $12,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your ideal price point. There's no need to negotiate further since you've reached the same price John is offering. Accepting now guarantees you get the product at your target price."
