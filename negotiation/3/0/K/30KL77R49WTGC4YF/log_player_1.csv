{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,999,999.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1999999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you and Bob, and you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage to aim high initially. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and potential for negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product at your minimum price provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose anything.

While this initial offer is high, it allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. Remember, the goal is to maximize profit, and this strategy gives you the best chance to do so."
