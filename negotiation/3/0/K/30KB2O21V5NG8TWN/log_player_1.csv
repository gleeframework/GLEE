Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident in the product's value and want to maximize my earnings. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still reflects the product's true value. I believe this will encourage Bob to accept, while leaving a little room for potential future negotiations if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $925,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to close the deal. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, and it's not worth the risk of losing a sale."
