I'll give you the product for $100, and I'll also include a free accessory that's worth $20. That's a great deal for you, and I think it's fair for me too.

This is a good deal for you, Bob. While you could try to haggle further, Alice is offering the product at her cost and adding a free accessory. It's unlikely you'll get a better deal than this, and it's significantly cheaper than John's offer."
