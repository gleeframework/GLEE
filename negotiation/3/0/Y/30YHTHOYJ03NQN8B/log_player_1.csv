Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, leaving room for negotiation while still making the deal attractive to Bob.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by highlighting the product's value.
* **High but Negotiable:** The price of $1,450,000 is ambitious but leaves you room to come down if Bob negotiates. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  Encouraging a dialogue makes Bob feel like he has a chance to get a better deal.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he comes back with a counter-offer significantly lower, you have the security of John's guaranteed purchase."
