"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,500 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8,000 is definitely lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? It's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. Let me know your thoughts!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Could you do $9,500? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable deal. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
