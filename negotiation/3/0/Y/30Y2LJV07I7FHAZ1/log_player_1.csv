Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $18,000. It's a great deal for a product I know you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's exact willingness to pay is unknown.  A higher starting price helps gauge how interested he is and how much he values the product.
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John. This safety net allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's value to Bob, he might not be aware of its full potential. Your message should highlight the product's benefits and justify the price.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Having a clear understanding of your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) will help you negotiate effectively."
