Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer before I consider other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly.

This strategy balances ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
