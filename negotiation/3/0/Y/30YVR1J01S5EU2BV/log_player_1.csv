Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values the product at $800,000, so a $1 million offer leaves room for negotiation while still giving you a good profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to take $1,200,000 from John, so this offer gives you a cushion if Bob doesn't meet your expectations.
* **It's a clear opening:** It sets a firm price and invites Bob to engage in negotiation.

Remember,  this is just the first step. You need to be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum of $1,200,000.  You have a strong alternative with John, so there's no need to rush into a deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's closer to my expectations, I'm still looking for a bit more.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **It shows flexibility:** You're willing to compromise, but not too much.
* **It's a reasonable midpoint:**  It's exactly halfway between your last offer and Bob's.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're comfortable with this price, but you're also ready to walk away if needed.

This counteroffer shows Bob you're serious about a deal but also willing to stick to your principles. This approach can potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to move closer. However, based on my financial situation, I can't agree to $975,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $975,000. You've already established a strong negotiating position by demonstrating flexibility and holding firm on your bottom line. 

While selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, there are a few reasons to accept Bob's offer:

* **Minimizing risk:**  You've already invested time in negotiations with Bob.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a failed deal.
* **Building a relationship:** A successful deal with Bob could lead to future business opportunities.
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting the offer allows you to move on to other projects or opportunities.

Overall, accepting Bob's offer presents a good balance between maximizing your profit and minimizing risk and effort."
