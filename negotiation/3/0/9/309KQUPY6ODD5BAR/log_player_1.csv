Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $6,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a price closer to my minimum of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply not feasible. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. How about $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a touch high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, I still need to get a higher price to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to negotiate further, but $7,250 is still too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,250 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to $8,000.  Let's try $7,750.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 7750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to make a deal, and so am I. How about $7,500? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While $7,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $7,600 to make this deal work for me.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 7600}
