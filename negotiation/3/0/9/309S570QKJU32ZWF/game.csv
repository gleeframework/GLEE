"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is truly significant, and $950,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll see a strong return on this investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
