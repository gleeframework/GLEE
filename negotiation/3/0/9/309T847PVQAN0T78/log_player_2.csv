"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still too high.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. You have 10 rounds, and even if Alice rejects your counteroffer, you have time to negotiate further. Buying from John is always an option, but it's best to exhaust negotiation with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would still leave a substantial profit for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is moving closer to your desired price, but $950,000 is still above your ideal range. You've successfully lowered the price by $50,000, demonstrating your negotiating skills.  You can likely get closer to your ideal price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This would allow us both to make a good deal, and we can finally close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 925000}
