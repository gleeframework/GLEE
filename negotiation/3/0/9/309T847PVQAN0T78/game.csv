"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you.  Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would still leave a substantial profit for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This would allow us both to make a good deal, and we can finally close this transaction.",925000.0,Bob,4,
