"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I think the product's value is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still too high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $95.  If we can meet in the middle, I'm ready to make a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'll meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $105 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $100, Bob. I'll make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $107.50.",107.5,Alice,7,
