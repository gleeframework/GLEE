"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Considering the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects its potential benefit and allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is still fair and reasonable, given the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference and settle on $1050000. This price is fair and allows us both to make a profitable transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1080000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
