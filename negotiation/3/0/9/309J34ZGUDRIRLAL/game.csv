,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 just isn't enough for me. How about we settle on $10,000? That's a good price for you and a fair price for me, and I think we can close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
