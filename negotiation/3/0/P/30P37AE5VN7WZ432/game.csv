"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet all your needs and expectations. I believe it's worth more than $80 to you. Let's start our negotiation at this price: $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting we meet closer to my initial proposal. How about $105? This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while moving closer to my original asking price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, so I'd like to offer $97.50. Can you consider this revised offer?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. Considering your latest offer, I would like to suggest $102.5 as my counteroffer. This brings us closer to my original asking price while still providing value for both of us.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $97.50. I'd like to make a revised offer of $98.25, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",98.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued efforts to reach an agreement, Bob. I've considered your latest offer and would like to propose $100.50 as my counteroffer. This maintains a reasonable distance from my initial asking price while being closer to your most recent proposal.",100.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a revised offer of $99.25, which is a slight decrease from your latest offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",99.25,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience, Bob. I've given this some further thought and am willing to consider $99.75 as my counteroffer. This brings us closer together while still respecting the value I place on the product.",99.75,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a revised offer of $99.00, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80.",99.0,Bob,10,
