"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. If you're still not comfortable, I have other interested buyers.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. If you're not willing to accept this, I may need to move on to another seller.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between $11000 and $12000, which is $11500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
