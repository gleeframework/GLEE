Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still less than what I could get from John. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could sell to John for $150, I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140. This is still above what Bob is willing to pay, but it's a compromise that's closer to my minimum price.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  While Bob has come up to $130, it's still below my minimum price of $150. John is offering me my minimum, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob. It's more certain to get my minimum price by selling to John."
