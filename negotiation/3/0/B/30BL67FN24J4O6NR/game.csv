"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get at least $1,600,000 for the product.  What do you think about that?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, let's try to find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.  Let's make this deal happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,425,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me here.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
