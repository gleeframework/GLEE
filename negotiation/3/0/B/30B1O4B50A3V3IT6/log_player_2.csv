"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $9,200. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price range. There are 10 rounds, so Bob can afford to reject and negotiate for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $8,500, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 was a stretch, but I can do $9,050. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 7

# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about making this deal happen. I'm willing to make one more concession.
