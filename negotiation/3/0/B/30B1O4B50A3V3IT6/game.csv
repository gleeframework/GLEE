"I understand you're looking to pay closer to $8,500, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 was a stretch, but I can do $9,050. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. What do you think?",9050.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,050 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8,875. This price would be fair for both of us and allow me to close this deal. What do you think?",8875.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about making this deal happen. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,050 was too high, but I can do $9,075. It's a small step up, but I think it's worth it to get this deal done. What do you think?",9075.0,Alice,7,
