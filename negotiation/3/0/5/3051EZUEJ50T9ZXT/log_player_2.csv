"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, it's not a great deal. I want to see if I can get a better price. By rejecting, I can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $80? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
