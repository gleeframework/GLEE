"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's valuation, aiming to maximize my profit. I'm confident that we can negotiate a mutually acceptable price within the 10 rounds, but I'm always willing to walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $14,500.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's slightly lower than my ideal price, it's still a profitable deal, and we're getting closer to a final agreement.  There's always a risk that we won't be able to reach a better deal in the remaining rounds, and selling to John for $12,000 would be a significant loss.  It's important to balance risk and reward in negotiations."
