"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,150,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its value to me. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a competitive offer considering its potential.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable paying $900,000 for the product. This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's a fair price for you considering your value and a good deal for me.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still substantial.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
