# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you!

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,500.  I'm confident this would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $10,250. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'll go down to $9,750. It's a good price, and I think we can both be happy with it.

I'm getting close, but it's still too high.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer.  I can get the product for $8,000, which is within my budget, and I don't want to risk continuing to negotiate and losing the opportunity."
