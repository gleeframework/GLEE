"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1000000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1050000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $975000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1025000.  That's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to at least get $1010000 for this product. It's a fair price, and it's the last compromise I can offer.  Let's close this deal!",1010000.0,Alice,7,
