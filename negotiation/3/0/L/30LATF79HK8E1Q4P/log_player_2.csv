Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still looking for a good deal. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I'll offer it to you for $13,500. It's a fair price, considering the value the product has for you

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500, and it's better to secure the product from John at the desired price point than risk the negotiation failing."
