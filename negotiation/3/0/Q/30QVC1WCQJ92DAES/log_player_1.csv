Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond your initial assessment. However, I do have other interested buyers, and this offer stands for a limited time."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows you to potentially secure a price significantly above Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Anchoring:**  A high initial offer can anchor Bob's perception of the product's value, making him more receptive to a slightly lower counteroffer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:**  While this is a starting point, be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  If he outright rejects the initial offer, you can gauge his interest and adjust the price accordingly, moving closer to his $10,000 valuation while keeping your $15,000 safety net with John in mind."
