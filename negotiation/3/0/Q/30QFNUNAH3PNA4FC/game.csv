"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $1,050,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,050,000 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,250,000.  This price still provides you with a good value, and it allows me to get closer to my target. Let's make a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle on $1,150,000? It seems like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
