"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product. 
* Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's offer of $150.
* However, you want to save as much money as possible. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or find another seller with a better deal."
