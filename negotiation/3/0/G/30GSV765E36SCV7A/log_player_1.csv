Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect that. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,100,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still believe that $1,050,000 is a fair price considering my financial situation. I would like to stick to this figure if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $1,050,000, but we know the product is worth significantly more to him. There's still room to negotiate, and walking away with $1,050,000 is better than John's $1,000,000 offer, but we can likely do better."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your firm stance on the price.  While I believe this product is worth more, I value our developing business relationship.  Let's settle this - I'll come down to $1,075,000, and we can close the deal today. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counter-offer achieves several things:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** We're moving closer to Bob's price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Highlights the product's value:** We reiterate its worth without being too forceful.
* **Creates a sense of urgency:** ""Close the deal today"" implies it's a time-sensitive offer.
* **Appeals to long-term relationship:**  This positions the deal as the start of a potentially beneficial partnership.

This offer gives Bob a final chance to secure a good deal before we potentially move closer to our fallback option (John's offer)."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,060,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

It's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,060,000 is a strong profit margin, significantly exceeding our minimum and John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments above $1,060,000.  The time and effort might not be worth the risk of losing Bob entirely.
* **Bob's ""Final"" Signal:** By stating ""final counteroffer,"" Bob signals he's unlikely to move much higher. 

Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially jeopardizing the sale altogether."
