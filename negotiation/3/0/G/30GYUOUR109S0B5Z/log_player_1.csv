I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,500 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of $14,500."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000? It's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $13,000 is still a decent price, I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my desired $14,000. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can meet in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  How about we settle on $13,500?  I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting close to the end of our rounds and $13,200 is a decent price for me.  It's better than selling to John for $12,000."
