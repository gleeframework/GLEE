Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to sell it for $135. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $150, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying comfortably above your $120 minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing his willingness to pay a higher price. 
* **Clear and Direct:**  The offer is straightforward, making it easy for Bob to understand and respond.

This approach aims to maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
