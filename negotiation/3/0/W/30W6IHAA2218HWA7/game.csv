,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $120. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That feels like a fair deal to me.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
