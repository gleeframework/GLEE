"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating at that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than its true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference and meet at $14,500.  I'm very interested in this product and want to make this deal happen.",14500.0,Bob,4,
