"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above my maximum budget of $12,000. I need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating at that price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than its true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's a step in the right direction, I'll need to continue negotiating for a lower price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always buy the product from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference and meet at $14,500.  I'm very interested in this product and want to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 14500}
