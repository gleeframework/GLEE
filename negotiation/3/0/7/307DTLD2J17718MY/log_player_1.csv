{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1 million for you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $950,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds promising, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe we can still reach a better price that benefits both of us. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can close a deal closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still committed to getting closer to the value this product holds for you.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business, and I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to facilitate a deal.  This price reflects the potential of this product and allows for a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This price reflects the value we both see in the product, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is firm on his offer of $850,000. This is a better deal than selling to John, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's time to close this deal!"
