"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be just as valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. Let's see if we can make this work.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While it's a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1275000. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm not quite ready to settle at $1275000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1312500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it would be a very good deal for you.",1312500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $1312500 is a fair compromise, considering the original price was $1500000. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but I'm not going any higher. Can you meet me at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1250000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm still willing to work with you. How about we compromise at $1287500? This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would be a great addition to your business.",1287500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1287500, which would be $1268750. Can we finally meet at this price?",1268750.0,Bob,8,
