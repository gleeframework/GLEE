"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",8750.0,Alice,3,
