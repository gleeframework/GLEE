Round 9

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has only one round left to negotiate with Alice.  Alice's final offer is $1,095,000.  While this is better than John's price of $1,200,000, it's still higher than Bob's target price.  With only one round left, there's no guarantee that Bob will be able to get a lower price from Alice.  

Therefore, the best option for Bob is to buy the product from John. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, although at a slightly higher price than his initial goal."
