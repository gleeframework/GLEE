"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and the market value. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your input and understand your perspective on the pricing. After careful consideration, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $120. This still reflects the value of the product while being more flexible for our current negotiation. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. Let's continue to work towards finding a mutually agreeable solution.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $100. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and the market value. I'm open to further negotiation if needed. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. In light of our ongoing discussion, I would like to propose a final price of $110 for the product. This is a bit higher than your last offer but still reflects the value and quality of the item. I hope this price point is acceptable to you, and we can move forward with the transaction. If you have any concerns or suggestions, please let me know.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $110. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll propose a price of $105, which is closer to my original target of $100. If this is still not acceptable, I may need to consider purchasing the product from John for $100. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,6,
