Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll end up with a price closer to your ideal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and gives you information about his potential price ceiling. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is below your minimum acceptable price of $80. While his counter-offer indicates interest, you have a guaranteed offer from John at your minimum. It makes sense to negotiate further and see if Bob is willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $70 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By countering with $95, you're signaling a willingness to negotiate while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. This classic tactic can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You haven't revealed your absolute bottom line, giving you room to negotiate further if Bob rejects this counteroffer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to settle the deal quickly at a price favorable to you while avoiding a stalemate that might lead you back to John's $80 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my maximum budget for this product.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now matched your minimum acceptable price of $80. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as:

* **You've reached your goal:** You aimed to earn as much as possible, and Bob's offer matches what John is offering.
* **Further negotiation is risky:** Pushing for more might lead Bob to walk away, leaving you with the $80 offer from John anyway. 
* **Time value:**  Closing the deal now saves time and avoids potential delays if you were to continue negotiating."
