{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your budget, and you're aiming to save as much money as possible. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the lower price (value to you) while leaving room for compromise.
* **Realistic Target:** While $1,100,000 is still above your ideal price, it's a starting point for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1100000 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $1250000? This would still leave you with a good deal while ensuring I can fairly compensate for the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price range, but it's still above your maximum. Since you have 10 rounds, there's room to negotiate further. Rejecting her offer allows you to try to get closer to your target price of $1,200,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while you get a solid price for your product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Middle Ground:** This counteroffer is a clear compromise, aiming to meet Alice halfway.
