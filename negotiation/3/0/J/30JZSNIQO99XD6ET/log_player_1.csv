Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $1,250,000? This would still leave you with a good deal while ensuring I can fairly compensate for the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1200000. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while you get a solid price for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have liked to get a bit more,  $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price and a fair deal for both of us.  It's better than going through more rounds of negotiation and potentially risking a deal with Bob entirely."
