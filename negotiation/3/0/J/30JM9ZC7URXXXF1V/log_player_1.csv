"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000.  I believe this price reflects its true value and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  Phrasing the offer as reflecting the ""true value"" and potential ""benefits"" aims to anchor Bob's perception around a higher price point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves significant room for negotiation while still being substantially above both your minimum and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it will bring me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. You have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand the value you see in the product, but I need to be realistic about its worth. How about we meet halfway and settle for $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving significantly from the initial offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob somewhere in the middle. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** While compromising, this counteroffer still keeps the price well above Bob's initial offer and your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Clear Justification:**  Framing the counteroffer as ""meeting halfway"" provides a simple and seemingly fair rationale for the proposed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $1,600,000. This is now above John's standing offer of $1,500,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away altogether. Accepting this offer secures you a profit above your guaranteed alternative and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
