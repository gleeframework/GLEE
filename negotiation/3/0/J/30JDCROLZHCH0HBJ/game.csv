"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1200000 is tempting, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1300000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still gives you a significant profit margin.  Let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $1250000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1275000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
