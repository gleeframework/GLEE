"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also open to negotiating down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I can sell to John for $12,000, I'd rather try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still a good price for me, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and meet Bob halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low and I'm concerned that if I keep negotiating, he may keep going lower. I don't want to risk selling for a lower price than John is offering, especially since I have 10 rounds to close a deal with Bob."
