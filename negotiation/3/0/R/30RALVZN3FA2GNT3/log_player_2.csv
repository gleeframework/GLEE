"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.** 
* **You can do better.** You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or explore your other option (buying from John). 

**Next steps:**

* You should counteroffer Alice with a lower price.  
* You should also consider your risk tolerance.  If you're willing to risk a deal with Alice falling through, you could try a lower counteroffer. If you want to be more certain, you could offer closer to her price."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **This offer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still higher than Alice's value of the product.**  This leaves room for negotiation but also demonstrates your willingness to pay a fair price.
* **The message is friendly and positive,** indicating your continued interest in the product. 
* **You're stating your maximum price**, which clarifies your position."
