Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering the product at $19,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Profit:** If Bob accepts this initial high price, you make a significant profit beyond your minimum acceptable price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still room to negotiate downwards, closer to his perceived value of $10,000 while staying above your minimum.

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit. However, setting the price too high might discourage Bob from negotiating at all. It's a balancing act between ambition and the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
