"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,650,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and still have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,450,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to accept anything below $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can push for a higher price in the remaining rounds. I also have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to make a deal with Bob if it's not beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This is my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,475,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still refusing to meet my minimum price of $1,500,000. We've only got 4 rounds left, and I'm not sure I can convince him to go higher.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk getting less from Bob or losing the deal altogether."
