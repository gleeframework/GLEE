# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price for both parties. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still slightly higher than what you're comfortable with. There's room for further negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and lower the price further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing $850000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both parties. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above your budget.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000, it's the most financially sensible choice.  Further negotiation with Alice risks going over your budget, and you're guaranteed a lower price with John."
