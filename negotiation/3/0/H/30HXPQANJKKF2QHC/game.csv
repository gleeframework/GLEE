"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique features you mentioned, $999000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while staying within my financial limitations. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price for both parties. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $875000 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to offer. To make this work, I'm willing to pay $825000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it and my financial limitations. I believe it's a win-win situation where we both get a good deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing $850000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both parties. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
