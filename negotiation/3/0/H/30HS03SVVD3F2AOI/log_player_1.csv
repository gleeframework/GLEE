{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for bargaining. I'm confident Bob will see value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's still a great deal for you considering the value this product holds."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $10,000 is a good compromise and still significantly higher than my minimum.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell him the product."
