"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's a bit closer to Alice's value of $8,000.  A counteroffer of $8,500 is a reasonable starting point. It shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to see if he can get Alice closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her previous offer and still significantly above Bob's target price. Bob wants to see if he can get a better deal, especially with a few rounds left.  He's willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially save a few hundred dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Bob has a few more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price. With the option to buy from John at $10,000, Bob has a safety net and can afford to be more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now increasing his offer to $9,000.  This is a significant increase from his previous offer and represents a greater willingness to compromise. He's nearing his budget, but with only a few rounds left, Bob is taking a calculated risk.  He's trying to find a sweet spot that balances saving money with the likelihood of getting a deal before he has to resort to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is only $500 less than John's offer.  With only one round left, Bob has very little leverage to negotiate further. It's not worth risking getting no deal at all just to save $500. It's more prudent for Bob to buy from John and avoid the potential of a stalemate."
