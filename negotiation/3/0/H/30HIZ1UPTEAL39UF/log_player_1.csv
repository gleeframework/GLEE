"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I acknowledge your offer, the true value of this product is far greater. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I still think $1,450,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make a profit on this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 
Explanation: We are still well above John's offer.  There's room to negotiate further and aim higher than $1,100,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate that you're trying to find a middle ground here.  Let's make this work. How about $1,275,000?  That's me coming down significantly, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,275,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I'm getting close to my target, and I'd like to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Explanation: While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we are now at a significant profit margin above John's standing offer. Accepting at $1,150,000 locks in a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
