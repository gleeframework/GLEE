"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable amount. I'll try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this number."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still below my minimum, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  Accepting this offer will allow me to close the deal and secure a good profit."
