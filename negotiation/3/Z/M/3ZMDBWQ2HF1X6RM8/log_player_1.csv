"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired selling price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards while still securing a favorable outcome. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""incredible potential and value"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By stating it's a ""starting point for discussions,"" you signal your willingness to negotiate and hear Bob's perspective.
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping the John offer ($1,200,000) in mind provides a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still substantially lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's ample space for negotiation. By rejecting, you signal that you're serious about a higher price and encourage Bob to improve his offer.
* **John as Leverage:** You have the security of John's offer, which provides leverage.  You're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true market value and my minimum acceptable price. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** The message starts by recognizing Bob's counteroffer, fostering a more collaborative negotiation environment.
* **Firm but Fair:** While stating that $850,000 is too low, you're making a significant concession by reducing your price by $50,000.
* **Justification:** You're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The tone suggests you're looking for a win-win solution, encouraging Bob to move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's find a way to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to your target, but still falls short of your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has significantly increased his offer. This suggests there's room for him to move higher. 
* **Time Consideration:** You've used 4 of your 10 rounds. While time isn't critical yet, you want to make sure you're progressing towards a price you'll accept or consider switching to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To show I'm equally committed to getting this done, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession and my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you're creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make his best move.
* **Justified Concession:** You're making another significant concession ($50,000), but emphasizing it's a final move to demonstrate firmness.
* **Psychological Price Point:** $1,000,000 is a strong psychological price point. While still below your minimum, it might be appealing enough to Bob to close the deal. 
* **John Option Remains:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you still have the option of accepting John's offer, so you're not risking a loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still looking to save more. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I believe this offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 indicates he's unlikely to meet your $1,000,000 ""final offer.""  He decreased his offer despite you stating it was final, suggesting he may be trying to exploit your potential eagerness to close the deal.
* **Significant Loss:**  Accepting $900,000 would mean a $300,000 loss compared to John's offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees you the full $1,200,000, maximizing your profit and minimizing risk.
* **Time Saved:** By accepting John's offer, you avoid potentially lengthy and fruitless negotiations with Bob. 

**It's important to recognize when to walk away from a negotiation, especially when you have a strong alternative. While further negotiation with Bob might yield a slightly higher offer, the potential gain is likely not worth the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer.**"
