"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high with $2,000,000. This is a bold opening that gives me room to negotiate downwards.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest. 

* **Why $2,000,000?** It's a significant markup from my minimum price, which will hopefully incentivize Bob to negotiate. 
* **Why not start lower?**  Starting too low might make me seem desperate, and Bob might be tempted to lowball me.

I'm also prepared to use John as a backup option, knowing I can get $1,500,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell right away.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 

**Why not accept?**  

* Accepting right away might signal to Bob that I'm willing to settle for the bare minimum, and he might be less willing to offer more in future rounds.

**Why not sell to John?**

*  While selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, I want to exhaust all negotiation options with Bob.  

**Next steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in round 3, aiming to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000. This shows a willingness to compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. 

**Why $1,800,000?**

* It's a reasonable middle ground between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.
* It demonstrates that I'm flexible but not desperate to sell.

**Why not lower further?** 

*  Dropping too much might make me seem desperate and could encourage Bob to make even lower offers in future rounds.

I'm confident that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to accept it. 

* **Why not accept?**  I believe I can potentially get more by continuing to negotiate.  Bob is clearly interested in the product and I'm confident I can push him higher. 
* **Why not sell to John?**  I'm still within the early rounds of negotiations, and there's no reason to rush into selling to John when I have a better chance of getting a higher price from Bob.

**Next steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in round 5, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $1,700,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still within my desired range. 

**Why $1,700,000?**

* It's a good middle ground between Bob's offer of $1,600,000 and my previous counteroffer of $1,800,000.
* This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my initial stance.

**Why not lower further?**

* Lowering too drastically might lead Bob to believe he can push for an even lower price in the future. 

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired range, I'm still not ready to accept.  I'm determined to push for a slightly higher price, especially since I'm only halfway through the negotiations.

* **Why not accept?** Accepting at this point might make Bob believe he can get a better deal with further offers. I'm confident I can get him to come closer to my desired price.
* **Why not sell to John?** Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I see the potential for a higher price from Bob with a few more rounds.

**Next steps:**

In round 7, I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming to get closer to $1,700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1680000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $1,680,000. This is a small increase from Bob's latest offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a price closer to my desired range.

**Why $1,680,000?**

* It's a small but meaningful increase from Bob's offer of $1,650,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* This price is still within my desired range and shows that I'm not settling for the minimum.

**Why not accept Bob's offer?** 

*  I believe there's still room for a slightly higher price, especially with several rounds remaining.

By taking this approach, I hope to encourage Bob to raise his offer even further and get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,660,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,660,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Closing the Deal:**  We're close to a mutually agreeable price, and it's better to secure a sale than risk losing a deal altogether. 
* **Time Pressure:** Two rounds is not much time to negotiate further.  If Bob rejects my next offer, I'll be forced to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Small Difference:** The difference between $1,660,000 and my desired price is relatively small. 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price,  $1,660,000 is a good result, and I'm comfortable closing the deal."
