Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the deal open for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price point of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this will be acceptable to Bob, allowing us to close the deal without risking losing him altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is higher than John's and is now closer to my minimum price. It's time to accept his offer and secure the sale.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, but the risk of losing Bob outweighs the potential gain."
