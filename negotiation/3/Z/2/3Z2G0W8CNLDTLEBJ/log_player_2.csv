"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not worth accepting at this stage. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget as a counteroffer. This sets a clear boundary and puts pressure on Alice to compromise. If she rejects this, I'll have a better understanding of her bottom line and can adjust accordingly in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly above my budget. I can still potentially negotiate a better price. I want to see if she's willing to come down further. Also, I want to avoid locking myself into a price that's still higher than what I'm willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate, but her offer is still too high. I'm increasing my counteroffer by $100,000, which is a compromise, but still keeps me below my budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm not comfortable going beyond my limit, and there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further.  If she doesn't, I can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently lowered her price, demonstrating a desire to close a deal. I'm increasing my offer by another $50,000, showing I'm serious about making a deal while still keeping my offer below my maximum budget. This is a good compromise and I believe it's a fair price given the progress we've made."
