"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'll gauge his interest with a high initial offer. If he rejects, I can then start negotiating down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I'll reject and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $900,000, which is still a significant profit for me and closer to my desired price.  This should signal to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is finally above my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
