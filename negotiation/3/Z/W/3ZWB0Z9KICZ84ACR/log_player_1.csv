Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're already securing a profit of $250,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for Bob to counteroffer without you feeling pressured to accept a low price.
* **It demonstrates confidence:** A strong opening offer shows you value your product and are not desperate to sell. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response, and you have the option to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than your desired profit, but it's still above your minimum acceptable price. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product and am willing to consider $1,400,000. However, I would like to propose a price of $1,380,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,380,000 is very close to your desired price and still allows you to make a significant profit. Accepting this offer is the best decision, as further negotiation might not result in a higher price, and selling to John would be less profitable."
