{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where:

* **It's beneficial to Bob:** He's still getting a good deal, saving $3,000 from what it's worth to him. 
* **It's profitable for you:** It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.

This approach allows for some room to negotiate without immediately risking the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than $8,000, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer of $12,000 and less than the product's worth to Bob.  

Rejecting the offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** You show that you're not desperate and willing to accept any price.
* **Counteroffer strategically:** You can come back with a slightly lower price, bridging the gap. 
* **Test Bob's commitment:** Seeing how he responds to your counteroffer will reveal how serious he is about purchasing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for the product. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the target:**  $9,500 is very close to your target price of $10,500.
* **Time and Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely or wasting time.
* **Potential for compromise:**  You can always try to negotiate a few hundred dollars lower if Bob isn't happy with the price. 

It's a good decision to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
