"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm eager to move forward with the purchase.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. I'm eager to reach an agreement and move forward with the sale.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1350000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm ready to meet you halfway.  I'm willing to offer $1300000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
