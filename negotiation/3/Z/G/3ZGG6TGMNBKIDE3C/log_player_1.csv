Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a steal at $180. It's a fantastic deal!"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do this for around $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $180 is a fair starting point considering its value, I'm willing to come down to $130.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $130 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $80?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $105 is close, I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Could you do $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a price I find acceptable, it's unlikely he'll reach $100 within the remaining rounds.  At this point, accepting John's offer of $100 is the best way to maximize my profit and avoid the risk of Bob's negotiations falling through."
