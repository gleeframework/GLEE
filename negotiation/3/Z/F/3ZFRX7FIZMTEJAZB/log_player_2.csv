"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both of them to find a price they're happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum acceptable price.  It shows Bob is serious about buying but also trying to get the best deal.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes the ""fair price"" aspect and highlights how this deal would be beneficial for both parties.
* **Opens the Door for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still setting a clear expectation of what Bob is willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Better than John:** Alice's offer of $9,500 is still better than buying from John for $12,000. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** Alice has already moved from her initial $10,000 offer.  Accepting this offer represents a fair compromise and keeps the negotiation from potentially dragging on.
* **Risk of Further Rejection:** While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and further negotiation could become unproductive. 

It's important to remember that the goal is to save money, and accepting this offer still achieves that objective."
