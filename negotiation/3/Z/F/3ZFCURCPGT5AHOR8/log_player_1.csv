"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this offer."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression you believe in the product's high value. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** By starting significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, we can immediately assess his level of interest and flexibility.  
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000, so we are not desperate to make a deal with Bob below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  We started high, and he's demonstrating a willingness to move from his perceived value of $1,200,000. There's room to negotiate further. We're aiming to secure a price closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation. While your offer is closer to the mark, the value of this product is incredibly high, and I can't justify going below $1,900,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a smaller concession this round ($100,000) compared to Bob's previous move ($200,000). This signals that we're getting closer to our bottom line but are still willing to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to Bob, anchoring our price to its benefits rather than just a number.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By staying above $1,800,000, we're maintaining pressure on Bob to increase his offer while staying above our safety net with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but Bob's offer is still below our psychological threshold. We've only used four rounds, and we're making progress.  It's worth pushing a little further to see if we can get closer to $1,800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $1,825,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."", 
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer splits the difference between our previous offer ($1,900,000) and his last counteroffer ($1,750,000). It signals a strong desire to close the deal but maintains a price above our safety net. 
* **Urgency and Collaboration:**  The language emphasizes finding a solution together and implies a degree of urgency without being overly aggressive. This can encourage Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground, Alice. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a price of $1,775,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob is now very close to our acceptable range (above our $1,500,000 safety net).  A difference of $25,000 is not worth risking the deal at this stage.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging out negotiations further could make Bob less willing to compromise. Accepting now shows we're willing to finalize the deal and value his time.
* **Strong Outcome:** We've secured a price significantly higher than Bob's initial perceived value ($1,200,000). This is a successful negotiation outcome."
