"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's much higher than my budget and even her own valuation. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $80 is quite a bit below my minimum.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still too high for me. It seems like there's room for negotiation. I'll try to nudge her closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $130 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $115 for this.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my range, but $115 is still a bit more than I want to spend. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can get her closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $105? That's a significant jump for me, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}"
