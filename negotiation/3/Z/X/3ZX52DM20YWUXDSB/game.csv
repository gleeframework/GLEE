"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $80 is quite a bit below my minimum.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $130 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $115 for this.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $105? That's a significant jump for me, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",105.0,Bob,6,
