"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I think the product is worth more than $1400000. I'm offering it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1600000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I still think the product is worth more than $1600000. I'm offering it to you for $1700000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1650000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I hope you can consider it.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $1650000, Bob! However, I still think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $1750000. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",1750000.0,Alice,7,
