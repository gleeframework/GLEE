"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,600,000? This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still leaving some room for you to negotiate. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust your offer, Alice. While I understand your need for a profit, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget.
