```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much wiggle room there is. This leaves me space to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $100 limit."

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm happy with. I'll reject and counteroffer again."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think."",

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but I believe there's still room for Alice to come down further. It's worth risking another counteroffer to try to get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the effort to find a good price, Alice.  Could you do $78? I think that's a very reasonable offer."",

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has met her own valuation of the product.  There is no more room for negotiation at this point without being unfair to the seller. This is a good deal and I'll take it."
