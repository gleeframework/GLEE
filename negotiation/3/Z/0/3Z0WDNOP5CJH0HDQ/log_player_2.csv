"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 7200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is a good compromise and represents a significant savings compared to John's price.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and potentially making a counteroffer closer to her original price is high.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible option."
