"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $7,000?"",

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and keeps us well below our $10,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your offer, the product is quite valuable and $7,000 is too low for me. Could you do $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate before reaching our walk-away point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?"",

}

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Alice's Value:** We know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. This offer aims to secure the product at her perceived value.
* **Strong Position:** We're still comfortably below our $10,000 maximum, giving us leverage. 
* **Clean & Direct:**  Offering a clean, round number simplifies the negotiation and can make it easier for Alice to accept."
