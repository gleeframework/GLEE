"Hi Alice,  Thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,200,000 represents the product's full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  This offer reflects the significant value this product brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a substantial offer considering my constraints and the product's value to me.  Let's try to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
