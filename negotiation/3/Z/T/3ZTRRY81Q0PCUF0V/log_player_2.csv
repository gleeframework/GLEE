"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe you might find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $130.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $130 is less than Bob's maximum, it's still higher than Alice's minimum. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'd be happy to pay $115 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price closer to Alice's minimum.  Offering $115 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate, but it's still a fair price considering Bob's maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my original price. Would you consider $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $125 is still higher than Bob's desired price, but it's getting closer.  There's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  Bob is motivated to get the best price possible and is not in a rush to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your original price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $120?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to meet Alice in the middle. Offering $120 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. This offer is a reasonable compromise that might lead to a successful deal."
