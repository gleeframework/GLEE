"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $8,000 to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,200. This is as close as I can get to meeting you halfway. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,5,
