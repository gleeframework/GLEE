Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're starting above your minimum price of $1,200,000, ensuring you won't lose money.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The price is lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him a reason to negotiate. 
* **It shows good faith:** A reasonable starting offer sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

Keep in mind, the key is to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping Bob engaged. You don't want to start too high and scare him off, but you also don't want to undervalue yourself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is lower than your minimum price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer since it's close to the minimum, you can potentially get a better price. 

* **You have leverage:** Bob's willingness to negotiate means he wants the product, giving you leverage.
* **John is a safety net:** You can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations fail, so there's no immediate risk in rejecting Bob's offer. 

**Next step:** You'll send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between your desired price and his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?  It's a fair compromise that still allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridge the gap:**  This counteroffer is halfway between your previous offer of $1,450,000 and Bob's offer of $1,300,000.
* **Show flexibility:**  It shows that you're willing to negotiate and compromise. 
* **Maintain a decent profit:**  $1,375,000 is still well above your minimum price of $1,200,000, ensuring you make a good profit.

By offering a compromise, you demonstrate your willingness to work with Bob while still trying to secure a price that's favorable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000. How about we try to find a compromise at $1,325,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum. You have a few reasons to reject and try for a better deal:

* **You're close:** The difference between your minimum and Bob's offer is only $25,000. It's worth trying to close that gap.
* **John is still an option:**  You can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails.
* **Negotiating shows value:** By continuing to negotiate, you show Bob the value of your product and that you're not willing to settle for just any price.

**Next step:**  You will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the remaining gap and hopefully secure a price closer to your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,325,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway *one more time*. Let's settle on $1,312,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1312500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **One more compromise:** This final offer emphasizes that you are willing to negotiate, but also that you're reaching your limit.
* **Almost at minimum:**  $1,312,500 is just slightly above your minimum of $1,200,000, but still provides a good profit.
* **Finality:**  The message suggests this is your final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.

This counteroffer is a strategic move to encourage Bob to accept while still ensuring you get a price that's fair to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,305,000. If you're willing to accept that, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,305,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,305,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, there's not much room for further negotiation.  It's not worth risking further rounds with the possibility of a failed deal and having to settle for John's offer.

* **Small difference:**  There's only $5,000 difference between your minimum and Bob's offer, making it unlikely that you can achieve a significantly better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of continuing the negotiation outweighs the potential reward. You might end up losing time and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob.
* **John is a safe bet:** Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price, ensuring you don't lose money and providing a secure outcome. 

By selling to John, you secure a solid profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
