"Alice,  $1,150,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to meet you halfway. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more to you. Let's work together to find a solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,075,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll come down to $1,087,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
