"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,150,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down as much as possible.  He's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what he's willing to pay. This will hopefully encourage Alice to counteroffer with a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to meet you halfway. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more to you. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a slight improvement, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is still within his budget and closer to his target price. This counteroffer aims to encourage Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,075,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll come down to $1,087,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,087,500, which is only $37,500 above Bob's ideal price.  This is a good deal considering Bob's budget and the fact that he can always buy from John for $1,200,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
