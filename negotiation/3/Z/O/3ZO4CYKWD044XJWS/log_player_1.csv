While $900,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try and push for a higher price. I still have a few rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're making progress! I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but that's still a bit out of my range. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $925,000.

``` 

$925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting close.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up just a bit more. I have a few more rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to sell to John yet."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $930,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're down to the last two rounds. While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  I'm going to sell to John and secure the best possible outcome for myself."
