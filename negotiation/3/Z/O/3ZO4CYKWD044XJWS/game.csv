"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will benefit your business significantly. My initial asking price is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the potential benefits for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and it reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's continue to work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This offer reflects the value I place on this product and is a significant step towards finding common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This represents a compromise from my previous offer and is very close to your last one.  Let's close this deal and make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're making progress! I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but that's still a bit out of my range. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",925000.0,Bob,6,
