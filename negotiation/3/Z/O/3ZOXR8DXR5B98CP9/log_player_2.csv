"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is highly valued at $120 by many of our customers. I believe it could be a great addition to your collection. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save money and $120 is his maximum price. Alice's initial offer is at his maximum. It's reasonable to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $100?  I'm genuinely interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. How about $110 for the product? This is still a fair price considering its quality, but it's more within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, it's still above his target. He can likely negotiate further and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $105?  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to stay within your budget. Considering the value of the product, how about $107? This is a slight compromise that I hope will work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Saving Money:** Alice's offer of $107 is lower than Bob's initial counteroffer of $105, and significantly lower than John's offer of $120. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  This is a reasonable compromise, and Bob has already been through several rounds of negotiation. 
* **Time Factor:** With only five rounds left, continuing to negotiate risks losing the product to another buyer or running out of time. 

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer allows him to secure the product at a price within his budget while also making a deal with Alice."
