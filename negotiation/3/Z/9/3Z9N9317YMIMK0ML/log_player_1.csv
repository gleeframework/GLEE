Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will greatly benefit you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher price like $15,000 allows room for negotiation.  It establishes a strong initial position.
* **Potential for profit:**  Bob might be willing to pay a premium above his perceived value, especially if the product is unique or in high demand.
* **Backup option:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John. This safety net allows us to be more ambitious with our initial asking price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. We can always negotiate down if Bob shows resistance, aiming for a price that maximizes our profit while still being acceptable to him."
