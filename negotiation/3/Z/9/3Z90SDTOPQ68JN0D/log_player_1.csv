Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** While I'd prefer to get more, Bob is very close to my fallback offer from John. Accepting $1,062,500 is a reasonable compromise and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
