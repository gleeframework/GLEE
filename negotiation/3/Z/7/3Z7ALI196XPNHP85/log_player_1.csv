Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. I'm hoping to capitalize on the fact that he might be willing to pay a little more to get the product, but I'm also aware that he has the option to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's less than what I consider fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering a price of $85, which is still higher than Bob's last offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also trying to maintain some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $82 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and is a good compromise. Accepting his offer ensures I get a better price than selling to John and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
