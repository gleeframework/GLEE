"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",10200.0,Bob,4,
