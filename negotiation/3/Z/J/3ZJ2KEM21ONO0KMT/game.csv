"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,250,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be worth it for you. I'm confident in its value and know it can be a valuable asset for your business.  However, I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $1,200,000, so I'm only able to accept this offer for a limited time.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
