Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $120, there's no need to go lower.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (even though it's above his perceived value). He might be willing to pay a bit more than $80 if he values the product enough. 
* **Maintain Value Perception:**  Offering a price significantly lower than $120 might make Bob question the product's value."
