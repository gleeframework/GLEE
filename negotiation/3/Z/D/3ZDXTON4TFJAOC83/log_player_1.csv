"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While $800,000 is a significant amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
