"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000 for the product. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $14,500. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $14,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high. How about we settle at $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'll counter with $14,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet at this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
