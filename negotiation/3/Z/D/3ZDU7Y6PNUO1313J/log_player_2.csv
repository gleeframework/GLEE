Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $14,500. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $14,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high. How about we settle at $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'll counter with $14,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is signaling this is her final concession.  While we might get the price a bit lower, it's getting close to John's price, and there's no guarantee Alice will go any lower. It's better to secure the deal at $14,000 now."
