Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.
