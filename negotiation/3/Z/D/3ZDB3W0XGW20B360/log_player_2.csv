"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $175 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is still a good deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $135 is closer to his budget, he still has the option to buy from John for $100. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's a chance he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $115 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop to $125.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $125 is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his goal. He can still get the product from John for $100, so he should continue to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to pay $120, which is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 120}
