"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than your valuation, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Could we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",850000.0,Alice,5,
