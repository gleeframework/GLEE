Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see great value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but there's still a chance he accepts the initial price.
* **Consider the Alternative:** While John offers a guaranteed $800,000,  selling to Bob has the potential for a significantly higher profit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
 
This strategy aims for a high potential gain while acknowledging the fallback option of selling to John."
