"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know if that's something you would be willing to work with.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $12,000 is better, my budget really only allows for $7,500.  If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,500? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
