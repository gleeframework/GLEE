You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You're still willing to pay more than John, but you have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my preferred range. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. There's still room to bargain before I have to resort to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. This offer is still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this move will entice Alice to accept and finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and very close to my previous counteroffer.  While I'd love to get it even lower, the risk of further negotiation potentially pushing her price back up or her walking away entirely is too great.  At this point, accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoid the risk of losing the deal completely."
