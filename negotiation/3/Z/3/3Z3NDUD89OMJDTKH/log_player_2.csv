"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. A counteroffer of $600,000 is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  It's likely Alice will counter, but this sets the stage for a negotiation."

{""product_price"": 650000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving towards a possible agreement."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better price.  With only three rounds left, the pressure is mounting on Alice to reach an agreement.  By continuing to reject and counteroffer, Bob is hoping to push Alice to a price closer to $675,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, it's time for Bob to take a more aggressive approach.  This counteroffer is only $25,000 lower than Alice's latest offer, showing a clear willingness to compromise.  It also puts pressure on Alice to consider accepting the deal. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have one last chance to make a counteroffer before he's forced to decide between Alice's final offer and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations with Alice. Bob has rejected Alice's offer twice in a row, and now he has one final chance to make a counteroffer before he has to buy from John. While Alice's offer of $750,000 is not terrible, Bob can likely still get a better price.  He should continue to push for a lower price, knowing that he has a fallback option with John if he can't get a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final chance to secure a deal with Alice.  He needs to make a counteroffer that is both appealing to Alice and still within his budget.  Offering $725,000 is a compromise. It's a fair price for both parties and shows that Bob is serious about closing the deal. This is a high-stakes move, but it's Bob's best shot at securing a lower price than John's $1,000,000 offer."
