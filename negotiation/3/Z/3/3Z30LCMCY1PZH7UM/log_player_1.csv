{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product holds a value of $1,000,000 for Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to maximize profit, aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for potential negotiation should Bob counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't settle for less than $800,000.

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of realism, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale at a price close to Bob's maximum valuation."
