Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profits, but I also want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. We'll see if he accepts or counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's far below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll see if I can get closer to my target value with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. This is still a good deal for Bob considering he started at $800,000, and it's closer to my desired price point. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him and we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price that's more in line with my expectations.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a compromise, lower than my previous offer but still above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping to reach a middle ground and finally close the deal.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price. While $950,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum.  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a sure thing, and I'm going to accept it.  It's time to move on and secure the sale."
