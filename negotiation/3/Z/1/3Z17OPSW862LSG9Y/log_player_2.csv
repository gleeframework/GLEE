Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's counteroffer is $11,500, which is still higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to go with John and buy the product for $10,000."
