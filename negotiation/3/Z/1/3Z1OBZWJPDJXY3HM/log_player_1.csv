**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I still have room to negotiate. Bob is clearly interested and increasing his offers, signaling a willingness to compromise. I'll push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close!  I appreciate you coming up on the price.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I have another buyer for $1,000,000 (John), there is no point in going below this price. By offering $1,000,000  I am signaling to Bob that this is my final offer and a very attractive deal considering its value."
