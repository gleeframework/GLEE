"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to you. This unique item is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I am extending the chance to own it at a special price tailored to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction.

Considering its significance and rarity, I propose to sell the product to you for $950,000. This offer reflects my commitment to finding the right owner who appreciates its true worth and ensures a fair deal for both parties.

Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. I am here to discuss any further details or negotiate terms that might make this transaction even more appealing to you.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is too high. While her message tries to frame the product as being worth $1,000,000 to you, you know you have the option to buy it from John for that price.  You should try to negotiate a better price with Alice or be prepared to buy from John."
