"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000.

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $12500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $11000 is a more reasonable price. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I think $12000 is the minimum I can accept. It's the lowest price I'm willing to sell the product for, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,5,
