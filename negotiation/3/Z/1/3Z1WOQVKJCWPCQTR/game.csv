"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's unique value. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's try to make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a significant offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $1150000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the original price I had in mind.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $1050000. This would allow us both to secure a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's try to close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
