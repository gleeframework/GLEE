"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm giving him a bit of room to negotiate. I'll keep the $15,000 sale with John in mind if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get more than $15,000.  While I'm aware I can sell to John for that price, I'm going to try and see if I can get a better deal with Bob.  I still have 8 rounds left, so I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that by meeting him halfway, he'll be more willing to negotiate. I'll also keep in mind that I have 7 rounds left and the option to sell to John if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get even more, Bob's offer is a good compromise and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, I might run out of rounds and be forced to sell to John for a lower price.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting a worse one later."
