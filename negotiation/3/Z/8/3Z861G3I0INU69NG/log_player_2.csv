"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's currently worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to secure this valuable product at a price that's significantly lower than its true market value.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
