"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'll offer it to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit.  Would you consider $7,500?  That's the best I can do.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad to see you're willing to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'll offer it to you for $8,750. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,7,
