"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $10500. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell the product for $9800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10150.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move the product without taking a significant loss.  What do you think?",10150.0,Alice,5,
