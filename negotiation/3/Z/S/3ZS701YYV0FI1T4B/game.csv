"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable product. I believe its potential is immense, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for the right individual. My asking price is $2000000. I'm open to discussing this further, and I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1400000 is a considerable sum, it falls short of the value I see in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1800000. This reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I still think $1800000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
