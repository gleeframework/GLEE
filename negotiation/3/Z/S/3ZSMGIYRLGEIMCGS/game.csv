"Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,120.0
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,,

"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice.  While $110 is closer, it's still a little more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to do it for $95?",95.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,130.0
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we try $127.50? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us.",127.5,Alice,5,,
