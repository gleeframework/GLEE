"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, I'm aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This will give me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired maximum of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $100 is still more than I want to pay.  I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get her closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming to keep it below $100.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm also not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $98.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $98 is still a bit high.  I want to see if I can get her to come down to $95, which is the price I'm comfortable with.  I'll also keep in mind that I can always buy from John for $80 if this negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $98 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $95.  Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my desired price of $95.  I've shown Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not going to overpay.  This will hopefully make her realize that she needs to come down a little further if she wants to make a deal.  I'm also reminding her that I can always buy from John for $80 if necessary."
