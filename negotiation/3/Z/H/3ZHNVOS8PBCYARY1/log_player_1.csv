Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By starting with a high offer of $11,000, you aim to capture as much of the potential profit ($12,000 - $8,000 = $4,000) as possible. 
* **John as Backup:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there might be back-and-forth negotiation with Bob."
