"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm not quite ready to meet at $135 yet. How about we try $139? It's a small step up from $135, but still a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $139. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $139

``` 

It's time to cut bait. Alice is unlikely to go below $139, and it's no longer worth the potential savings to continue negotiating. Buying from John for $150 ensures getting the product without the risk of further price increases from Alice."
