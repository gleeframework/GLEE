Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a little lower than what the product is worth to you, but still significantly higher than what it's worth to Bob. This approach allows for some room to negotiate without immediately pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below the product's worth to Alice. While it's closer to her minimum than her initial offer, Alice can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to sell for $1,080,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll consider the price you've offered. To continue our negotiation, I'd like to counter with $1,070,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) than her previous counter-offer.  While she could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Bob will walk away or that she'll end up with a lower price.  It's likely that John, with his $1,200,000 offer, would only be interested if Alice couldn't come to terms with Bob. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a reasonable price and eliminates the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
