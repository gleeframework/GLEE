"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer is the best strategy.**  This allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price.
* **Buying from John is not yet the best option.** You're trying to save as much money as possible, and you might be able to get a better price from Alice through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for this product, as that's its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, and Alice is asking for $1,000,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer gives you more room to negotiate.**  While Alice might be unwilling to go much lower, you still have some leverage.
* **Buying from John is still not the best option.** There's a chance you could still get a better price from Alice, and you haven't reached your limit on negotiation rounds yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident that this is the most we can do. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You are determined to pay no more than $800,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer keeps you in the negotiation.**  While you have reached the midpoint of your negotiation rounds, there's still a chance you can get Alice to come down further. 
* **Buying from John is still not the best option.**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and there's a chance Alice will make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still too much for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $800,000.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still committed to your initial offer, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is a significant concession from my original offer. I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your target, you are determined to pay no more than $800,000.
* **You've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.** You've already rejected Alice's offers multiple times, and she's shown a reluctance to drop below $900,000.
* **Buying from John is now the best option.** You can secure the product at your maximum price point, saving you $100,000 compared to Alice's current offer.  While you might be able to get a slightly better price from Alice by continuing to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement and being left with no product is too high at this point."
