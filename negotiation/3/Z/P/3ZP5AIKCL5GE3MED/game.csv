"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for this product, as that's its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident that this is the most we can do. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still too much for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $800,000.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're still committed to your initial offer, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is a significant concession from my original offer. I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,7,
