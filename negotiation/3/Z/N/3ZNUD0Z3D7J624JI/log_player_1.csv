Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the exclusivity of the offer, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I can derive from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value I can derive from it, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price significantly closer to $1,000,000. Accepting John's offer guarantees the desired profit."
