Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500000 is unfortunately far below what I can accept for this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe its true value is significantly higher.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to reduce my price to $1250000. This is a substantial compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great deal for the benefits this product offers.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to come up slightly. However, $625000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $875000?  This is a significant reduction from my last offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.  If you're truly interested in this product, I encourage you to seriously consider this final offer.
