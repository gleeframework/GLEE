"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested, but I'd need to bring the price down to $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob! I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we aim for $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $120 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. How about we compromise at $130?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price. $130 is still outside my budget. How about we try $125? It's a small difference, but I think it's fair considering we've both moved a little. ",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. $125 is getting closer to what I'm looking for. How about we meet at $135?",135.0,Alice,7,
