(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down slightly, but it's still above your target price. There's still room for further negotiation, and it's worth trying to see if you can get closer to your target price. Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. You've increased your offer from the previous round, showing your willingness to meet Alice halfway.  However, it's still below Alice's current offer, leaving room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to find a price that works for both of you without rushing into a deal that's not ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While $1,125,000 is still above your target price, it's only $125,000 over. Continuing to negotiate might save you another $25,000, but the risk of losing the deal altogether becomes higher. Accepting this offer is a reasonable compromise, securing the product at a price that's still within your budget."
