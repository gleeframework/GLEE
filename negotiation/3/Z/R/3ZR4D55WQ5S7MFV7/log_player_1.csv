Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $12,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,750?  That would be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try $12,600. It's just a small step up from your last offer, but I think it's a good compromise that will allow us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 12600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I would like to counter with a price of $12,550 for your product. This is my final offer within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only $50 less than my previous counteroffer and it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  It's better than risking a continued stalemate or selling to John for $12,000."
