"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $140?  Let's see if we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $160. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob! I understand that you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $155. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",155.0,Alice,5,
