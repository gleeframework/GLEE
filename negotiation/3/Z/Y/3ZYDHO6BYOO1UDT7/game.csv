"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I can't go as low as $600,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the true value of this product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher number. Would you consider $850,000? That's a compromise I'm comfortable with.",850000.0,Alice,5,
