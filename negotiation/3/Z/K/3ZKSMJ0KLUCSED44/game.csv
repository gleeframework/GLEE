"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to go down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $97 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This is my final offer, as I'm also speaking with another buyer who's willing to pay my full asking price. Let me know if you're interested in this final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
