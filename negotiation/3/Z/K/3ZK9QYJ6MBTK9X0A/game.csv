"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $6,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle this at $8,000 even? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
