"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $9,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round, but if it doesn't work out, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize the deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer: $8,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his price. I've tried negotiating for a better price, but I'm now starting to run out of time and rounds.  To avoid risking getting nothing at all, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. This will ensure I get the best possible outcome for myself."
