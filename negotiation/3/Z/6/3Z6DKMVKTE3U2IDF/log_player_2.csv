"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $15,000 to you and Alice is offering it at $15,000, you can get it from John for the same price. There's no incentive to accept Alice's offer as you won't save any money."
