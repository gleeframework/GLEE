I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has great potential, but $800,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle around $650,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
