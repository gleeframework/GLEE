"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $230 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $230. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $230
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  Alice's offer is way too high. It's far beyond your budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and hopefully get a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $230 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $230 is my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $180. I believe this product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:** While $180 is better than $230, it's still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice.  You might be able to get closer to your goal of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer of $180, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm sticking with my offer of $80 for the product.  Let's try to find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $130? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  Alice is getting closer, but $130 is still too high. You're willing to pay $80, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John. There's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting this offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice will come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still stuck at $80. I'm not sure if we can make this work at $130.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not sure how much more room I have to go."", ""product_price"": 80}
