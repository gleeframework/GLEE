Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a price you need to meet, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to meet your price, but $950,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
