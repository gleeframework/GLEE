Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I believe this price will be enticing enough to encourage Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially reveal his own valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is still above my minimum value of $800,000, but it shows flexibility and signals my willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $600,000 is still too low for me. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to compromise further.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a reasonable profit and avoids risking further negotiation with Bob."
