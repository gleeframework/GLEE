Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great interest to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident its value will far exceed your initial outlay.  Let's discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I believe I can get closer to my target price through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest.  However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time.  Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This price still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it offers a fair return on your investment.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1200000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not quite there. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to push Bob a little further. There's a chance he might accept my next offer, and if not, selling to John is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still significantly lower than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a final price of $1,050,000. This is a serious compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts, as this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value you've been touting. I'm not willing to go any higher than this. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting close, but Bob is still a bit below my minimum value.  While I could counteroffer again, I don't want to risk a stalemate.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a safe and reliable outcome."
