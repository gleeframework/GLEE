"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest.  However, $800000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time.  Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This price still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it offers a fair return on your investment.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1200000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still significantly lower than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a final price of $1050000. This is a serious compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts, as this is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value you've been touting. I'm not willing to go any higher than this. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",950000.0,Bob,6,,
