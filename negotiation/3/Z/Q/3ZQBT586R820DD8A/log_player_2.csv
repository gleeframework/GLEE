Alice is getting closer to my price, but I'm still willing to see if she'll go lower. I'll counteroffer again and get closer to my walk-away price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider $7,800 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while accommodating your financial situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could try to push Alice a little further, $7,800 is a good price and significantly below her initial offer. It's not worth the risk of her increasing her price or me running out of rounds and having to pay John $8,000."
