"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's no need to rush into a decision, especially since you have 10 rounds and a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to test Alice's willingness to negotiate. $100 is a good starting point, leaving room for a compromise. It also shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I can still do better. I'm aiming for a price closer to my target of $100. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $115 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise. Offering $110 is a small step closer to her offer, demonstrating my flexibility while still being within my budget. This counteroffer shows good faith and encourages Alice to make a final concession."
