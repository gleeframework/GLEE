"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. While I understand its significance to you, my budget is limited. I am willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This still reflects the value I see in the product, but I'm confident it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still beyond my current budget. I am willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is closer to what you're looking for.",850000.0,Bob,4,
