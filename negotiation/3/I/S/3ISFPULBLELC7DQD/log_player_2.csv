"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm able to pay.  I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product.  This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $18,000 represents the high-end of its value, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair balance considering the product's worth and the benefits it will bring you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,000 is lower than the initial $18,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
