"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm able to pay.  I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product.  This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $18,000 represents the high-end of its value, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair balance considering the product's worth and the benefits it will bring you.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
