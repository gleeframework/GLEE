"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to settle at $9,750? That would help me make a quicker decision.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is getting closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10,200. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",10200.0,Alice,5,
