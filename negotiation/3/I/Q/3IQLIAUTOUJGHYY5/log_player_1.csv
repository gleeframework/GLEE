Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's what John will pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, presenting it as a ""special price"" might make it more appealing.

It's important to note that Bob is unlikely to accept this offer given his perceived value of the product. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still giving the appearance of a possible deal to Bob."
