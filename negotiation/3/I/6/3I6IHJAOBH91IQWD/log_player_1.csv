Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be around $100 to you. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $110. This allows you to acquire a valuable item at a reasonable cost while ensuring I receive a fair return for my investment. Let me know if this offer suits your budget."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $110 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  This would still allow you to make a profit and give me a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
