Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always beneficial to explore if I can secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. Bob gets the product for $300,000 less than its worth to him, and I make a $100,000 profit above my guaranteed sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob if he counters. 

**Important Note:** This assumes I have time to negotiate with Bob before selling to John. If the sale to John is time-sensitive, I might offer the product to Bob closer to $1,200,000 to avoid the risk of losing the guaranteed sale."
