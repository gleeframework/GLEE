"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired minimum of $150.
* **Friendly tone:**  The message is friendly and casual to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation.
* **High value proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to me, which can make Bob more inclined to agree to a higher price. 
* **Open ended question:** Asking Bob what he thinks encourages him to respond and potentially counteroffer, keeping the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is still significantly lower than my desired minimum of $150. While I could accept it and avoid further negotiation, I'm not in a rush and would like to explore if I can get closer to my target price.  It's risky, but I believe I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price closer to my desired value.
* **Positive and persuasive message:** I'm using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable and emphasize the ""fairness"" of my offer.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" for both of us to make the offer more appealing.

This counteroffer provides a good balance between moving closer to Bob's price while still pushing for a more favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired $150.  I'm not desperate to sell, and John is a guaranteed sale at a much higher price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if Bob will budge.  If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $110. It's a small compromise, but it's my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to increase the pressure on Bob.
* **Small Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a small compromise to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Direct Question:**  I'm asking a direct question to encourage Bob to respond quickly. 

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It's my last chance to close the deal with Bob. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John to guarantee my desired minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $107 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $107 is still below my desired minimum of $150.  I've reached my limit of counteroffers, and I'm not willing to go lower.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal with John, so I'll sell the product to him for $150."
