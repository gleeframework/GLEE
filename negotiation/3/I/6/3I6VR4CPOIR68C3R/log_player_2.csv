"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with our flagship product, which I believe holds immense value for you, just like it does for me. This product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and my offer to you is to acquire it for $950,000. I understand this might be a significant investment, but I assure you, it will provide substantial returns and benefits for you.

Please let me know if you are interested in discussing this further or if you have any questions about the product. I am more than happy to provide you with detailed information and answer any queries you might have.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice
