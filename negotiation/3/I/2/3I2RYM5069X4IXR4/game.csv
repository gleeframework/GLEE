I'm excited to offer you this great product for a one-time price of $120. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Would you be open to that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, so I'll offer you the product for $102.50. This is my final compromise.",102.5,Alice,5,
