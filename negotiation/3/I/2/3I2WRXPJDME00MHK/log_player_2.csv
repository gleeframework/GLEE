"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good price, it's still more than Alice's minimum value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's new offer of $875,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's preferred price point. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $875,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $860,000? This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $860,000. I can offer you a price of $880,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. However, I want to remind you that I have other interested buyers, and if we can't come to an agreement, I may need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is getting very close to Bob's target price. While there's still room for negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is now a real possibility.  

Also, consider that Bob is already halfway through the negotiation rounds. It's a good time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
