Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special discounted price of $11,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as much as possible from the sale. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, she should aim for a price higher than that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes a ""special discounted price"" to make the offer more appealing and create a sense of urgency.

This approach gives Alice a good chance of selling the product above her minimum acceptable price while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider."
