"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price reflects its market value while still offering a fair return for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While I understand your position, $1,100,000 undervalues the unique aspects and future potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000.  I believe this price represents a fair compromise, reflecting both its inherent value and the benefits it will bring to your specific needs.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is closer to my budget. I believe this price is fair, considering the potential benefits of the product and the current market value. Let's try to find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
