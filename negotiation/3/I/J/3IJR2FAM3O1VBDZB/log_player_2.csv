Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $10,000, and he should try to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really think you'll get a lot of value out of this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,000 is closer to his price range, he can still get a better deal.  He should continue negotiating with Alice, as there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I can do one better. How about we meet in the middle of $10,500 and my original offer of $10,000, which is $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, it's unlikely Alice will budge further.  At $10,250, Bob gets the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer, and Alice still makes a decent profit. Accepting the offer is the most practical choice at this point."
