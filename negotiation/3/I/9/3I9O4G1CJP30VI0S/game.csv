"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product and would be happy to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $82.50. Let me know what you think.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a fair price, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $81.50. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it for both of us.",81.5,Alice,5,
