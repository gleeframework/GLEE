"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. ",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true market value. To move this forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This reflects the immense value and potential this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  However, the gap between our positions remains quite large.  I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to see a more significant move on your end to justify it. I'm now proposing a price of $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're still pretty far apart on price.  To be honest, if we can't find a number closer to my budget, I might have to explore other options. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as my final offer. ",800000.0,Bob,6,
