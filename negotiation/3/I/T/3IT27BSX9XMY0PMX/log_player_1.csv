Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Knowing its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **High but Justifiable:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, implying the price is justified. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. While there's a chance Bob could reject the offer, the potential for a $125,000 profit over John's offer makes it a worthwhile gamble."
