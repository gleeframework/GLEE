"Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer. How about we try $145? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Would $140 be acceptable to you?",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $145, and now you're asking for $140? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $142.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can make a deal work.",142.5,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would $141 be acceptable to you?",141.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $142, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. Let's try to meet in the middle one last time. How about we say $141.50? It's a small concession, but I'm willing to make it for the sake of the deal.",141.5,Alice,9,
