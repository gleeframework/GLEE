"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm sure this product is valuable, but I'd be happy to pay $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? It's still a great price for the value this product offers.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a little high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,250?  I'm really interested in this product and hope we can come to an agreement.",12250.0,Bob,4,
