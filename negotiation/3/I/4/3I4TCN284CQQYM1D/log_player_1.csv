Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you would be very interested in. It's unique and has a lot of potential. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's unique qualities and potential to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the deal makes it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message leaves the door open for negotiation, implying that I might be willing to compromise. 

**This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while still having a backup buyer in John if Bob rejects the offer.**"
