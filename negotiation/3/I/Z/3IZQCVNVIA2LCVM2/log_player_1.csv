"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible.  This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to come up to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $11,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my $15,000 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $13,000.  This is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum valuation, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant.  I believe there's room for improvement and I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'm hoping that a few more rounds will bring Bob closer to my desired price.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is a reliable option if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $12,500. This is a reasonable compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will be the final offer that Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  We've reached a stalemate with Bob.  His counteroffers are getting closer, but not close enough to my minimum. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk losing more time and potentially getting a worse deal."
