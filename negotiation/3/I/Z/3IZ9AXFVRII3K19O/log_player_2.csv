It's not worth paying $180 for a product worth $150 to you.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

While $160 is closer to my limit, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit more.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Alice is not willing to budge on her price. While $155 is close to my limit, I don't want to keep haggling and risk losing the opportunity to buy from John.  I'll buy the product from John for $150."
