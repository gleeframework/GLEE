Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

This offer is a good starting point. It's a little lower than what I want, but it's still a good deal for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if necessary."
