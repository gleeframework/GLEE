"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly below the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves me room to negotiate if he counters.  I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic to build a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent offer, I'm holding out for a bit more. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above $13,000.  I believe there's room for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than I need to sell for.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,250. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my bottom line. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn.  $13,250 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it."
