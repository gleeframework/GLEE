"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and should aim to push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm still confident in the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much as possible. While $11,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, Bob can still aim for a lower price. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  I think that's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and the difference is now only $500. 
* **Time:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's important to consider the risk of continuing to negotiate. If the deal falls through, Bob will have to pay John $15,000.
* **Value:**  The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and buying it for $11,500 is a significant saving.

While Bob might prefer a lower price, accepting the offer at this point is a good balance between saving money and avoiding the risk of losing the deal."
