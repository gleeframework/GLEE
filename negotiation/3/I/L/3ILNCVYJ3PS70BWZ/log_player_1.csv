""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly profitable asset for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your initial asking price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  While selling to John is tempting, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the extensive work behind it.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair offer considering the long-term value this product will bring."",
""product_price"": 1200000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This represents a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still too far from my minimum. I'll try to steer him closer to $900,000, but selling to John is looking more appealing with each lowball offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  However, the value of this product is directly tied to its potential for generating substantial returns, which I believe it can do for you.  I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's more than fair."",
