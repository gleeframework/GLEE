"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly profitable asset for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your initial asking price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the extensive work behind it.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair offer considering the long-term value this product will bring.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This represents a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  However, the value of this product is directly tied to its potential for generating substantial returns, which I believe it can do for you.  I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's more than fair.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
