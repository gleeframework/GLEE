"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly negotiating. Let's see if we can push him a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell,  I need to be fair to the product's value. Could you consider $1,775,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make sure I'm making a smart investment. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $1,725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly reaching his limit, and while we might squeeze a bit more in further rounds, it's getting riskier.  $1,725,000 is a strong offer and a significant profit above John's $1,500,000. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob altogether."
