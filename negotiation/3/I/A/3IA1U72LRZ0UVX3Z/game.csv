"Alice, that price is way too high for me. This product would be worth $6,000 to me at most.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think the product is worth $6,000 to you, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are still very far apart on price.  $13,500 is much more than I'm willing to spend. To be honest, anything above $8,000, and I might as well buy from John.  Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is still a good profit for me, but also a good compromise. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement you've made. However, I'm on a tight budget. I can do $8,000, which is my absolute limit. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, but I really need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is still a bit above your limit, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
