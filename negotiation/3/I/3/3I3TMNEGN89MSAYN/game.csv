"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to move closer to your range. Would you consider $1,500,000? I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, but that price point significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000 as a show of good faith, but I can't go any lower. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
