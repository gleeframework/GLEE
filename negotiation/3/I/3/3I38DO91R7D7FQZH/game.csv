"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This is a fair price that allows us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
