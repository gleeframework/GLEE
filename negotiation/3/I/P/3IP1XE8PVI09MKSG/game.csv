"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,3,
