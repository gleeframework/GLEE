"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to my initial offer, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you've indicated.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
