Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter and work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $950,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $920,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely. It's also significantly more than John's offer."
