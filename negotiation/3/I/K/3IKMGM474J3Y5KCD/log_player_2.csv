Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000,  which still reflects the product's high value to you. This is my final offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,450,000, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but is unlikely to go much lower than $1,450,000. It's better to secure the product at this price than risk the negotiations breaking down and having to buy from John at full price."
