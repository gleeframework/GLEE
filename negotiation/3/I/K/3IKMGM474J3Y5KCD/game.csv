"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000,  which still reflects the product's high value to you. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,450,000, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
