"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of great value to your business.  I understand this product is worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  I'm asking for $1,100,000. This gives you a significant return on your investment, and it allows me to get a price closer to what the product is worth to me.  Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
