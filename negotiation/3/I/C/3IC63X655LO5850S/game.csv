,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $1,225,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
