,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $8500?  It's still a good price for you and a fair deal for me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $8500 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8750.  Let's split the difference and get this deal done.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $8750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8625?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close this deal.",8625.0,Bob,4,
