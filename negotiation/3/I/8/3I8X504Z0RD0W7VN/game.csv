"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1687500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1800000 is too high, and $1687500 is too low. Let's meet in the middle of those two numbers, at $1743750.
