Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, and I think we're very close to an agreement.  $825,000 is still a bit outside my budget.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $815000. I'll offer you the product for $825000, which is the highest price I'm willing to accept.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Only One Round Left:** With only one round remaining, the chances of securing a lower price from Alice are slim. 
* **Alice's Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.
* **Close to Target:**  While $825,000 is closer to your target price than previous offers, it's still above your ideal price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a significant risk that if you reject Alice's final offer, you might not be able to secure a better price in the final round, and you could end up with a worse deal or no deal at all.

**It's better to be safe than sorry. Buying from John at $1,200,000 secures the product and allows you to avoid the risk of a failed negotiation with Alice.**"
