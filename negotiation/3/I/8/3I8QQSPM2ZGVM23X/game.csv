"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still above my target price.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product,  which is still a fair price considering its value to you. I hope we can come to an agreement. ",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850000. This is a fair price, taking into account the market value and the value it holds for me. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $850000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $800000. This price would be a fair compromise for both of us. I'm confident that we can come to an agreement if we continue to work together.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're close to an agreement, but I'm not willing to accept $800000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer you the product for $825000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, and I think we're very close to an agreement.  $825000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $810000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product and our respective targets.  I'm confident we can reach a deal on this number.  What do you say?",810000.0,Bob,6,
