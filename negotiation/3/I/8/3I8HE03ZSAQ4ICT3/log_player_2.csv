"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I understand it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the $1,500,000 you'd pay to John.  Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, you're still getting a good deal at $1,200,000. It's in your best interest to accept her offer and save $300,000."
