"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than her product valuation, it's still considerably higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to purchase from John at a much lower price."
