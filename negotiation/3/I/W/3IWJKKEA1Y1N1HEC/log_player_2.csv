"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $135.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $135 is cheaper than buying from John for $150. 
* Although the product is worth $120 to Alice, the offer of $135 still allows you to get the product for a lower price than you would pay elsewhere."
