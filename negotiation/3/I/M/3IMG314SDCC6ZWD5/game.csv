"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a new offer of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9800. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.
