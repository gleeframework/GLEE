Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a price point that is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), giving me room for negotiation if needed.
    * Still attractive enough that Bob might consider it a ""good deal"" compared to not getting the product at all. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on selling to John at my desired minimum price."
