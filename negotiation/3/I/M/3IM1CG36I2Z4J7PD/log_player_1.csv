``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a good product, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway while still getting a decent price for the product."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but  $132.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $133.75?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 133.75}
``` 

I'm proposing a price that is slightly above Bob's last offer, but still lower than my desired price. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise that will get the deal done."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $132?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to accept his offer and secure the sale."
