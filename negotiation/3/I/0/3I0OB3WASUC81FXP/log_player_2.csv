"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. We are offering it to you for $950,000, taking into account its high value and the opportunity it presents for your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob should aim to get the price closer to his target of $800,000.  He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  While John's offer is a safety net, Bob should try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us. Let's see if we can work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering the value it holds for your business, we are willing to negotiate further. Our counteroffer is $900,000 for the product. We believe this strikes a balance between our valuation and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's target price of $800,000.  However, it's closer to his acceptable range.  Bob should continue negotiating and try to get the price lower.  While buying from John is an option, Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price with Alice and should keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming to get the price down to $875,000. This would allow for a win-win scenario, ensuring a good return for you while still remaining within my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. We understand your position and are committed to finding a solution that works for both parties. Our latest counteroffer is $890,000 for the product. We hope this proposal helps us move closer to closing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to Bob's target price of $800,000. While further negotiation could potentially get the price even lower, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer or Bob running out of rounds and having to buy from John for $1,000,000 is high.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids potential loss."
