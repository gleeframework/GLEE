"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,500 is below her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of getting a better deal from Alice or proceeding with your backup option."
