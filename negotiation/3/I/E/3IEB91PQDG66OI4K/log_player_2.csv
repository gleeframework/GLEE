"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay $120 at most, and Alice is offering $110. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you have another seller to go to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant reduction:**  A $15 reduction from Alice's offer signals a serious attempt at negotiation.
* **Consider the middle ground:** This price is roughly halfway between your target ($120) and Alice's minimum ($80). 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** There's still some wiggle room to adjust the price if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While lower than her initial offer, $105 is still above your target price of $120. 
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  
* **Buying from John is a safe option:**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always fall back to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental decrease:** This counteroffer shows you are willing to compromise while still aiming for a better price.  
* **Approaching your limit:** This offer is closer to your target price of $120. 
* **Test the waters:** See if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the same as her first offer:**  This suggests she might not be willing to negotiate much further. 
* **You're getting closer to your limit:**  Each rejection brings you closer to having to buy from John.
* **There's still room for a counteroffer:** Since Alice is willing to negotiate, there's still a chance you can get a better price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:** This offer is halfway between your previous offer of $100 and her current offer of $110.
* **Testing compromise:**  See if Alice is willing to meet you at this midpoint.
* **Balancing price and risk:**  You're getting closer to your limit, but a small compromise might be worthwhile to avoid buying from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is increasing:** This suggests she's becoming less flexible and might be unwilling to budge further.
* **You're getting closer to your limit:**  You're nearing the point where it's more advantageous to buy from John.
* **A counteroffer might still be worthwhile:** There's still a chance to reach a deal that is more favorable than buying from John.  However, it's becoming increasingly risky."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This is a risky offer, as it's very close to your limit.  It's likely the best you can do with Alice.
* **Testing Alice's limits:** See if she's willing to accept this price.
* **Minimizing potential loss:** While buying from John is still an option, this counteroffer gives you the best chance of getting a slightly better price than John's."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too close to your limit:**  You're only saving $2 by buying from Alice. 
* **Risk outweighs potential reward:**  There's a high chance Alice will reject any further counteroffers, leaving you with no product.
* **John offers certainty:** Buying from John guarantees you get the product and avoids any further negotiation risks.  It's a safer choice, even if it's slightly more expensive."
