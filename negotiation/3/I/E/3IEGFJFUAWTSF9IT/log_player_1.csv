Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have strong interest from another party."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting high ($950,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning another buyer (""John"") creates urgency, making Bob less likely to stall.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance: enticing Bob with the potential upside of the product while making it clear this is a premium opportunity."
