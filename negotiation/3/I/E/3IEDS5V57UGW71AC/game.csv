"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
