Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I think it would be a great fit for you, and this is a very competitive price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible.
* **Bob's Perspective:** While the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the offer as a good deal.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that.

By starting high but just below your guaranteed price, you leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit."
