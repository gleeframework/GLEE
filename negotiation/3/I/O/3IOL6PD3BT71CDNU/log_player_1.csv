Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to justify the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he's truly interested.  You can then potentially meet in the middle, still exceeding your minimum price.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might outright reject the offer. However, the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
