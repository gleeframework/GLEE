"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Can you consider that price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $800000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you can accept it.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept it. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer: $795000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",795000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm not willing to go up to $795000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $795000, which is $722500. I'm willing to pay $722500 for the product. This is my final offer.",722500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go up to $780000. I've already made it clear that I'm willing to pay $722500, and that's my final offer. I'm not willing to negotiate further. I'm going to have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000.",722500.0,Bob,10,
