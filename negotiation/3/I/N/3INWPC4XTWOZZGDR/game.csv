"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product worth $1,200,000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise that still gives you a good deal on the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land closer to $800,000. How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
