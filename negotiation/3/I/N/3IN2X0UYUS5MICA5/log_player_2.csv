"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $18,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
 
$18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's limit of $12,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
$14,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's within his budget and significantly better than Alice's initial offer. Accepting the offer allows Bob to save money compared to buying from John."
