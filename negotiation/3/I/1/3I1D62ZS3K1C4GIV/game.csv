"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $8,000.  Would you consider $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. However, I still feel that $17,000 is beyond my budget. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is feasible.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $15,000 for this.  This is my final offer - I have another buyer ready at this price, but I wanted to give you the opportunity first.",15000.0,Alice,5,
