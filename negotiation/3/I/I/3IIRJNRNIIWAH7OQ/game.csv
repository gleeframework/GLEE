"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $10000. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet at $11500? It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11500 is a bit steep. Can you meet me at $10800? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to purchasing the product. However, I still need to make a profit.

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10200 for the product. Can you consider meeting me at that price?",10200.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.
