Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value exceeding the asking price, potentially swaying Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer helps gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he outright rejects $12,000, you can quickly adjust your strategy knowing you have John as a backup."
