"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, I think $102 is still a bit too low for me. I can offer you a final counteroffer at $108. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",108.0,Alice,7,

"I'm really close to giving up, but I still think this product could be a great fit. I'm willing to meet you at $106, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",106.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $106. I think we've danced around the price enough, and I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $110, and that's my last word on the price. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm moving on.",110.0,Alice,9,
