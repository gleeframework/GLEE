Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1050000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still profit while I can acquire the product within my budget.  What do you think?
