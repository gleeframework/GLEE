"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't let it go for less than $1,350,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
