Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. This product is useful, but not  worth that much to me. How about we start closer to my budget?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still quite a gap. I'm willing to increase my offer to  $700,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is tempting, it's still far from my minimum target. I'll counteroffer Bob again, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, I need the price to be closer to my budget.  I can go up to $750,000. This is a strong offer and I think it's fair for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below my minimum target price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price given the product's value to you, and it's my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
