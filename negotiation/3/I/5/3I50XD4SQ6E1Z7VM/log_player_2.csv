Round 5

Round 7

# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $975000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are running out of time. While Alice's offer is getting closer, we are still in a stalemate with her. We are getting close to our maximum price point from John.  I am confident in my ability to negotiate with John, but I need to make a decision now. Buying from John is the most efficient way to guarantee I get the product while staying within my budget."
