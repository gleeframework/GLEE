# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business or personal life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. Please let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1250000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

While $1,250,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred price point. It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is closer to your last offer. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is still above your preferred price point, and you've already made several counteroffers. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be fruitless.  You can save $200,000 by buying from John instead."
