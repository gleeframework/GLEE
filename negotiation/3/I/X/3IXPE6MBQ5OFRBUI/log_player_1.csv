Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than John's offer:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate with you rather than going to John.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes the deal attractive to Bob.
* **It's a strong opening:**  By starting high, you set a high bar and demonstrate confidence in your product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is still above my minimum, it's much closer to John's offer. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm not able to go as low as $1,200,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant increase over John's offer, and it's getting closer to my desired price. It's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
