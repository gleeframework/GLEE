Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price (your ""reservation value"").
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum.  This means a successful negotiation depends on you convincing Bob to pay more than he thinks it's worth, or you accepting a price below your guarantee.

**Strategy**

Since Bob's perceived value is lower than your minimum, a direct approach is risky. You need to create value for Bob or justify a higher price.

**Possible Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Beyond its inherent value, I believe it holds the potential to significantly benefit [mention Bob's business/interests] by [explain specific benefits tied to Bob's needs].  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000.  I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment with a strong ROI for you."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's unique benefits tailored to Bob's needs, aiming to increase its perceived value beyond $1,200,000.
* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting high leaves room for negotiation and anchors the price in Bob's mind.
* **""Investment"" Language:** Framing it as an investment with ROI further shifts focus from the price to potential gains.

**Important Considerations**

* **Information is Key:**  To strengthen your position, gather information about Bob's needs and how the product can address them effectively. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate.  You have a strong alternative with John, so don't be afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price you find acceptable.

**Remember:** This is just one approach. The most effective strategy will depend on the specifics of the product, your relationship with Bob, and your negotiation skills."
