{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation, but it also ensures I won't settle for a price that's too low. I'm confident I can get a better price, but if Bob rejects, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $10,000 for this product. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I will counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price. I still have John as a backup option if I can't get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $11,500? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to keep the cost below $10,000. Could we possibly come to an agreement at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $10,000 offer. It's clear that further negotiation won't get me closer to my desired price. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
