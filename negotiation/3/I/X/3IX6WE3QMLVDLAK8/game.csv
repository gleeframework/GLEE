"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, though.  How about $12500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12500 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  Would you consider $12250?  I'm very interested in your product, and this would be a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
