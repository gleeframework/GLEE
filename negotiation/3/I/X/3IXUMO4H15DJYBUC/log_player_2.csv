"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $1,250,000 for this exceptional opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her valuation of the product.  Since you have 10 rounds to negotiate, there's ample opportunity to try and drive down the price further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is appreciated, but I'm looking to pay closer to my valuation of the product. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts with a bold move, offering the product's value to Alice.  This establishes a starting point for negotiation and shows your commitment to a fair deal. It's possible Alice might reject this offer, but it's also possible she'll see the value in closing the deal at a price that's still profitable for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept your offer of $1,000,000 for the product. This aligns well with my goal of ensuring a fair transaction while closing the deal within our agreed-upon timeframe. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has surprisingly accepted your counteroffer. This is a fantastic outcome, as you've secured the product at your desired price. Buying from Alice at $1,000,000 is significantly better than purchasing from John for $1,500,000.  There's no need to risk further negotiation when you've already achieved your goal."
