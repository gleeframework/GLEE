"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by myself. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's worth more than what you'd find on the market. Given its value to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that respects both its worth and your budget. Would you be open to exploring an arrangement that might suit us both? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $100 is still above your maximum budget of $80. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down further in price or proceed with buying from John at your target price."
