"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,200 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,600? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,600 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,6,
