Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I make at least my minimum target of $12,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I'm still determined to get as close to my target price of $12,000 as possible. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close to a deal! I'm willing to come down to $12,050. This is only a small difference from your last offer, and it would allow me to meet my minimum price. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 12050}

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very close with Bob, but it's down to the wire. With only 3 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, it's safer to sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000. This ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoid potential complications with further negotiations."
