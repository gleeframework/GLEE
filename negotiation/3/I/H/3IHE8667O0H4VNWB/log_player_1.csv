Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,800 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,100. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10100}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $10,100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, $9,900 is a very good deal considering the value of the product to Bob.  There's a good chance he'll reject a further counteroffer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to reach a better price within the remaining rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a solid price and secure the sale."
