Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Its value to both of us is undeniable. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's value and its potential to exceed expectations, you provide a rationale for the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase a product he values."
