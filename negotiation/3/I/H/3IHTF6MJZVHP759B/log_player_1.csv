Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Therefore, she starts significantly higher to explore if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""unique value"" and ""benefits"" to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. Alice can then gradually lower the price, aiming for the highest possible amount above her $800,000 minimum."
