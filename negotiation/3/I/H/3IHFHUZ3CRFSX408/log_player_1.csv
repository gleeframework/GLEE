Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price, and Bob's offer is still lower than my initial offer. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $111? I'm really interested in the product, and I'd love to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While $111 is slightly lower than my ideal price, it's still a good deal considering we're already in Round 4 and I'm getting closer to my desired price point.  There's always a risk that I could continue negotiating and end up with a lower offer, or that Bob might decide to walk away."
