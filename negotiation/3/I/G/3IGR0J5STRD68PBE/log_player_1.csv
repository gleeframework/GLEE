Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be of significant value to you. I'm asking for $14,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a profit above John's offer. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob."
