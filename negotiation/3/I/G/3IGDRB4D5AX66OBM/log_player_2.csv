"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than his maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  I'd be happy to pay $95 for the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to his ideal price point. By offering $95, Bob is leaving room for further negotiation while also showing Alice he's serious about a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $110 to $105, which is a significant move. Bob's maximum budget is $120, and $105 is a good price point that saves him $15. Accepting the offer is the best strategy in this round to secure the product at a good price."
