"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 at this time. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? This would still give me some room to cover my costs and allow you to get this valuable product.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise but $14000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $11000? This seems like a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $11000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  How about we compromise at $12500? This is a fair price that considers both our positions, and allows you to get this valuable product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we settle on $10000? I think this is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
