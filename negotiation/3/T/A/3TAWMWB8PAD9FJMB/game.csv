"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $925000. I've gone as low as I can, and I hope you can meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",925000.0,Bob,6,
