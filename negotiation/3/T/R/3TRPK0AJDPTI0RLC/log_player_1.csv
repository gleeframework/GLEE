"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $950,000 is too far below my minimum, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest.  However,  $950,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the item.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a better price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is a good offer, but I need to be at least $1,075,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  It's a small step, but it would allow me to move forward with this sale.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product and staying within my budget, I am willing to offer $1,060,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $1,060,000 is within my minimum price range and it's getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. It's better to secure this sale than risk losing the deal entirely."
