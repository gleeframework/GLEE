"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest.  However,  $950,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is a good offer, but I need to be at least $1,075,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  It's a small step, but it would allow me to move forward with this sale.  Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
