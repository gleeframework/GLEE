Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get close to Bob's perceived value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my goal of $12,000. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm counter-offering at $10,500.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
