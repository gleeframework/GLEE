"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for cheaper. By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer, which has the potential to lead to a lower price and save him money.  It's always better to try and negotiate before resorting to the higher price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. Offering $9,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously while still leaving room for further bargaining.  It's a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $10,500 is a good deal for Bob. While he initially aimed for a price closer to $9,000, accepting this offer still saves him $4,500 compared to buying from John. There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will reject further offers or become less willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price without risking losing the deal altogether."
