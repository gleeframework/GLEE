"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept.  There's significant value in this product beyond what you might currently be seeing. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful that you'll see it as a fair deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
