"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'd like to reject Alice's offer because I can get the same product from John for a lower price of $150, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
