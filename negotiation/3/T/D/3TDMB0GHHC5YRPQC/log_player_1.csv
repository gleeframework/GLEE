Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a significant profit for me and still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. I'm confident he'll find this price attractive given his perceived value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, I can still do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. It's still a good price for Bob, and it's closer to my ideal price point. I'm confident that he'll be willing to pay a little more to avoid losing this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, Bob's offer of $100 is a significant improvement over selling to John.  At this point, I'm more likely to reach a stalemate with Bob, and I'm not willing to risk losing the sale entirely. $100 is a good profit for me and I'll take it."
