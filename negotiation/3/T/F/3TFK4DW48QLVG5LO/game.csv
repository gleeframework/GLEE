"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product for a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a great product, but I've done my research and I know it's worth less than that to you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,300,000?  That's a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far apart on the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go, so let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
