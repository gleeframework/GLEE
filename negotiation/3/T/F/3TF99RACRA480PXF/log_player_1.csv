"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question, inviting Bob to engage in a discussion.

This approach is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  Will he counteroffer immediately, or will he try to negotiate?
* **Set a high starting point:** This maximizes my potential earnings.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  I'm not closing the door on a deal, but I am also signaling that I am willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum of $100, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup option gives me confidence to be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I am keeping the negotiation open and increasing the chances of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm now offering $105, which is halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving in completely. $105 is still above my minimum. 
* **Positive and open communication:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to continue the discussion. 

This approach is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:**  Demonstrating I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** It encourages Bob to either accept or make another counteroffer.
* **Maintain a strong position:** I'm still pushing for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, would you be willing to lower the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **No further negotiation:**  At this point, I've already made several concessions. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Avoiding risk:**  While John is willing to pay $100, there's no guarantee he'll still be interested in the future. It's better to secure the deal with Bob now.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm maximizing my earnings within the given constraints and avoiding potential future complications."
