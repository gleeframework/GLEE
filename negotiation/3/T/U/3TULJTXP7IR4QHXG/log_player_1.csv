Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, there's no reason to offer the product to Bob for less. You might as well start at your maximum price and see if Bob bites.  

**Important Note:**  This assumes you have no time constraints and John's offer is guaranteed. In a real-world scenario, factors like time pressure and the certainty of John's purchase could influence your offer."
