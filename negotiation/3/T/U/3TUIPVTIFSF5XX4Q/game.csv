"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $7500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can do $10000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident you'll find the product valuable, and I think this price is a fair compromise. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8500.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're considering other options, Bob, but I'm still confident you'll find this product valuable. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8500 and $10000, which is $9250. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
