"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16000. This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my limit.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to make it worth my while. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. This is a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,5,
