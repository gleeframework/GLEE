"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to begin negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your desired outcome. This leaves room for potential concessions while still aiming for a high final price. 
* **Not Too High:** While we want a high price,  $1,300,000 is still significantly less than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, making it likely to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language used suggests a willingness to negotiate, signaling to Bob that there might be flexibility in the final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both our initial offer and Bob's perceived value of the product.  We have room to negotiate and try to meet closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,000,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product is much higher.  Would you consider a price of $1,175,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a significant margin above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Concession:** By making a smaller concession ($125,000) than Bob's initial counteroffer ($300,000), we signal that we're serious about reaching a mutually beneficial agreement but won't easily concede to a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,175,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit high.  How about $1,075,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's serious. However, the current offer is still a significant distance from our previous counteroffer.  Continuing the negotiation keeps the possibility of a higher price alive. We're aiming for above $1,100,000 if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be candid, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Communication:** Being more direct about our desired price range ($1,150,000) can help focus the negotiation.
* **Significant Concession:** We're making a notable concession of $50,000 from our previous offer, signaling strong interest in closing the deal if Bob shows flexibility.
* **Compromise Proposal:** Suggesting a 50/50 split on the remaining difference ($50,000) presents a sense of fairness and potential for agreement. 
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Option:**  While we're making compromises, the current offer is still substantially above our guaranteed option with John ($800,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're clearly serious about finding a fair price, and I respect that.  To keep things moving, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  I think this represents a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,100,000 is a very good price, exceeding our minimum acceptable price by a substantial margin. 
* **Limited Upside:** While we could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Bob's latest offer and message suggest he might be nearing his upper limit. 
* **Time Value:** Reaching a deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and secures a significant profit."
