{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $8,500 is a good price, there's a chance Bob can negotiate an even better deal with Alice. It's worth exploring the negotiation process further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Starting with a counteroffer of $7,500 shows Alice that Bob is serious about saving money. This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, creating room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has already shown he's willing to walk away, and Alice has shown flexibility. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a compromise. His previous offer of $7,500 was rejected, but Alice is willing to negotiate. This counteroffer of $7,750 is a small increase from his previous offer, showing flexibility while still seeking a significant discount. It's a reasonable middle ground that might entice Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,250 is a good compromise. Bob has already rejected a similar offer of $8,000, but there is a chance that Alice will not budge further.  This offer is closer to the midpoint of Bob's initial counteroffer ($7,750) and Alice's previous offer ($8,000).  Accepting this offer would secure a significant discount compared to buying from John and  reduce the risk of further negotiation breakdown."
