"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 just doesn't cover my costs. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away happy.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $97.50 is still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'll do $101.25.  That's only a dollar more than my minimum, and I think it's a fair compromise.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $100.625? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",100.625,Bob,6,
