Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 just doesn't cover my costs. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away happy.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $97.50 is still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'll do $101.25.  That's only a dollar more than my minimum, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.25.
