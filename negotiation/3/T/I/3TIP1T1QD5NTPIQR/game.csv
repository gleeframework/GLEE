"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
