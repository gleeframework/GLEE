"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to close this deal.  This is a fair price given the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more realistic about my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000. I'm going to try to push Bob a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible,  $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $9,250, which reflects the product's value and offers a good deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $9250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $9250, so I'll offer $9125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even with Bob's increased offer to $9,125, it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I've already negotiated for several rounds, and there's no guarantee that I can get a higher price. It's getting late in the game, and I have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000.  It's better to take the sure thing rather than risk ending up with a lower price or no sale at all."
