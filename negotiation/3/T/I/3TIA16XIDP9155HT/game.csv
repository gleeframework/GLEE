"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I'm on a tight budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500 to close this deal.  This is a fair price given the product's value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more realistic about my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible,  $9000 is still too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $9250, which reflects the product's value and offers a good deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $9250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $9250, so I'll offer $9125. Can you consider that?",9125.0,Bob,6,
