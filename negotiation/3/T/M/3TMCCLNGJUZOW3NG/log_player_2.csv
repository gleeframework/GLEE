"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1500000 to you. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm excited to hear Alice's offer! However, I'm a savvy buyer and I want to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.

Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, I'm not sure why she's willing to sell it to me for $1,200,000. That's a significant markup, and I'm not convinced it's the best value for me.

I'll have to reject Alice's offer and see if I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'll look into buying the product from John for $1,500,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay.

My decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
