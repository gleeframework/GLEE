"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm selling it for $155. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to make a small profit to get it into the right hands. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the same product from John for $150, so rejecting Alice's offer of $155 is the best option to save money."
