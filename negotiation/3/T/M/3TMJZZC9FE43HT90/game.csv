"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,350,000 is still a bit below my desired price point. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000. This reflects the product's value and provides a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",1425000.0,Alice,3,
