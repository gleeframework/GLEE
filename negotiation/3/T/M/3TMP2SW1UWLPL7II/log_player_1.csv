Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is higher than Bob's $80 valuation, giving him room to negotiate but still leaving you with a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $100 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you don't lose money on the deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This initial offer allows for back-and-forth without immediately resorting to your fallback option (John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $70 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try to negotiate a higher price or move on to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90?  That gives you a good price, and still allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my ideal price, but it's above my minimum of $120. It's also a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by pushing for a higher price.  Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit, and it's likely the best outcome at this point."
