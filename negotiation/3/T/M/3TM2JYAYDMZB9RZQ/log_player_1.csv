"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $5,000?  That feels like a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is the lowest I can go.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about we settle at $6,500?  That's a significant compromise for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $6,500 is better than $5,000, I still feel like I can do better. I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $6,500 is still too far below what I need.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,750?  This is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  My final offer is $7,000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, I've already rejected several of his offers, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation.  The risk of losing Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price is too high.  $7,000 is a decent price, and it's better than potentially getting nothing."
