"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a price closer to $10,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping for a price a little closer to $9,250.  Would you be willing to go to $9,100?  It's just a small increase, and it would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9,100 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,250, which is $9,125. Can you accept that price?",9125.0,Bob,6,
