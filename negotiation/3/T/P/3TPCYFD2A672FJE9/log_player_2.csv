"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still above your target price. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This counteroffer establishes a clear starting point for negotiation and allows for potential negotiation space in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than my initial counteroffer but still higher than my target price. However, with 7 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate might not be worth the risk. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product for a price within my budget."
