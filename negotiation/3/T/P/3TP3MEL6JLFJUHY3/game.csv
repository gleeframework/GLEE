"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business.

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was looking for. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant amount considering my budget.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $900,000. I'm willing to compromise and counteroffer at $920,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,
