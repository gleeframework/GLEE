"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,250 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $9,750 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the value you'll receive.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I respect your position, but that price is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to do $9,500 as my final offer.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're agreeable.",9500.0,Bob,6,
