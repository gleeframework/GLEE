"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **Your maximum value:** $1,000,000
* **John's offer:** $1,000,000

Since you can get the product for the same price from John, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can potentially get a better deal if you reject Alice's offer and see if she's willing to lower her price further."
