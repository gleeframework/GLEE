"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $80, and Bob's offer is too low. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $75 is a good offer, I need to make a little more on this. I'm willing to come down to $85. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference.  How about $82.50?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $80, but no higher. Can you meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to accept and close the deal than risk further negotiations and possibly getting a lower offer or losing the deal altogether."
