"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it allows room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500.  This meets Bob halfway from his last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  If this doesn't work, I might be forced to accept John's offer, but I want to give Bob one last chance to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,200 is getting very close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'll counter with a final price in the next round to see if we can finalize the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9350}
```

This is my final offer to Bob.  It's a small increase from his last offer, and represents a good compromise.  I'm hoping he sees the value of the product and accepts. If he rejects this, I'll have to take John's offer, but I'm hoping we can finalize the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John.  While I'm disappointed we couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, I've exhausted my options and need to secure a sale. John's offer of $8,000 is a guaranteed amount and ensures I don't lose any more time negotiating with Bob."
