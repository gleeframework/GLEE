"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming low:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (almost 28% less) creates room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  While $6,500 is my initial counteroffer, I'm willing to meet Alice somewhere in the middle if needed.
* **Polite and interested:** The tone remains positive and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price of $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price range, but she's still offering a price higher than John's.  There's a small window for negotiation where I might be able to secure the product from Alice for a price lower than John's. I'll try one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to being able to make this work.  Could we settle at $7,000? That would seal the deal for me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  My counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her current offer ($7,500) and my previous offer ($6,500). 
* **Sense of urgency:** By stating that this price ""would seal the deal,"" I'm adding a bit of pressure while still maintaining a friendly tone.
* **Staying below John's price:** My goal is to get the best possible price, and remaining below John's $8,000 offer is key."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $7,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $7,250 is her final offer. This price is still higher than John's $8,000 price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better price. Therefore, it makes the most sense to buy from John at this point."
