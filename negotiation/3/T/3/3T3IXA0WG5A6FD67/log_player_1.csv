Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $10,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price ($15,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Safety net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're guaranteed to sell it to John for your minimum price.

**Important:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could offer a lower price. However, starting high gives you the best chance to maximize your profit."
