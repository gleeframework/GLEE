"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. This is a rare chance to own a highly sought-after item that will bring significant value to your business or collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's more than you need to spend. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $200,000 and still acquire the product."
