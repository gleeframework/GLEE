Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1300000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me, and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.  I have 8 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer the product to you for $1,350,000?  This gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this round."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
