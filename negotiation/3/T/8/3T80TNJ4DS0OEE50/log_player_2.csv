You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John to stay within your budget."
