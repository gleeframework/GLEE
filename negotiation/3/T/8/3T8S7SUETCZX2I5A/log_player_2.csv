"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $17,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring the negotiation process further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum offer to see if there's any wiggle room.  This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, and I'm hoping to set the stage for a negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my budget.  I'm still willing to negotiate to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm hoping that Alice will come down further with each round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product, and I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle. I'm still within my budget, but I'm getting closer to Alice's last offer, which could encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is a step in the right direction, but I still need to be sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $12,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to get the product and me to receive a reasonable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, although it is getting closer. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm particularly interested in seeing if Alice will drop to $11,000 in the next round, as that's a price I'm willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your asking price, but $12,000 is still stretching my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500?  I'm confident this price would be fair for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount, to demonstrate that I'm nearing my limit. Offering $11,500 is a compromise that is still within my budget, but it's also closer to Alice's last offer, which could make her more receptive.  I'm hoping that this will be the tipping point for Alice to accept a deal."
