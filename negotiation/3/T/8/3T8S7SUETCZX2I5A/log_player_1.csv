"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $17,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob likely thinks it's worth, but still less than my minimum. This gives us room to negotiate. 
* **Building Value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product to me. This subtly implies its potential worth to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not setting a hard line, but inviting Bob to discuss.  

**Note:** This is just a starting point.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he has expressed interest. This indicates there's potential to negotiate a higher price.  
* **Time to Counter:** I'll counter with a more reasonable price that still leaves room for further negotiation. 

**Next Move:**  I will counter with a price closer to my minimum. It's important to keep the negotiation moving while still protecting my bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not drastically.
* **Fairness:**  I frame my offer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.  
* **Motivation:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product, hoping to encourage Bob to see it as a worthwhile investment. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response to see if there's room for further negotiations or if I should consider selling to John.  
* If Bob continues to offer a low price, I might lower my counteroffer incrementally, but I won't go below $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product, and I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, which is a positive sign.  However, I believe there's still room to push for a higher price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic.  Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Move:** 

I will counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above my minimum. My goal is to reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds. I'll also remind Bob of the value of the product and the opportunity this represents for him."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is a step in the right direction, but I still need to be sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $12,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to get the product and me to receive a reasonable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Compromise:** I'm lowering my price again, but only by $1,000.  This shows flexibility without drastically reducing my profit margin.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that my offer is a ""good compromise"" for both of us.  This highlights that I'm not just trying to maximize my own gain.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value, hoping to encourage him to see it as a worthwhile investment at this price.
* **Limited Time:** With 5 rounds remaining, I need to move towards a deal but not settle too quickly.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's reaction to this offer.  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I'm willing to lower my price further or sell to John. 
* **Adapt Strategy:**  If Bob seems stuck at his current offer, I might consider selling to John in a later round, especially if there are only a few rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your asking price, but $12,000 is still stretching my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500?  I'm confident this price would be fair for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $11,500 is just $3,500 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This is a significant concession from Bob, and a reasonable compromise considering the limited rounds remaining.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation falling apart increases.  Accepting this offer secures a sale and a decent profit.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I'm accepting the offer, I'm not completely closing the door on further negotiation.  I can still try to push for a higher price if Bob shows further willingness to compromise in the future.

**Next Move:**

* **Evaluate and Communicate:**  I'll accept the offer, but communicate my willingness to continue negotiating if Bob changes his mind.  This leaves the door open for a potential higher price in the future. 
* **Focus on Closing:** With the sale secured, I can focus on finalizing the details and ensuring a smooth transaction."
