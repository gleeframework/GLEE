"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's truly one-of-a-kind, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $2000000. I'm confident that this price represents a fair value for the product, but I'm open to discussion. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1000000 is a significant amount, it's not quite enough to justify selling this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, a price that reflects the product's value and gives us both room to benefit.  This offer represents a significant concession, so let's see if we can finalize this deal.

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your maximum budget.  Continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product.  While $1250000 is a significant sum, it doesn't quite cover the value this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000, a price that allows me to make a reasonable profit and that I believe is fair, given the product's unique benefits. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay $1500000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice has come down in price, but it's still over your budget. Since she claims she has another buyer, you can try one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your maximum budget."
