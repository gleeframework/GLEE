"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This is because I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. While Bob may reject this offer, it gives me room to negotiate and allows me to understand his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $15,000. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can improve the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's necessary to keep Bob interested in the negotiation.  I'm confident that he'll be willing to pay this price, as it's still $2,000 less than what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  $13,500 is not far enough away from my minimum acceptable price to consider selling to him. I'll keep the negotiation going to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $14,500. This is a compromise, but still allows me to earn a profit that's closer to my initial goal. I'm also considering that I'm already halfway through the rounds, and I need to start closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is not willing to go any higher than $13,200.  I've already lowered my price twice, and there are only four rounds left. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial goal, I don't want to risk losing a deal completely. John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, which is a safe and guaranteed sale."
