"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,600,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price given its potential, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's unique qualities justify a higher price point. I can come down to $1,450,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,450,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
