"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be extremely valuable to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1 million to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $1500000.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, my budget allows for a maximum investment of $800000. I believe we can find a price that suits both our interests.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is a significant investment, it's unfortunately not enough to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a higher price to justify selling.  I'm prepared to accept $1200000, and believe this is a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your current offer. I would like to propose a price of $950000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise given the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
