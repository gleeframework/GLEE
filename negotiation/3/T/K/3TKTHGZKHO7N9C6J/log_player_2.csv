"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm willing to make this deal happen for $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John at his desired price point."
