Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm willing to make this deal happen for $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000,  getting Bob to pay close to that amount maximizes our potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he's very interested.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and ""time-sensitive"" can create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

By pricing the product aggressively and creating a sense of urgency, Alice increases the likelihood of securing a deal close to her ideal price."
