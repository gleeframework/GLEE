Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
$12,000 is too low for me, and I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob. I will counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $14,250? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's lower than I initially hoped, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also a good price considering we're nearing the middle of the negotiation process."
