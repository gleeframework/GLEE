Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe could significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its high quality and unique features, we're extending an exclusive opportunity to acquire it at a special introductory price of $8500. This offer is valid for the next 24 hours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible and has a limit of $8,000. Alice's offer is above that limit. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $8,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product and would be happy to purchase it for $7,500. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, we are willing to negotiate further. Our revised offer for the product is $8000. We believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget. Please let us know if this works for you, and we'll proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,000 is now within Bob's budget of $8,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will agree to a lower price, and he risks losing the deal.  Accepting the offer is the safest and most financially beneficial option in this round."
