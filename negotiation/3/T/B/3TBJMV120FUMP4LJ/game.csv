"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high value and quality, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could reach an agreement. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $95. This price reflects the product's worth while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for me. I look forward to your response.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product.  While I'm interested,  $95 is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider your offer of $85. However, I must respectfully request that you reconsider this amount as it is still slightly above the product's perceived value to you. I propose we settle on $87 for the product. This price allows for a fair transaction between us, considering the product's worth and my need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",87.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $87 is closer, I'm still a bit over my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $86?  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.",86.0,Bob,4,
