"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
