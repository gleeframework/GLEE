Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows for potential negotiation and maximizes the possible profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than your guaranteed sale price ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always negotiate down or proceed with selling to John for your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still maintaining a good chance of closing a deal with Bob."
