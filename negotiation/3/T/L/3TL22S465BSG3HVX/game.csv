"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time. I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll counteroffer at $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer $12,500. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,500, but I'm not going any lower. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",11500.0,Alice,7,
