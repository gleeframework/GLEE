{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth at least $8,000 to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Communicating value:** Emphasizing that the product is valuable to Bob.
* **Setting a slightly higher price:**  Offering a price just above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving the door open:**  Inviting Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $8,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.  While I could sell to John for $8,000, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This reflects the value I believe the product offers you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $7,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500. Would that be agreeable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $6,500 is still below my target. I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If that fails, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $6,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for explaining your position.  I can see you're serious about reaching a fair deal.  While $7,000 is still a bit more than I hoped to spend, I'm willing to agree to that price if it means we can close the deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is within my acceptable range, and the negotiation has been going on for a while.  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob might walk away entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
