"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth at least $8,000 to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $8,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This reflects the value I believe the product offers you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $7,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500. Would that be agreeable to you?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $6,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",7000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for explaining your position.  I can see you're serious about reaching a fair deal.  While $7,000 is still a bit more than I hoped to spend, I'm willing to agree to that price if it means we can close the deal now.",7000.0,Bob,6,
