"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. The product is worth $120 to you, and you can get it from John for that price. So, any price below $120 is a good deal. Alice's offer of $110 is a bit high, but we should see if we can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Alice has moved closer to my price, and $105 is a good deal considering I can get it from John for $120.  I'll take it!"
