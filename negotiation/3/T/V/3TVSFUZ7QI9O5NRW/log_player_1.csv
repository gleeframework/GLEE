"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's a significant step above your minimum ($80) but also leaves room for compromise if Bob counter-offers. It's important to be friendly and positive while setting the stage for a potentially profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, there's still room for a better deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great product, and I think it's worth the extra investment for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about $105? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get more,  $105 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over John's offer and we're nearing the end of the rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
