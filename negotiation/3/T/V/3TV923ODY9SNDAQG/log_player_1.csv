Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit but Stay Attractive:**  While you could start at $150 (your minimum), there's a chance Bob would reject it outright. Offering it at $140 tempts him with a deal while still securing you a significant profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 gives you a strong fallback position. You don't *need* to go below $140 unless Bob is particularly skilled at haggling."
