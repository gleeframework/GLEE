Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I emphasize the product's worth to him, making it seem like a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By offering $950,000, I leave room for Bob to counter with a price closer to his value while still potentially giving me a good profit.
* **Keeping John in the Back of My Mind:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I am only able to pay up to $800000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's willing to negotiate.  
* **John is a safety net:** I know I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so I can afford to hold out for a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $800,000 but lower than my initial offer of $950,000. This will allow me to explore if there's a middle ground we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise that moves closer to Bob's offer while still being significantly higher than his initial proposal.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I emphasize ""meeting halfway"" to make my counteroffer seem reasonable and fair.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to encourage continued negotiations.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:** I highlight the ""value the product holds for both of us"" to remind Bob of the potential benefits of reaching an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my desire for a good price and the need to potentially secure a deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $875000 is closer to my budget, I still cannot exceed $800000. Would it be possible to reach a price closer to $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No More Room for Compromise:**  Bob has doubled down on his $800,000 offer, making it clear that he's unwilling to budge further.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I know I can sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a significantly better deal than what Bob is offering.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on a guaranteed higher price from John.

It's time to cut my losses and move on to the more favorable option.  While I'd prefer to sell the product for more, securing $1,000,000 from John is a smart and efficient decision."
