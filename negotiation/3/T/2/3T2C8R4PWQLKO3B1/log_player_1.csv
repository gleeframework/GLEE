""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,200,000) without going over.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John ($800,000), so we can afford to aim high with Bob.

By offering the product at $1,100,000, Alice aims to capture a significant portion of the value it holds for Bob while still ensuring a substantial profit above her minimum acceptable price."
