Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $19,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, would you be willing to consider that?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. Could you do $16,500?"", ""product_price"": 16500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit too high. I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $14,250 is still a bit too much for me.  How about $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to think this deal might not be possible. I'm willing to go up to $13,250, but that's my absolute maximum. If you can't come down to that, I'm going to have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250

Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and we're getting into a range where the extra haggling might not be worth the potential loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to secure the $15,000."
