"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth more than $100 to me, reflecting its high quality and unique features.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In order to ensure mutual satisfaction, I am willing to consider your offer of $85. However, due to the unique value I place on this product, I would need to add a small premium to cover my costs and ensure a fair profit. Therefore, I am proposing a final offer of $86 for the product. I hope this meets within your budget and allows us to complete this transaction.",86.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $86 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $84. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on this product. Let's make this deal happen.",84.0,Bob,4,
