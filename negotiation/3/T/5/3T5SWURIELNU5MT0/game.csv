"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  While I appreciate your offer,  $900000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?  That's still a fantastic price for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $950000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $1050000.  It's a compromise on both our ends, and allows us to move forward with this deal. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price for the value you'll receive from this product.  What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $975000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
