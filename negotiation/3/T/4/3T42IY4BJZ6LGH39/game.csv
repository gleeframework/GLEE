"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would still leave you with a significant profit and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a counteroffer. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This price would still leave you with a considerable profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal while staying within my spending limit. Let's find a compromise here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $900,000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise one last time. I'm prepared to accept $975,000 for the product. This price is closer to your offer, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal and call it a day.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. It allows you to get a good deal while staying within my budget. Let's find common ground here and close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
