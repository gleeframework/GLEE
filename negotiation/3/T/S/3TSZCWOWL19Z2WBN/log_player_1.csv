I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the value to Bob, hoping to capture some of the surplus. I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, and we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $8,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping it will be enough to convince him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

This is a good outcome! Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price and is also the same as John's offer, so there's no advantage to going to the next round."
