"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,600,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that.  How about we settle on $1,450,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently moving towards a price that works for me. While selling to John is always an option, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right that we're getting closer. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,375,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I could push Bob further, his offer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of him walking away. Accepting now ensures a good profit without jeopardizing the deal."
