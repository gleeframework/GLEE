"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on it. However, I am currently working within a budget that allows me to spend up to $5000 on this purchase. I would like to propose an offer of $5000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your needs.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $5000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm confident this product is worth that investment.  I'll accept $7000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested.",7000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While $7000 is closer to what I'm comfortable spending, I still feel it might be a bit high. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? I propose an offer of $6000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations.",6000.0,Bob,4,
