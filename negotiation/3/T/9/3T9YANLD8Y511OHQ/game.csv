"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move closer to your price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $1,150,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
