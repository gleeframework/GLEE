"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than John's $100, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is still a good deal for me.  It's better than John's price of $100 and I'm comfortable with the price at this point."
