Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1250000. This would give you a good profit while still being within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
