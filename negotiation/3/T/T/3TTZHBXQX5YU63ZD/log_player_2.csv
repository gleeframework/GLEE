"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe it's a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $130 for this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about if I sell the product to you for $135? This is still a good deal considering the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise.  It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price point. Accepting this offer saves Bob $15 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and potentially needing to buy from John increases."
