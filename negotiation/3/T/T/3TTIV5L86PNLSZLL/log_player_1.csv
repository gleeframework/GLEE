{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, allowing you to benefit while ensuring a reasonable return on my investment. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, we don't want to start too low. There's room to negotiate, and beginning higher gives us that flexibility.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** Offering it at $1,150,000 ensures a significant profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly.  
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces that the price is justified. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. If his counter-offers remain too low, you always have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum price."
