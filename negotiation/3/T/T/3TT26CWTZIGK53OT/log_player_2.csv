"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. It signals Bob's seriousness in buying the product but establishes a lower price point that aligns with his goal of saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it once you have it.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely still get a better deal. He has already shown his willingness to negotiate and knows that Alice is motivated to sell. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially achieve a price closer to his desired $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $11,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both be happy with the deal.  Let's close this out."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating his flexibility and willingness to compromise. It also shows that he's serious about closing the deal while staying within his budget.  The message also emphasizes a fair deal for both parties, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting."
