"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves me with a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and confident, highlighting the value of the product and encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a relatively high price, I'm hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'll be watching Bob's response to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If Bob is hesitant, I might consider lowering the price a bit more in the next round. However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum price of $10,000.  While it's closer than his initial rejection, it's not yet acceptable.
* **Reason for rejection:**  I'm sticking to my minimum price and aiming for a higher profit.  I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob or at least get closer to my goal.
* **Next steps:**  I'll counteroffer in the next round, likely closer to his offer, but still above my minimum.  I'll also remind him of the value of the product and why it's worth a bit more.

**Strategy:**

I'm using a slow and steady approach to negotiation, starting with a high price and slowly working my way down while still maintaining a strong stance. This keeps Bob engaged and gives me more leverage in the negotiation. I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary, ensuring a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it once you have it.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a counteroffer at $12,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a firm stance.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefits Bob will get. I'm also using language that highlights the possibility of a win-win situation.
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to show Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to undervalue the product. By meeting him halfway, I'm hoping to reach a quick agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely watching Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll have to consider my next move based on how much lower he's willing to go. I'm prepared to lower my offer again, but only if I believe it's necessary to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $11,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both be happy with the deal.  Let's close this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is only $500 away from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $10,000.
* **Reason for accepting:** I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale and gain a decent profit. There's a good chance I can get a better price in the future by building a relationship with Bob, but it's not worth risking the sale at this point. 

**Strategy:**

I'm prioritizing getting a sale at this point, as I'm nearing the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a profit and avoid potentially having to sell at a lower price to John."
