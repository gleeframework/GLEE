"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. I'm proposing a new price of $11,500 for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle on $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, this time between $11,500 and $10,750. I'm proposing a new price of $11,125 for the product. What do you think?",11125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're tough! I'm trying my best to make this work.  How about $10,900? That's me trying to meet in the middle.",10900.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more move. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, this time between $11,125 and $10,900. I'm proposing a new price of $10,962.50 for the product. What do you think?",10962.5,Alice,7,
