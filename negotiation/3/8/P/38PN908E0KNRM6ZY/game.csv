"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than the market value. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to pay closer to $1000000. This is still a good deal for you, as you'd be making a profit, and it's my maximum budget. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 simply wouldn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1150000, which still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can make this work.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1075000? This would give you a significant profit and would be within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1075000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1125000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
