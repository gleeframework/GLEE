"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  He's shown interest and is willing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a willingness to compromise and his offer of $11,000 is closer to my desired price.  It's a good deal for both of us.  While I could potentially keep negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only the $10,000 offer from John.  It's better to secure the sale now."
