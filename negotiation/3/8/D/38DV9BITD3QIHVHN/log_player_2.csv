Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500. This is close to your last counteroffer and within your budget. There's a chance she might lower the price further, but it's risky to continue negotiating.  It's possible she won't budge further, and you could end up with a worse deal. It's best to accept this offer and secure the product within your budget."
