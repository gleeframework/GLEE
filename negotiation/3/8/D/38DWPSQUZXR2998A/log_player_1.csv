Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting at your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) establishes a firm anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Avoid Leaving Money on the Table:** While you know Bob values it at $8,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if he believes it's a unique opportunity.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's maximum willingness to pay. If you had more information, you might adjust your approach."
