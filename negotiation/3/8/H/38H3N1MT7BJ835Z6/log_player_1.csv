Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving him a bit of room to negotiate while still giving me a higher profit. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept an offer that is below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It is better to sell to Bob now than to risk further negotiations or sell to John for the same price."
