Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I think the product is worth at least that much to me, and I'm not willing to give it away for $11,000.

This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $11,500. Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away and forcing you to buy from John at the higher price. Accepting now secures a reasonable deal."
