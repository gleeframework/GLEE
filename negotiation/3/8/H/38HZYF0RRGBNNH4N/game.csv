"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $11,500 is closer, I'm hoping we can settle around $10,500.  Would that work for you?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I can see you're willing to pay more than $10,000, so I'll meet you halfway between $10,500 and $12,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,250. Let me know if that works for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the new offer.  I appreciate the movement. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,875?",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I think the product is worth more than $10,875, and I'm not willing to give away too much value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,875 and $12,000, but I'm going to take a slightly firmer stance this time. I'm offering the product to you for $11,375. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",11375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  It seems like we're getting close.  How about we settle this right now at $11,000 even?  That's my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I think the product is worth at least that much to me, and I'm not willing to give it away for $11,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,000. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,9,
