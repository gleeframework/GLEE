{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significant discount.  It's a bold move, but it signals that Bob is serious about getting a good deal. It's possible Alice will reject this offer, but it opens the door to further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price.  Continuing to negotiate is the best course of action to try and get closer to the $1,000,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer increases Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise while staying below Alice's current price.  It signals that Bob is serious about the purchase, and the offer is close enough to Alice's price that she might consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than Bob's desired price. While it would be ideal to get it for $1,000,000, the risk of continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate, and then Bob would have to pay $1,000,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point to secure the product and minimize the cost."
