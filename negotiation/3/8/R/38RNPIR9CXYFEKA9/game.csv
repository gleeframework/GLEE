"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm confident this product will bring you significant return, I can't go as low as $1,800,000. Would you consider $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $2,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",2000000.0,Bob,4,
