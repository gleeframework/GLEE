Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's justified considering my product's value to me.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm always prepared to sell to John for $800,000, but I want to maximize my profit if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the product's value.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob.  If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, $850,000 is a good compromise.  Bob is clearly not willing to go higher, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for $800,000. It's time to close the deal."
