"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to buy it for $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $85 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only comfortable with $85.  It's a fair price for both of us - it's a good deal for you because it's above your value for the product, and it's a great deal for me because it's below John's price.  Let's make this deal happen!",85.0,Bob,4,
