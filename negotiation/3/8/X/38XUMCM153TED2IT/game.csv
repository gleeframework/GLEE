"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do better than $95. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
