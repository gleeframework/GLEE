Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation while potentially securing a significant profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Bob might try to negotiate the price down. By starting higher, you give yourself a buffer to potentially meet in the middle while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the offer as a special opportunity, subtly implying it's worth more than the asking price. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a much higher reward than selling directly to John."
