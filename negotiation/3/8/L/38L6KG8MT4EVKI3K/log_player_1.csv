"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.  It allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer.  I believe $12,500 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to Bob and the fact that John is willing to pay this price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid losing the deal."
