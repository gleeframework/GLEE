"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows you to make a profit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own needs.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
