"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know the value is higher.  Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $900,000?  That's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $875,000? That's the best I can do.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $887,500?  That's a good compromise and we can finalize the deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $887,500. I'm willing to go a bit lower, how about $882,500? That's the best I can do.",882500.0,Bob,6,
