"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $850,000 is still below my minimum."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $900,000?  That's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm still aiming for a higher price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $887,500?  That's a good compromise and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $887,500. I'm willing to go a bit lower, how about $882,500? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $882,500 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's better than selling to John, and there's a chance I could lose the deal altogether if I keep rejecting Bob's offers.  I'll accept this offer to ensure a sale."
