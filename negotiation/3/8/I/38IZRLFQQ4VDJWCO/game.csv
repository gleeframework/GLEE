"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're still a bit apart, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer willing to pay the full price of $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
