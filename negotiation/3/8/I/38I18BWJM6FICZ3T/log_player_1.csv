"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, leaving room for negotiation but still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking for a product within my budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial budget of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can negotiate a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. Considering my budget, would $100 be a reasonable price for you to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $100 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $115 to close this deal.  Let's be reasonable here, I'm already taking a big hit for you."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Given my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $105? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is tempting, I'm still losing money at that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for a loss just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is the lowest I can go, but it's still a good deal for you. Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Could we possibly settle on $107? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a price that's closer to my minimum value.  While $107 is a decent offer, it's still a significant loss for me.  I'm going to sell to John for $150, as it's the most profitable option at this point."
