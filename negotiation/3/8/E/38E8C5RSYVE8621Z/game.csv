"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll see its potential. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
