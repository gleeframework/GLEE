"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this price still reflects the value I see in the product, but I'm trying to be a bit more conservative with my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us,  $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,112,500?  This reflects a willingness to negotiate on my end while still valuing the product fairly.",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,075,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,075,000 as a final offer? I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
