"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not quite willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $140, though. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference and do $120? That seems fair to me.",120.0,Bob,4,,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $120. I can do $145, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good deal for you. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,,
