,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $90 for it, since I know you're willing to sell it for less. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
