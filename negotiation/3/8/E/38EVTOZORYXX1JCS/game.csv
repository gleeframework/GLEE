"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $12,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Could you meet me in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,875? This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to be happy with the deal.",11875.0,Alice,5,
