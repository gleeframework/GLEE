"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit tight on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a good price, $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll still find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
