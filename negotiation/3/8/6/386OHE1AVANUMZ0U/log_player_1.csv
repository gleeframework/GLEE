Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit tight on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
