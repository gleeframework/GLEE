"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.  This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking to get a good deal. The offer of $9,500 leaves a $500 difference between Bob's offer and Alice's desired price, which allows for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,500 to close this deal. Let's make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  Even though it's closer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should continue to try and get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500. How about $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his maximum price point, demonstrating his seriousness in buying the product but also his unwillingness to go higher. This is a strong position for Bob as it puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or potentially lose the deal."
