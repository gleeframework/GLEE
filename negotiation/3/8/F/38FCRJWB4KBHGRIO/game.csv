"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $8,000 to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go down to $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. I can't go all the way to $8,750, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get a little closer to my asking price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but I think we can do better than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,250. Please let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",8250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I need to be able to make a decent profit on this sale.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a way to close this deal.",8750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $8,500, but I need to know if that's something you'd be willing to accept. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,8,
