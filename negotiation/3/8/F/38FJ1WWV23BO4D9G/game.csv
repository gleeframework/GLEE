"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
