{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product and sets a positive tone.  

By starting a bit higher, we aim to maximize our profit while giving Bob room to counter. Remember, we can always fall back on selling to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value is $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's significantly below our minimum threshold of $1,200,000. We're in a strong position to negotiate further, and our fallback option with John ensures we can secure a much better price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think it's a reasonable price considering the market value is $1000000 and your original price was $1200000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below our minimum threshold of $1,200,000. We're committed to maximizing our profit and John provides a guaranteed sale at a much more favorable price. It's time to move on from Bob."
