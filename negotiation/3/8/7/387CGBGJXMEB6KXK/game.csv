"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
