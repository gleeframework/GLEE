Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $15,000, it hints at the product's value. This opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, and you can gauge his interest level.
* **Alternative:** Mentioning that you have another buyer (John) might pressure Bob, but it could also backfire if he calls your bluff. It's a riskier strategy in this scenario."
