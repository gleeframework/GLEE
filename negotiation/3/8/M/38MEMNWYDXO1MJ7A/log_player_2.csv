"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,100,000
* **Your maximum price:** $1,200,000
* **John's price:** $1,200,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your counter-offer and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price is present."
