"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? ",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $13,000. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, I can't go lower than $13,500.  This is still a significant discount for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my minimum price.  What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,5,
