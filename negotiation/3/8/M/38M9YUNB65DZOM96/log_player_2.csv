"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, immediately stating his maximum budget. This lets Alice know that he's serious about getting a deal but also provides space for some negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $13,000. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his budget but showing a willingness to compromise. Offering $12,500 shows that he's serious about buying the product, but still trying to save money. This offer is also a good starting point for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, I can't go lower than $13,500.  This is still a significant discount for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my minimum price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his budget limit. While Alice has come down to $13,500, Bob is still over his budget. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget and saves some money compared to Alice's final offer."
