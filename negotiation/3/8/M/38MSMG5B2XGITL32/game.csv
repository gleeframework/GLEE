"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my counteroffer.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your operations. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250.
