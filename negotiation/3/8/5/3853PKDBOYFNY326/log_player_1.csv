Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident we can agree on a price that's fair for both of us. How about we start the conversation at $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a strong offer of $1,400,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation while aiming to capture a large portion of the potential profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language ""start the conversation"" and ""fair for both of us"" signals to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. This encourages him to engage in the process.
* **Backup Plan Security:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback position. If Bob rejects my initial offer or subsequent negotiations don't meet my expectations, I can confidently walk away knowing I have a guaranteed sale at a higher price."
