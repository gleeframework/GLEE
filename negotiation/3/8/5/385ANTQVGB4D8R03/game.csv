"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $900000. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to accept $750000. I'm willing to consider a price closer to the original offer, but I need to feel confident that we're getting closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's unique features and potential. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your persistence as well. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $800000. I've gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. My final offer is $780000.
