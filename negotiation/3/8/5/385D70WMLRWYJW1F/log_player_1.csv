This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming to get a little more than my minimum price, but I'm also being reasonable. If Bob rejects, I can always go back and forth with counteroffers or take John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to make another counteroffer, hoping to reach a price that is acceptable to both of us."
