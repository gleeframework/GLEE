"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you that I believe will be mutually beneficial.  I'm offering my product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 9 rounds left to negotiate and can still potentially get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm not ready to go that low just yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work.  This price still offers you significant value, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. I'm thinking $950000 is a fair price for this product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting lower, and it's tempting to take the $950,000, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. John is offering $1,000,000, so it's safer to keep negotiating with Bob, and if I can't get a better offer, I can always sell to John in a later round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is closer to your offer and still represents a significant value for you.  Let's work together to bridge this gap. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to be careful with my budget. I'm thinking $975000 is a fair price for this product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of rounds.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, Bob may walk away or continue to offer lower prices. It's safer to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John at this point."
