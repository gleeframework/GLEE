""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,999 creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob, while maximizing my potential profit.  

It's highly unlikely Bob will accept a price above his valuation knowing I have another buyer. This offer tempts him while ensuring I don't lose money if he declines."
