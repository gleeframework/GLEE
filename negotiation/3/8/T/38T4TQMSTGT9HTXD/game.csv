"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and the market value. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you and the market value. It's a compromise that should be beneficial for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000 for the product. This price reflects the value to me and offers you a significant profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,325,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,375,000. This price is a good compromise, considering the value to you and the market value. It's a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
