"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great deal for you considering the market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can use the information about Alice's value ($1,200,000) to guide your counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you and the market value. It's a compromise that should be beneficial for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still slightly above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You can leverage the fact that Alice rejected your counteroffer to push for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000 for the product. This price reflects the value to me and offers you a significant profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,325,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,375,000. This price is a good compromise, considering the value to you and the market value. It's a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your preferred maximum of $1,350,000.  You've already made two counteroffers, and Alice has rejected both.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high. It's more prudent to purchase the product from John for $1,500,000. You'll be paying more, but you'll be certain to secure the product and avoid further negotiation."
