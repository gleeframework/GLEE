"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer on this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're working with a budget, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is the best I can do for now.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $1200000. I'm really hoping we can meet at this price. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're very interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to purchasing it. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1280000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $1280000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1240000 for the product.",1240000.0,Bob,6,
