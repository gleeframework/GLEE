"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
