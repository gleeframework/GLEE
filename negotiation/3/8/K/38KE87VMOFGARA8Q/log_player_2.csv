"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. I've assessed its worth to you at $1,200,000, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that reflects both its value and a fair deal for both of us.  My offer is $1,000,000. This price allows for significant profit for you while still ensuring a substantial return on my investment.  Consider this a unique opportunity to secure a product that aligns perfectly with your goals. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to gauge how high you'd be willing to go. She starts at $1,000,000, which is a significant markup from its value to her ($800,000). By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This opens the door for further negotiation with Alice, potentially securing a lower price closer to your limit or even below."
