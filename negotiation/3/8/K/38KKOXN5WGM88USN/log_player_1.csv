Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. He might value the convenience of getting it now over trying to find a similar product elsewhere.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, asking for a price too close to your guaranteed sale price might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal, decreasing the likelihood of him accepting."
