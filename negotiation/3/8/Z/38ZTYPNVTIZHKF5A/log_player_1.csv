Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** $11,500 is still less than my minimum value ($12,000), so I can potentially accept a counteroffer if it's close.
* **Maintaining flexibility:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can always go back to John, who will pay my minimum.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:**  Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't obligate me to continue negotiating with him. I can always switch to John if the negotiation with Bob fails to reach a satisfactory price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I maintain control of the negotiation and keep the possibility of a better deal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  My counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise, coming down from my initial $11,500 but still above Bob's $10,000.  
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  I highlight that the price is still a good deal for him, reinforcing the product's value and encouraging him to accept.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  I'm not giving in completely, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. I'm also still open to selling to John for $12,000 if this negotiation falls through. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between meeting Bob halfway while still protecting my own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I am still unable to exceed $10,000 for the product. I believe $10,000 is a fair price given its value to me. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is non-negotiable:**  Bob has made it clear he won't go above $10,000, and there's no indication he's willing to budge.  
* **My minimum value:**  $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. 

It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point.  Selling to John ensures I get the best possible deal and avoid a financial loss."
