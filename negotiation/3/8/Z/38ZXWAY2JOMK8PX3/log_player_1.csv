Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is closer to the value Bob places on the product ($120). This gives me more room to negotiate if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to make Bob feel comfortable and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The price of $100 still gives me a decent profit ($20) while leaving space for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling like I'm losing too much. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $80 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($80), I'm not in a rush and see room for further negotiation.  

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $100 by counter-offering. 
* **No Immediate Loss:**  Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't harm me. I can still counter-offer or sell to John for $80 as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer!  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is the lowest I can go.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm counter-offering with $90, which is still a good profit for me and closer to my initial desired price.
* **Maintain Negotiation:** This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also that I value the product. 
* **Reiterate Interest:**  I acknowledge Bob's interest to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already counter-offered twice.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price, and there's a risk of losing Bob entirely. 

* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag things out. Selling to John now guarantees me my minimum price without any further delay or uncertainty. 
* **No Loss:**  Selling to John for $80 is the same as accepting Bob's offer.  It's the best outcome at this point."
