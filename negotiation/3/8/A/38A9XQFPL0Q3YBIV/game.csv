,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $9,500.  I think that's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's make a deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
