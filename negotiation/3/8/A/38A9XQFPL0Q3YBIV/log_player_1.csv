{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also allows for a possibility of reaching an agreement without having to rely on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but still within a range that makes further negotiation worthwhile. It's important to explore a possible deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $9,500.  I think that's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. There's still room for further negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for $9,500 just yet. I'll try to counteroffer once more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
