"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know you value it at $1,000,000, and this price gives you a good margin.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer. This could be a tactic to pressure you. 
* You know John will sell you the product for $1,000,000. There's no reason to pay Alice $100,000 more. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John at your desired price."
