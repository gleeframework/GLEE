I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite, and then we can adjust from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$1,200,000 is way too low for me. I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm coming down a bit, but still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  Hopefully, this counteroffer is reasonable enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

$1,400,000 is a good compromise. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than selling to John and I still make a good profit. I'm happy to close the deal with Bob."
