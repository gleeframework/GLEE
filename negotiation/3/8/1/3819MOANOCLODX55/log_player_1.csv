Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $100 to you!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$115:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob.

This strategy allows me to potentially earn more than $120 from John if Bob accepts the offer.  However, it also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate further if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $100 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell the product for less than that. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's still a great price for a product worth more than $100 to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$110:** This is a compromise price, halfway between my initial offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $100.  
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob while also demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 

This counteroffer allows me to explore a middle ground and potentially close the deal with Bob without dropping below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to go above $100 for the product. Would it be possible to reach an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go above $100.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a strong chance this will lead to a protracted process with no guarantee of a higher price. 

Since John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's more advantageous to sell to him.  This ensures a quick and profitable sale without risking a lower price with Bob."
