Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the product's worth to me while also leaving room for a fair deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
