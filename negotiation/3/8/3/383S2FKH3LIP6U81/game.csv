"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds immense value for you as well. To start, I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the product's worth to me while also leaving room for a fair deal for you. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
