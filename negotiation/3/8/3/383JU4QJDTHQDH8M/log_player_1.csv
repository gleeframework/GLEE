{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **""Great deal"":** This phrase is used to create a sense of urgency and entice Bob to accept the offer.
* **""Very valuable"":** This highlights the product's worth to Bob, making the offer more appealing.

**Reasoning:**

* I want to maximize my profit, but I also want to reach a deal with Bob if possible. 
* Starting at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value gives him room to negotiate but leaves a comfortable margin for me.
* This offer allows me to assess Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better price than I would with John.
* If Bob rejects, I can then counter-offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to get a better deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.
