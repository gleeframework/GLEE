"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $11,500,  which is closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,500, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,6,
