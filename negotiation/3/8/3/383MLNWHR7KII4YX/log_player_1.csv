"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I could accept his offer and get some money, it's not worth it to sell at such a low price. There's still potential for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not ready to settle yet, especially since I can sell to John for $15,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $11,500,  which is closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,500, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my desired price point, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation.  While I could continue, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and potentially having to lower my price even further is too high. It's time to secure the sale with John for $15,000 and avoid further risk."
