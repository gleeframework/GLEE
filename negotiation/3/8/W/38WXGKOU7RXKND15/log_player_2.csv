# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get the price down further."

Alice's offer:

You can still try to get a lower price. $122 is closer to your target, but you can likely negotiate further."
