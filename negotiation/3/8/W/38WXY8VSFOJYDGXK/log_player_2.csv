"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $125. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $125 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than $125, you can likely get the price down even further. It's still worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $120 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $115?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet at $122.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could try to negotiate further, Alice is getting closer to her minimum price. Accepting her offer of $122.50 is still a good deal for you and saves you money compared to buying from John."
