Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price, but it's not so high that it will immediately scare Bob off. I'll be ready to negotiate if needed, but I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested at this price point first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $18,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try and counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $19,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a bit higher than Bob's offer. I hope this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but that I'm also not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally get closer to my initial asking price, $17,500 is still a decent profit and above my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob and ending up with the lower price from John.  It's time to close the deal."
