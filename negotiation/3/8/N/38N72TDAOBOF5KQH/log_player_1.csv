Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You're aware that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, giving you leverage in the negotiation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 aims to maximize your profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($2,000). 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's a risk that Bob might reject the $10,000 offer. However, the potential for a $2,000 profit over your guaranteed $8,000 from John makes this risk worthwhile. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price that's attractive to Bob while ensuring a significant profit for you."
