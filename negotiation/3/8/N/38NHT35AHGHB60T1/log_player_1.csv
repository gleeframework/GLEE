"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price to see if Bob is willing to pay something closer to my value. I want to keep the negotiation going, but also start strong and see if he's ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low offer. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $110. This is a fair price that's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a reasonable amount."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still a bit far from my target. Can we try $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $95 is still too low.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Can we try $85? I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price and it seems unlikely that we will reach an agreement. With only a few rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I get a price that's worth my time and effort."
