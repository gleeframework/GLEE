Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent profit, it's still lower than my initial goal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm not desperate to sell, as I have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a good profit. It's also a bit higher than Bob's offer, hoping he sees the value and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough to justify further negotiation. I'm now at a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing time and ultimately ending up with a lower offer.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which is a safe and guaranteed deal."
