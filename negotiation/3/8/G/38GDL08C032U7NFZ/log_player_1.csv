{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit. 
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** $100 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, so he has an incentive to buy it.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still negotiate upwards if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

By starting at $100, you're setting a firm price while leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price I'm willing to pay for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's not ideal. You can likely get more. By rejecting his offer, you can try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $80 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $90. That still leaves me some profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $87.50 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over his initial offer of $80, and it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  Accepting this offer allows me to make a decent profit while avoiding the risk of losing the sale entirely."
