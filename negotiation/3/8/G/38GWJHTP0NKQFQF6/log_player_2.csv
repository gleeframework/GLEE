Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. Let's find a middle ground - how about we consider $1,700,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your initial interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand where you're coming from, but $1,250,000 is still a significant gap from what I believe is a fair reflection of its value. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is insistent on a price that is significantly higher than your limit. Even though she says it's her final offer, it's unlikely she'll let the deal fall through completely. However, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation, as she might become even more firm in her price. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
