"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1200000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can see the value this product can bring to your business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let's discuss the details.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1200000, so I'm offering $1050000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're making a serious effort to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to meet my minimum. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1150000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000, but I need you to meet me at this price. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1150000. I'm willing to make a new offer that's closer to your target, but I need you to meet me at $1100000. This is the last concession I can make, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1100000, so I'm offering $975000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit far apart, Bob. I understand that $975000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm thinking of $1075000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious effort to negotiate a fair price, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1050000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Bob,10,
