"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This would be a good compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This would allow both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800.  If we can close the deal at this price, it would be a good outcome for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $8,800 is a good offer. However, I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This would allow us to both find a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",8900.0,Alice,7,
