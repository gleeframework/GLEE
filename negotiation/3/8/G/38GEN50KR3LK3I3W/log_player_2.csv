"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Since Bob has the option to purchase from John for $8,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice in the hopes of getting a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a price closer to his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This would allow both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob is aiming for the best possible price and knows he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives him more room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800.  If we can close the deal at this price, it would be a good outcome for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $8,800 is a good offer. However, I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This would allow us to both find a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While Bob has tried to negotiate a lower price, it's clear that Alice is not willing to go below $8,900.  Rather than continue negotiating and risk Alice raising her price again, it's in Bob's best interest to purchase the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees Bob gets the product at his desired price and avoids further negotiation."
