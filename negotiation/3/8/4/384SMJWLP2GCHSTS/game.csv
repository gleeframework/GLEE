"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 is a fair offer, the product's value is  considerably higher for someone like you who can maximize its potential. I could let it go for $10,500.  I think that's a very competitive price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable paying $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I can get from the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
