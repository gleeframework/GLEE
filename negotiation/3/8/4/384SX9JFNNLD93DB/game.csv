"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm.  However,  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider $9000? I believe that's a fair price considering my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value and uniqueness.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit steep for me. How about $10000? I'm truly interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $11250 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm hoping we can meet at $10750.

I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I have to stick to my budget.",10750.0,Bob,8,
