"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  It's priced at $1,200,000, reflecting its unique value. Let's discuss how this can benefit your business.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it brings. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, I believe I can still push for a higher price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value your interest, $950,000 is a bit lower than what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's exceptional value and allows you a good margin for profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. This price aligns better with my financial planning while still acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum price requirement. Selling to John would yield the same amount, but I'm more comfortable closing the deal with Bob, as this negotiation has already been fruitful.  There's no guarantee that John will be available for future deals, and Bob seems like a potential recurring customer."
