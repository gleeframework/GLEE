"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,750,000. I know this is a bit higher than its value to you, but it's still significantly less than what I could get elsewhere. This is a one-time opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Consider it a strategic investment with potential for future returns. Let me know if you're interested.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
