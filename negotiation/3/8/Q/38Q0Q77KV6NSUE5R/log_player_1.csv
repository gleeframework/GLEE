Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This will allow room for negotiation while still giving me a profit. I'm confident that I can get a good price, as Bob is willing to pay up to $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price. I am confident that I can negotiate a higher price, as Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to pay more than $7,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This price is still higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my desired price. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this counteroffer, as it's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident that I can negotiate a higher price. I will sell the product to John for $8,000. This will ensure that I get a fair price for the product and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
