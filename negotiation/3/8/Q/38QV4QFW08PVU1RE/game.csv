,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate it, $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  However, $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to offer you $100, which is a fair price considering I can get it elsewhere for $80.  What do you say?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway earlier, and I'm not willing to give up more value. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you.",115.0,Alice,5,
