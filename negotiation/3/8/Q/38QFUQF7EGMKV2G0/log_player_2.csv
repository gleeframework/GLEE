"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great investment for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a good value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing your seriousness in negotiating while also leaving room for potential compromise. It's a starting point for a discussion that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1000000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly your maximum budget, meaning you can buy the product and stay within your limit. While you might prefer a lower price, it's a reasonable offer given the product's value to Alice and the possibility that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or an even higher counteroffer from Alice.  It's time to close the deal."
