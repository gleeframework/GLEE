Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, aiming for a good profit. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a good value for you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
