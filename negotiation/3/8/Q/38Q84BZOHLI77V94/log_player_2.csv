Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,240,000.

It's clear Alice is not budging significantly.  We've been going back and forth, and she's now back up to her original offer of $1,300,000. It's not worth the risk of her not coming down further in the last round. John's offer, while not ideal, guarantees I stay within my budget."
