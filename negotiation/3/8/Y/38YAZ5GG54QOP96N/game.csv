"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and rarity.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000, and I'm starting to think that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: I'll sell the product to you for $12000, but I need a firm commitment from you that this is the price you're willing to pay. If I don't hear back from you, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
