"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I get a good price, closer to my desired value of $1,200,000.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1380000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with $1,280,000, it's only $80,000 less than my minimum and only two rounds remain.  It's getting riskier to keep negotiating with Bob, especially since John is waiting in the wings.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
