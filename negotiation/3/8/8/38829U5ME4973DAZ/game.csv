"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that works for everyone.  I'm starting with $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $800,000 is simply too low.  It's important to recognize the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $950,000 for it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  $950,000 is a good offer, but I'm still holding firm on my last offer of $1,000,000. This product is worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price that reflects its value.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price for the product. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll offer $920,000 for it.",920000.0,Bob,6,
