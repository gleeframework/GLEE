"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $87.50 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference again, how about $88.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",88.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close! $86.25 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $87?  This is a fair price, and we can finally close this deal.",87.0,Alice,7,
