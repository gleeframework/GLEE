Don't miss out on this unique opportunity to enhance your experience with our product. Let us know if you have any questions or if you'd like to proceed with the purchase.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's sales pitch is tempting, her offer of $14,000 is still more than your maximum budget of $12,000. You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can simply proceed with your backup plan of buying from John and saving $2,000."
