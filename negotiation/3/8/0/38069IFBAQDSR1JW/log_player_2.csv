"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to signal that you're serious about the negotiation but won't accept a price anywhere near her initial offer.  We'll counter with a much lower number to start moving the price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, that price is simply not feasible for me. This product holds value for me, but not at that level. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This offer reflects my serious interest while recognizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is quite significant. I'm confident this product can generate substantial value, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to see a price that reflects its true potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's price is coming down, but it's still way too high. We need to show her we're willing to walk away if she doesn't become more reasonable. We'll counteroffer again, but we won't move too much closer to her price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  This product is valuable to me, but not at that premium.  To show I'm serious about reaching a deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let's try to find some common ground here."",
""product_price"": 950000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I see you're serious about acquiring this product. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal. It represents a fair price that acknowledges the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has made a more substantial move, but it's still not within a range we're comfortable with.  We need to continue pushing downwards, but it's time to start increasing our offer at a slower pace to signal that we are reaching our upper limit.  We'll need to gauge her response carefully in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate is encouraging.  However, $1,650,000 remains a significant investment for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I see you're recognizing the inherent value of this product. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,400,000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a very fair offer considering the potential this product holds.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a crucial moment. Alice is putting on the pressure with a ""final offer,"" but it's still considerably higher than our backup option with John. We need to call her bluff, but also show we're willing to meet her somewhere in the middle if she's truly serious.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but calling $1,400,000 your 'best price'  makes this difficult.  While I'm serious about acquiring the product, I have to be mindful of my budget.  I'm willing to stretch to $1,200,000, but that's truly as high as I can go.  This offer represents a significant investment for me and acknowledges the value I place on this product.  Let's get this done."",
