"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, that price is simply not feasible for me. This product holds value for me, but not at that level. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This offer reflects my serious interest while recognizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is quite significant. I'm confident this product can generate substantial value, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to see a price that reflects its true potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  This product is valuable to me, but not at that premium.  To show I'm serious about reaching a deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let's try to find some common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I see you're serious about acquiring this product. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal. It represents a fair price that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate is encouraging.  However, $1,650,000 remains a significant investment for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I see you're recognizing the inherent value of this product. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,400,000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a very fair offer considering the potential this product holds.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but calling $1,400,000 your 'best price'  makes this difficult.  While I'm serious about acquiring the product, I have to be mindful of my budget.  I'm willing to stretch to $1,200,000, but that's truly as high as I can go.  This offer represents a significant investment for me and acknowledges the value I place on this product.  Let's get this done.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
