Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a compromise price. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob a good deal while still ensuring I make a decent profit.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the benefits for Bob, increasing the chance of acceptance. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit by:

* **Securing a sale:**  Offering a price Bob is likely to accept, instead of risking a rejection and having to sell to John.
* **Getting a higher price:**  $12,000 is still a significant profit for me, even though it's lower than my ideal price."
