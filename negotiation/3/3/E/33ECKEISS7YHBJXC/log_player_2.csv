"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $12,000. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose an initial price of $11,000. This is a special offer tailored just for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, there's potential to get an even better price. It's worth exploring further negotiation rounds to see if Alice is willing to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain a reasonable margin for myself. Therefore, I propose a price of $10,500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer.  $10,500 is a good deal for Bob, as it saves him $1,500 compared to buying from John.  There's always the risk of negotiating further, but at this point, the savings are substantial, and there's no guarantee Alice will lower the price further.  It's a good time to accept and secure the deal."
