Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I believe will be mutually beneficial.  Would you be interested in discussing a potential purchase at $900,000? "", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with an offer of $900,000, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  My message emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob, making him think about its worth to him. 
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussion, suggesting a willingness to compromise. 

This approach balances the need to get the highest possible price while also considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and leaving me with the fallback option of selling to John."
