"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering what it can do for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is quite high. I could meet you halfway at $10,250. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's still below his maximum price of $12,000 and significantly lower than the initial offer of $11,000. There's little to gain by continuing the negotiation and risking Alice withdrawing her offer entirely."
