# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. This item holds significant value to me, but I understand its worth to you is $8,000. Considering its unique features and the quality it offers, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire it at a special price of $9,500. This is a fair deal that respects both the value I place on the product and your budget. I believe this is an excellent chance for you to benefit from its capabilities without exceeding your financial limits. I look forward to your positive response.

While Alice's offer is a bit closer to my perceived value, John offers the product at my absolute maximum price. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the $1,500."
