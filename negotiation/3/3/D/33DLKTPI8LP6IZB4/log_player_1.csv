"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. This price also sets a baseline for Bob's understanding of the product's potential value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by dropping the price to $18,000. This shows flexibility and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. It also keeps the price above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  He's come up to $16,500, which is significantly closer to my desired price than $15,000. While I could try to negotiate further, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer, and I'm not comfortable with the risk of losing the sale entirely.  $16,500 is a good profit, and I'm happy to close the deal."
