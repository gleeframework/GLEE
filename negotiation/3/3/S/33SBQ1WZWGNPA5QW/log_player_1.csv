I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000.  The negotiations with Bob have stalled, and while his offer is close to my minimum, I don't want to risk further rounds and potentially lose the deal entirely.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John than to risk ending up with nothing."
