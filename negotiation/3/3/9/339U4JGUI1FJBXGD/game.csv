"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming to secure this product for a bit less. Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1200000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1300000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm ready to close the deal right now for $1250000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing us to make a profitable transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
