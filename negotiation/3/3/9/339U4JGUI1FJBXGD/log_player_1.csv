{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value of this product to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's still more than what I can get from John. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming to secure this product for a bit less. Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1200000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is still a good profit, it's far from the $1,400,000 I initially offered. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1300000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm ready to close the deal right now for $1250000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing us to make a profitable transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,300,000, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still a good deal. It's a significant profit for me, and it's likely that further negotiation might not lead to a significantly higher price. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and secure a substantial amount of money."
