# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your last offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is still a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value you place on it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is a factor:**  Bob has only 3 rounds left. 
* **Alice's compromise:** Alice is demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.  This is a good sign that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.
* **Value for Bob:**  While $1,050,000 is higher than Bob's desired price, it's still a significant saving compared to buying from John. 

It's a calculated risk. Bob could try to negotiate further, but the potential for a better deal might be outweighed by the risk of losing the product altogether or running out of time."
