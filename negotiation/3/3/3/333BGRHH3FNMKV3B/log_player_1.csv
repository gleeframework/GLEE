{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value and your potential gain. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Start high:**  $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum desired price ($1,200,000) than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Be reasonable:** It's still a significant discount for Bob, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Set the stage for counteroffers:**  I expect Bob to counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his seriousness and potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, potentially going lower if necessary, or using John's offer as a benchmark for ending negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1100000. I am willing to pay up to $950000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, and even below my initial offer of $1,100,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe there's still potential for a better negotiation. I'm willing to lower my price, but not to that extent.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed alternative with John, which gives me leverage in this negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum desired price but also keeping in mind Bob's budget constraints. I will carefully consider the value of my product and how much I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. I'm confident this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I've lowered my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, effectively meeting Bob halfway. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.
* **Testing Bob's commitment:** This counteroffer tests if Bob is truly interested in the product and is willing to pay closer to its actual value. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully monitor Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1025000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, making it a very good deal for me.
* **Potential for future collaborations:** Accepting Bob's offer could establish a positive relationship for potential future transactions.
* **Time and effort:**  Further negotiation might be time-consuming and could lead to a lower price, or even a failed deal. 

**Conclusion:**

While selling to John for $1,200,000 would be ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $1,025,000 seems like the best course of action considering the proximity to my desired price and the potential benefits of a positive relationship with Bob."
