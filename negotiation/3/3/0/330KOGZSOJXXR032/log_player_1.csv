I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $100.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  It's too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum value of $100. I'm hoping this will be a more attractive offer to Bob, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already gone down to $95 and don't want to go any lower.  It's better to sell to John at $100 and secure a guaranteed profit."
