This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **You're getting a significant discount:**  You're buying the product for $1,080,000, which is well below your $1,500,000 limit and a good saving compared to John's price.
* **Alice is unlikely to go much lower:** She's already made several concessions and stated she needs to get at least $1,200,000.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you push too hard, you risk Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
