Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've stated your minimum is $8,000, so this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  A $500 difference is a good starting point for a negotiation, and it might lead to a quick agreement.

**Important:** This is just an initial offer.  Be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response and your own goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still a little below your ideal price.  You've already made a concession in your initial offer.  Rejecting Bob's counteroffer allows you to:

* **Maintain your bargaining power:** You haven't given up ground yet.  
* **Potentially get closer to your ideal price:** A counteroffer gives you the chance to explore a higher price point.  

**Next Step:**

You should counter Bob's offer, potentially with something like: ""$8,750.""  This keeps the negotiation moving while keeping in mind your minimum and Bob's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750? This allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Compromise:**  It's a smaller step down from your previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Stay above your minimum:** $8,750 is still above your $8,000 minimum.
* **Test the waters:** It gauges Bob's willingness to go higher, potentially leading to a faster agreement.

Remember, it's important to be firm yet flexible in your negotiations.  Be prepared to adjust your counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I would like to propose a price of $8,600 to ensure we both benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,600 is very close to your minimum price of $8,000. While it's still not your ideal price, it's a good deal considering you have the option of selling to John for $8,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection. 
* **Time efficiency:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag out the process and potentially lead to a lower price.
* **Fair compromise:** A price of $8,600 is a fair compromise considering your minimum and Bob's willingness to pay. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy to ensure a quick and profitable sale."
