"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it holds great value for your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the product as a valuable opportunity for Bob's business to entice him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by stating ""Let me know your thoughts!"" to encourage a counteroffer. 

This approach allows me to maximize my potential earnings while leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.** I'm not willing to sell for less than that, as I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a better price.**  I have 9 rounds left, so there's still time to explore other options.
* **I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and if he's willing to increase his offer.** 

By rejecting the offer, I signal to Bob that I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not walking away. This shows Bob I'm serious about a deal, but also that I won't be taken advantage of.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing flexibility.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Open-ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and hopefully get Bob to budge a bit more. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between being firm and accommodating, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but no more. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Need to Risk:**  Since John is offering the same amount, there's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lower the price. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting the offer saves time and effort, allowing me to finalize the deal quickly. 

While I might be able to potentially get a slightly higher price with more rounds, the risk of losing the deal entirely or getting a lower offer outweighs the potential reward. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the minimum I want and ensures a successful transaction."
