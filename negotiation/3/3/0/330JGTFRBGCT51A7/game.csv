"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1250000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to gain a substantial asset at a price that's well below its true value. Consider this my best offer, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1000000. Let me know your decision.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
