"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $12,000. This is a one-time opportunity to get a unique item that's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. There's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice or find a similar product elsewhere for less."
