"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is not terrible, it's below my minimum value of $80. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get a better price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm countering with $85.  This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price while still ensuring I get at least my minimum value.  Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum value, so I will accept it. This ensures that I get at least my minimum, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on this deal."
