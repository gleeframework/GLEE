"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is your maximum value for the product, there's no reason to accept the first offer. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, and Alice's initial price doesn't give you any information about her bottom line.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This signals my intent to negotiate and gives Alice some room to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much.  I'm hoping this will start a back-and-forth that leads to a price closer to my ideal value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to my maximum value, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is showing a willingness to come down from her initial price, but I'm not convinced this is her final offer. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $80.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a price closer to my target. It's a smaller step than the previous round, suggesting a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will get Alice to accept or at least make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
