"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is worth $1,500,000 to me. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer, Alice.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $950,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget constraints. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
