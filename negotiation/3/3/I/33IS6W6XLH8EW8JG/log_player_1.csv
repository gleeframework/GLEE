Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and believe I can get a higher price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer."
