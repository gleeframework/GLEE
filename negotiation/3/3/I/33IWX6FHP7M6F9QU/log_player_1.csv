"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum value ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The price is not my absolute minimum, which allows for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I was thinking of offering $80 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is a starting point, it's still below my minimum value of $120.  Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Room for negotiation:** I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price point and still potentially get a better deal than selling to John. 
* **Gaining information:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to see how flexible Bob is and potentially get him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This offer is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a profit.
* **Positive framing:**  Again, the message is positive and emphasizes the value for Bob, making it more appealing. 
* **Leaving room for one more counteroffer:**  If Bob rejects, I can still make a final counteroffer before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to offer $90 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm still within the negotiation rounds and can try to squeeze out a bit more.
* **Gaining information:**  Rejecting gives me another chance to see if Bob is willing to go higher. If he's not, I can then confidently sell to John.
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's still a chance Bob might be willing to go up to $95, which would be a more profitable deal for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $92.50 for the product. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final counteroffer before I default to selling to John. 
* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer, showing I'm flexible but not willing to go much lower.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal to incentivize Bob to accept. 
* **Setting a clear expectation:** This leaves Bob with one clear decision: accept or reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to offer $88 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $88 is now below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited rounds:**  With only four rounds remaining, the likelihood of Bob increasing his offer significantly is slim.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit. 

Even though I'm losing out on potentially earning more if Bob had agreed to a higher price, it's more prudent to secure the guaranteed profit with John at this point. Continuing the negotiation risks losing time and ultimately getting a worse deal."
