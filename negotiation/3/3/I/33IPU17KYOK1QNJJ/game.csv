"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing further.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counter. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,100,000 is too far below what I can accept. Let's try this â€“ how about $1,800,000? This feels like a significant move on my end to reach a deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make a compromise, Alice, and I appreciate that. However, $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the distance we've come in our negotiation.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
