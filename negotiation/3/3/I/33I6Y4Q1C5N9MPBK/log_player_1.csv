"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer that's slightly lower than the product's true value to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I'll offer it to him for:

{""product_price"": $1,400,000}

This offer is still a good deal for Bob, but it gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is lower than the product's true value to him, but it's still a decent offer. Since I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, I'll choose to:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000 and skip the negotiation with Bob."
