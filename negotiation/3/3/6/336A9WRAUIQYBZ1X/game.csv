"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
