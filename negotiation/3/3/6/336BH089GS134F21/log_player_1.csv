Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $15,000 (Bob's maximum) might make him balk, even though he values it that highly.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This offer ensures a significant profit over selling to John for $12,000."
