"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very useful.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about selling.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone sets a positive negotiating atmosphere. 
* **Room for Compromise:** The price allows for several rounds of negotiation before reaching my minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup. If negotiations stall or Bob becomes too difficult, I can always switch to John.
* **Bob's Response:**  I'll analyze Bob's response to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more acceptable price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. I'll try to push him closer to my desired price.

**Next Move:** I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I also have limits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's midway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Positive Language:**  I use positive language (""appreciate,"" ""confident"") to keep the negotiation friendly and encouraging.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $11,000 is still well above Bob's offer but significantly closer to my desired price range. This increases the chance of a deal while still being profitable for me.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll analyze Bob's response to determine if he's getting closer to my target price or if I need to adjust my strategy. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware of John's offer as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob become unproductive, I'll consider switching to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to try to get closer to my original target. Can you consider $10,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $10,200 is still below my minimum price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's message indicates he's willing to go higher than his previous offers.  There's still room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is enticing, I'm not giving up on Bob just yet. He seems closer to my target price than he was previously.

**Next Move:**  I'll counter with a price that's slightly lower than my previous offer but still above Bob's offer. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also showing that I have limits."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  How about we split the difference again and go with $10,600?  I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10600} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly midway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates my commitment to compromise and finding a solution.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I use phrases like ""fair for both of us"" to emphasize that I'm trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $10,600 is still above Bob's offer but getting closer to my minimum price. This increases the likelihood of a deal while still being profitable for me.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I will carefully analyze Bob's response to determine his willingness to compromise and if we're getting closer to a deal.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net in case negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. Can you consider $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial financial loss. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We seem to be stuck in a stalemate.  Bob's offers are not getting closer to my desired price point.
* **John's Offer:**  At this point, I'm leaning towards selling to John.  While I'd like to get a higher price, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too great. 

**Next Move:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is slightly closer to his offer, but still significantly higher than my minimum. However, I'm prepared to move forward with selling to John if Bob continues to refuse to compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might be too far apart on price.  To make a final attempt at a deal, I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is a very fair price considering the value of this product.  If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is presented as my final offer, signaling to Bob that I'm nearing my limit.
* **Compromise & Value:** I'm lowering the price, but emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Threat of Departure:** I subtly threaten to move on to another buyer to increase pressure on Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is now my primary option if Bob rejects.
* **Bob's Response:**  This will likely determine if I finally sell to John or try to squeeze out a little more from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. Can you consider $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in round 8, with only two rounds left.  I need to make a decision quickly.
* **Unproductive Negotiation:** Bob is not budging much on his price, and we're stuck in a stalemate.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John's offer is my guaranteed profit.  There's little to gain by continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, the risk of not closing a deal with John and potentially losing out on all profits outweighs the potential gains from continued negotiations with Bob."
