Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This price is above my minimum threshold of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find the value proposition compelling, considering he values the product at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is close to my desired price and still leaves me with a profit. It's more beneficial to accept his offer than to risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
