Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I don't want to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price of $10,000. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm still not ready to sell to John just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  How about we split the difference and agree on $9,350?  It's a fair price for both of us and would get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 9350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Even though it's not my ideal price, I'm starting to run out of time and rounds. If I reject his offer, I'm not sure I can get a higher price in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to sell to John for $12,000 if I can get a deal with Bob. It's better to close the deal now."
