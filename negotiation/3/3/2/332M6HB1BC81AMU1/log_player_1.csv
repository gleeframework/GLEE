Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than his first offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I have 8 rounds left, and I want to use those to negotiate a more favorable deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm happy to negotiate,  $900,000 is still below my minimum.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this compromise?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough for me to accept. I'm determined to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, and I still have 6 rounds left. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product and our ongoing negotiations, I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. It's a fair price that reflects both of our needs. Let's close this deal now.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to go down to $1,025,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to offer $990,000, which is my final and best offer. I hope you can meet me at this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $990,000 is very close to my minimum, but I have only 4 rounds left and I'm not confident that I can push him further.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  This is the best outcome for me, as it ensures I get my minimum price."
