Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, given its value to your business. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $900000. Given the product's value to me, I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to be sure the price is right. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product will bring to your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a substantial gain for you.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000.  This price is fair and would allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $950,000 is a good deal and significantly higher than selling to John.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
