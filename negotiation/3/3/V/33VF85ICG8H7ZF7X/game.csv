"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $11,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
