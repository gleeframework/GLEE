Alice's offer is very good, but I can likely get a better price. It's worth trying to negotiate further before committing."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000.

Alice's counteroffer of $650,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can find a price closer to my target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to finalize the deal, but I'm not willing to accept $600,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll counteroffer $620,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $620,000. This is a good price for me, considering my target is to save as much money as possible. Although I could potentially keep negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly lower price.  Accepting this offer means I save $180,000 compared to buying from John."
