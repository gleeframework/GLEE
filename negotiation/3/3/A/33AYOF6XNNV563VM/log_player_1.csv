"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to close the deal in the first round, but if not, I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm going to try to push him a bit higher before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go down to $110. This is still a fair price for the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm on getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit too high. How about $108?  I'm really interested in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but $108 is still a bit too low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This is my final offer, let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price point, but I'm hoping that the pressure of potentially losing the deal to John will motivate Bob to accept my offer."
