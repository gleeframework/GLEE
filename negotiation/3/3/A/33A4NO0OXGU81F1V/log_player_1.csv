Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, you want to get as close to that price as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down slightly, you'll still earn more than your minimum.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Starting too high (e.g., $150) might discourage Bob immediately. Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale point makes it seem like you're offering him a good deal."
