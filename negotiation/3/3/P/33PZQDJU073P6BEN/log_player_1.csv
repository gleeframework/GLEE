"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong anchor price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high initial price, framing it as an investment rather than an expense. 
* **Leaving Room:** This opening offer leaves ample space for negotiation and counteroffers. By starting high, we gain a better understanding of Bob's willingness to pay and can adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate further. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is an option, but it's worth exploring if you can secure a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. Considering the exceptional nature and potential of this product, I believe its true value is closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This offer reflects a significant commitment from my side, and I'm confident it's a fair deal that benefits both of us."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We are making a significant concession of $200,000 to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, the new price of $2,100,000 is still substantially above Bob's offer and your minimum.  We want to gauge his reaction and determine if there's room to meet closer to the middle ground.
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's value and potential, reinforcing why it's worth a premium price.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit, aiming to find a win-win solution that avoids a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to come down, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, now at $1,900,000. While it's getting closer to your minimum, you're still in a position to potentially negotiate a better deal. It's worth taking a calculated risk for another round or two, but we need to be more cautious and consider moving closer to the $1,500,000 mark if Bob shows continued willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and reasonable price for a product of this caliber.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We are making a smaller concession this time, only $100,000, to signal that we're reaching our limit. 
* **Final Offer:**  Stating this is our ""final offer"" adds weight and encourages Bob to take it seriously.
* **Justification:** We keep the focus on fairness and the product's inherent value without dwelling too much on previous rounds. 
* **Decision Point:**  This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court.  He either needs to accept a price above his initial offer, or we can move on to John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. I'm willing to compromise further to reach an agreement. Please consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now at $1,850,000.  While you could likely push for a bit more, the negotiations are progressing slowly. Accepting this offer provides a significant profit above your minimum ($350,000 more than John's offer) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds. It's a strong deal at this stage of the negotiation."
