```

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.**
* **I have 9 rounds left, and John is a guaranteed buyer for $1,000,000.** 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him, aiming to get closer to my desired price.  I still have a good chance of getting a better deal with Bob, and the opportunity to sell to John is always available as a safety net."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our discussion, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer with compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows willingness to negotiate and meet him halfway.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive and respectful tone, encouraging further discussion.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a mutually beneficial solution, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while staying closer to my minimum acceptable value."

* **I have 6 rounds left, and John is a guaranteed buyer for $1,000,000.** 
* **I'm starting to see a pattern where Bob is willing to move closer to my price.**  With more negotiation, I might be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him.  I'm confident that I can get a better price with more rounds of negotiation, but if I don't, I can always sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.** I'm getting closer to my goal, but the gap is still significant.
* **I have 4 rounds left, and John is a guaranteed buyer for $1,000,000.**  I'm nearing the end of the negotiation, and there's no guarantee that Bob will come up to my price. 
* **The risk of continuing is higher than the reward.**  Selling to John now guarantees me a secure deal with a price that meets my minimum requirement.  

By selling to John, I'm ensuring a safe and profitable outcome, maximizing my gains in this scenario."
