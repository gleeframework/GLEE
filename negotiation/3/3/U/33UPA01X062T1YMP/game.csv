"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While the product seems great, I'm only able to pay $100 right now. Would you be open to that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can let it go for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is only $110.  Would you be willing to go that low?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can let it go for $125. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you!",125.0,Alice,5,
