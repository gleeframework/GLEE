"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  I think this is a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below your target price. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counteroffer at $10,200. This is as low as I can go without losing too much profit. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
