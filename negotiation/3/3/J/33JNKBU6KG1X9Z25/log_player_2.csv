"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $12,000. I think this is a great value considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is more than he's willing to pay.  It's better to see if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if he can get a lower price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  I think this is a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below your target price. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counteroffer at $10,200. This is as low as I can go without losing too much profit. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still $200 over his budget, and it's only the fifth round.  There's still room to negotiate further. It's best to see if he can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,200 is closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,800.  Let's aim for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,800 is still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $9,900. This is as low as I can go without losing too much profit. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer.  Alice has come down to $9,900, which is only $100 more than what Bob would pay John.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and the risk of breaking off negotiations and buying from John means he might end up paying the same amount.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the product."
