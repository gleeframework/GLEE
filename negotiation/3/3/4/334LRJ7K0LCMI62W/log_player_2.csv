"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to accept Alice's offer at $1,000,000.  You can get it for $800,000 from John. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option to see if you can get a better price from Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

This is the price you are willing to pay, and it's the price John is offering. This sets a clear baseline and hopefully encourages Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than her initial offer, it's still not as good as John's price.  You should continue to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get her closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

You're increasing your offer slightly from your initial counteroffer, showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product.  This compromise should encourage her to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still not as good as John's price. You've demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, so continue to see if you can get Alice closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}

You're inching closer to Alice's price, but you're still holding firm on your goal to get the best deal. This counteroffer shows a willingness to meet halfway, but you're not willing to overpay."
