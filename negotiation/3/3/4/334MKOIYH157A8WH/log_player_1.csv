"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build a positive relationship by highlighting the value of the product and framing it as a ""good deal""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I also want to see if Bob is willing to come up on his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to try and persuade him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $7,250? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise further.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept a price below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, how about $8,000? That's my absolute minimum price, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm counteroffering with my absolute minimum price of $8,000.  I'm emphasizing that it's my lowest possible price and highlighting the value of the product for Bob.  I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is the final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to the original price. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $7,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to get as close to my budget as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting increasingly difficult to get a good price from Bob. He's stubbornly sticking to his budget.  I've reached my limit and it's unlikely he'll come up further. To avoid losing more time and potentially getting a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's a safe bet that ensures I get my minimum price."
