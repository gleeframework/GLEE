Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This keeps you above your minimum of $15,000, allowing for potential concessions during negotiations. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

By starting with this offer, you create a space for negotiation while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  John is offering a significantly better price, so I'll take his offer and sell the product to him."
