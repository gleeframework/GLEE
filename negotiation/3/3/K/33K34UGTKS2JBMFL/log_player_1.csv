Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility on price.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1000000, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
