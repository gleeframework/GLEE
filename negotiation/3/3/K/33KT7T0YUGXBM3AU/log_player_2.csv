"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $9,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is quite high, especially considering she values the product at $8,000. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better price. While we could buy from John for $10,000, it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaving room for further negotiation. This approach helps us gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price and potentially reach a deal that saves us more money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but $8,500 is still closer to our upper limit than her valuation. There's room for negotiation. We'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference between our last offer ($7,000) and her current offer ($8,500). This shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has reached her minimum price, which is also a great deal for us (saving $2,000 from our maximum). There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John at a higher price."
