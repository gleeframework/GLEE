{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below my minimum ($150). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Messaging:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, aiming to create a positive response.
* **Open to Counter-Offer:** The message clearly implies I'm willing to negotiate further. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a high initial price, I aim to:

* **Test the Waters:**  See if Bob is willing to pay closer to my value.
* **Establish a Negotiation Range:**  This sets a baseline for future counteroffers.

If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:** I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I will counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still below my initial offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my value. 
* **Focus on Value:**  My counteroffer will emphasize the product's value and why it's worth more than $120.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a fair price. This can help increase his willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $140? It's still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** My message suggests I'm open to more discussion if needed.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Value:**  $140 is still above my minimum price of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Build Trust:**  By being flexible and open to compromise, I'm building trust with Bob. This could increase his willingness to agree to a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. That's the lowest I can go, but I really think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is only $25 above my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation could take time and effort without guaranteeing a better outcome. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $150, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Cut Losses:**  While I could continue negotiating, the potential gain is limited, and there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Secure Profit:**  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit with minimal effort and risk.

By choosing to sell to John, I prioritize securing a known profit over the possibility of a slightly higher price from Bob."
