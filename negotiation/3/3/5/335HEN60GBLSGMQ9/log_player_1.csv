"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product presents a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm happy to discuss it further.  To start the conversation, I'm offering it at $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Polite and Professional:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and openness to discussion. This sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Retreat:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000. This knowledge provides a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting at this stage would leave a significant portion of potential profit on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. By rejecting his offer and presenting a counteroffer, I can attempt to bridge the gap and secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  It seems we both see the value in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting a price of $1,350,000, I'm aiming for a classic negotiation tactic: meeting in the middle. This signals a willingness to compromise while still striving for a higher price.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** The message highlights the shared understanding of the product's value, reinforcing the idea that a deal in this range would be beneficial for both parties. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not significantly reducing my price. This keeps a degree of pressure on Bob to move closer to my desired outcome."
