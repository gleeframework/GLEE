"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the $700,000 offer is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the inherent value of what's being offered.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's find a middle ground.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer reflects a significant price reduction and demonstrates my desire to make this deal work.

That's a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to getting this done."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to move up on price.  To meet you halfway, let's settle on $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly discounts the true value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly reducing her price. It's clear she's aiming for a much higher price than your absolute limit. Even if she were to match your $900,000 in a later round, you know you have a guaranteed deal at $800,000 with John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate when you can save $100,000 right now."
