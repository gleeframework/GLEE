"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm really interested in this product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $800,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still giving me a significant saving.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
