"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm really interested in this product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $800,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still giving me a significant saving. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit.
