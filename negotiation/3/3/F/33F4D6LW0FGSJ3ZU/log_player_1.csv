Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer of $80 if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, accepting Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's still above my minimum price of $80 and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a sale to John at $80."
