"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes my desired price point and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob is truly interested, he'll likely counter with a lower offer.  If he rejects outright, I'll know to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $500,000 is well below my minimum acceptable value. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,800,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a significant profit margin for me.  It also leaves space for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm open to compromise, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I need to stay above my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but if he doesn't come closer to my asking price, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping my price again to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still ensuring I receive a reasonable profit.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, so I'm hoping Bob will counter with a more serious offer.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. He's not demonstrating a willingness to negotiate seriously. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not prepared to go any lower.  It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000.  This ensures I get a fair price for my product and avoids the risk of further rounds of unsuccessful negotiation."
