"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a unique opportunity for you, as it's worth significantly more to you than to anyone else.  This is my best offer, but I understand if it doesn't work for you. If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase at a lower price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
