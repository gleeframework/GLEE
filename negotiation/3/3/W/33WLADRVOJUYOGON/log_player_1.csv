Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob to make the offer more tempting.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message indicates a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if necessary. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the potential for a smooth negotiation and avoiding a situation where Bob rejects my offer entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  $11,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to maximize profit:** While $10,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin and my minimum value for the product. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can potentially push Bob higher, especially since he indicated a willingness to buy the product for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a higher price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round, I'm  keeping the negotiation alive and aiming to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However,  $10,500 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not completely giving in.
* **Re-emphasize value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him to justify the slightly higher price.
* **Positive language:** My message conveys a collaborative approach and emphasizes reaching an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but also presents a compelling reason for Bob to accept the offer."
