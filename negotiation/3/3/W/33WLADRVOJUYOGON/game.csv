"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  $11,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However,  $10,500 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
