"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $105 is still a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $100, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",100.0,Alice,5,
