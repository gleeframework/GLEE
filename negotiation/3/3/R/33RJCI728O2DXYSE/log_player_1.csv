{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000.  It's a unique item with a lot of value, and I think you'd find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum.  It leaves room for negotiation but also ensures you get a decent return.  The message is friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum of $15,000.  It's worth trying to get closer to your target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility. It also emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below your minimum of $15,000. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that further rounds will only yield small incremental increases.  John is offering your minimum price, guaranteeing you a good return, and avoiding the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in an even lower offer."
