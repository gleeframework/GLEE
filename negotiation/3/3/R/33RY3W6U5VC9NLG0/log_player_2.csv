"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to both of us. Let's make this deal happen! How about we agree on a price of $75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good start, but there's room for negotiation. We should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $75 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

We're aiming low to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves us space to increase our offer in later rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in our product. I understand your position, but I need to maintain my profit margin. I'm unable to accept $60. How about we try $65? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. We'll counter with a slightly higher offer to show flexibility but still aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  Could we meet in the middle at $62?"",
""product_price"": 62
}
``` 

We're moving closer to a price that works for both of us. This offer shows Alice we're willing to compromise but still want the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your proposal. I'm willing to consider $62, but I also have an alternative option available. Would you like to continue negotiating with me, or should I offer the product to another interested party for $80? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $62
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice is signaling she won't go lower, and even hinting at other buyers. Accepting now secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer and our initial target."
