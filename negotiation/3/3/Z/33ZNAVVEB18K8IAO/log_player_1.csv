Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is still higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but it gives him some room for negotiation and potentially finding a middle ground.  It also leaves me some buffer in case Bob counters, while still giving me a better price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counter with a lower offer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer, and hopefully, it will be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,200 is getting close to my minimum acceptable value.  It's also better than selling to John and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
