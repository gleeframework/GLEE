"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,800. Would that be feasible?",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $7,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product will bring to you.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I respect that.  $7,200 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $7,000? That's the most I can offer.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I've made some concessions, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200 was my last offer, but I'm willing to make one more slight adjustment. I'll offer it to you for $7,100. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",7100.0,Alice,7,
