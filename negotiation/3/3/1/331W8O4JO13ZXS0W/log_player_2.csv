"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by coming down from $12,000 to $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $10,500 and we know we can get the product for $10,000 from John. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
