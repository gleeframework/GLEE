"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe holds immense value for you.  I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it. This price reflects the significant benefits it will bring to your operations.  I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000.  I believe the product's value justifies a price closer to $1,100,000.  This price still offers you a strong return on your investment, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price point.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This price is fair for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
