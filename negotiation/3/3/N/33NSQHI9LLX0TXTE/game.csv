"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe holds immense value for you.  I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it. This price reflects the significant benefits it will bring to your operations.  I'm open to discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000.  I believe the product's value justifies a price closer to $1,100,000.  This price still offers you a strong return on your investment, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price point.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This price is fair for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
