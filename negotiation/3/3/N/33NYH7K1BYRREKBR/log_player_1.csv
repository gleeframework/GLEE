Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've suggested. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to your business. Let's try to bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed your proposal and while it's an improvement, I'm still not able to meet the price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's slightly below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000, it's a reasonable compromise and allows me to close the deal quickly. Continuing negotiations might risk losing Bob as a buyer and potentially necessitate selling to John, which would yield a lower profit."
