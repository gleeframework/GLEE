Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is based on the assumption that:

* **My product is worth at least $800,000 to me.** This gives me a baseline for my negotiation.
* **I don't know Bob's value for the product.** Starting high allows me to potentially extract more value if the product is highly valuable to Bob.
* **I have a backup buyer (John) at $800,000.** This gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

By starting high, I aim to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, great! If he rejects, it gives me valuable information about his perceived value of the product. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** A high starting point allows for potential concessions without compromising my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy is based on maximizing my potential earnings while still having a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Therefore, I'm not willing to accept it. 

Here's why I'm choosing to reject and proceed with a counteroffer:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob's counteroffer indicates that he is interested in the product. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoid settling for less:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss for me. I'm confident in the value of my product and am willing to invest more time in negotiations to secure a more favorable outcome.
* **Leveraging John's offer:** The knowledge that I have a backup buyer at $800,000 gives me leverage in these negotiations. I can use John's offer as a benchmark to guide my counteroffer.

By rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer, I'm aiming to find a middle ground that satisfies both parties while ensuring I receive a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer of $600,000 with a price of $900,000. This is based on the following considerations:

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $600,000. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Signaling flexibility:** By reducing my initial offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Avoiding immediate rejection:**  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable enough to avoid a quick rejection from Bob, allowing for further negotiations.

This counteroffer strategically positions me to explore further possibilities while still safeguarding my interests and maintaining a negotiating position that allows me to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still below it.  

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further lowering the price or even having him walk away entirely.
* **Guaranteed return:** Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is my minimum threshold for this product.
* **Time is valuable:**  Further negotiation with Bob might take more time, and I'd rather secure a guaranteed outcome with John.

This decision balances the potential for a slightly higher price from Bob with the certainty and speed of a sale to John.  I'm prioritizing a reliable outcome over potentially extended negotiations with Bob that might not yield a better result."
