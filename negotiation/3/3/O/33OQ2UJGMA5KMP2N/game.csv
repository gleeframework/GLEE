,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $150. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to move on.",150.0,Bob,4,
