"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $7,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to Bob ($8,000), there's still room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price through counteroffers before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $7,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $7,250. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more attractive to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,250 is a good compromise. It's lower than Bob's initial maximum price of $8,000 and still allows Bob to save money compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer is the most logical choice at this point."
