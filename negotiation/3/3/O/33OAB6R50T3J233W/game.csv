"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $7,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $7,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $7,250. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more attractive to you.",7250.0,Alice,3,
