"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that works for my budget. How about we bring it down a bit?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $725,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while being manageable for me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already gone lower than my initial offer, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
