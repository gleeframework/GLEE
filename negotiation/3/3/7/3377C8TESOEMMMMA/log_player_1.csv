Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **No Immediate Threat:** While I could mention John, I don't want to scare Bob away from negotiating. 
 
This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  Bob's reaction will reveal his level of interest and help me decide how to proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to sell the product for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While it's closer than his initial perceived value, it's still not profitable enough.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as an option keeps me in a strong negotiating position.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired price point and see if I can strike a deal more beneficial to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Closing the Gap:**  $95 is closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a Profitable Sale:** $95 is above my minimum acceptable price and gives me a decent profit.
* **Maintain Negotiation Control:** By making a counteroffer, I keep control of the negotiation and don't prematurely accept Bob's lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell the product for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Persistent Low Offer:**  Bob's offer of $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's clear he's not willing to budge much.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price and potentially ending up with a deal that's not profitable for me.
* **John's Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John at $100 guarantees me a profit, even if it's not the highest possible price.

By selling to John, I ensure a quick and profitable sale without the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
