"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while leaving a good margin for myself. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking for something within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target. I still want to keep the negotiations going to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $140? That's still a great price for the product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we possibly settle on $130? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject the offer. I want to see if I can get Bob to budge a little more. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs while offering you a great deal. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly again, but I'm also putting more pressure on Bob to close the deal. I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price and highlighting the benefits for both of us. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. Considering your costs and my budget, how about we finalize the deal at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150 and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.  I'm confident that I can make up for the difference by selling to John in the future, if needed."
