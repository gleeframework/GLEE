"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. However, $12,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than our max budget ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship but clearly states our budget limitations.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This offer will help us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she completely rejects it, we know we might need to significantly increase our offer or consider John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to your budget, $9,000 is still above what John is offering. You have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Alice we're willing to move up but also encourages her to continue negotiating down.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $7,500 puts us halfway between her last offer ($9,000) and our previous offer ($6,000).
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:** This offer still leaves some space for us to potentially negotiate a bit higher, if needed, while staying below John's $8,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reached her limit at $8,500. While this is closer to your budget, it's still more expensive than John's guaranteed offer of $8,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice since you already have a better deal from John."
