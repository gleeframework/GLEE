{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth $800,000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my original price. How about we settle at $925,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000. I'm still willing to negotiate further. I'll reject her offer and try to get a better price."
