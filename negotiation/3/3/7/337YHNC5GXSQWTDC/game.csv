"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my original price. How about we settle at $925,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $880,000 for the product. This is a very fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",880000.0,Bob,6,
