"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I think you'll find it's a fair and reasonable price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is valuable,  $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still not satisfied with the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
