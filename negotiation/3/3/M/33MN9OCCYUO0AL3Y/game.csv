"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's make this deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still stuck at my budget. I'm prepared to pay $8,750.  This is my final offer. Let me know if we can make this work.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's finalize this deal!",8875.0,Alice,5,
