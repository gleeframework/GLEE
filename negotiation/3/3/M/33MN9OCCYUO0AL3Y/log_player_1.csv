Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.

While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping for a better price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
