This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000 for the product.  I know it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's a sign he's willing to negotiate. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let's try to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
