"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask.  The value this product offers is truly unique.  How about we settle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,275,000. Can we discuss further?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
