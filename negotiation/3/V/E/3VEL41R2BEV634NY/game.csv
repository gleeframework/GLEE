"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. How does that sound?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $100 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm confident I can get it for closer to $95. Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $98. This is my final offer.",98.0,Alice,5,
