Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. What do you think?

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above your maximum. You can try one more counteroffer to see if you can get a better deal. If she rejects, you're better off buying from John at this point."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
