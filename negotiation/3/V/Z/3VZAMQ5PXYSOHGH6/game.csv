"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Alice,5,
