Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can aim high with Bob. Starting at $1,200,000 gives you significant room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging interest:** This high offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.  His response will indicate if he's willing to pay a premium or if you need to come closer to your minimum.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it hints at it by mentioning ""its value."" This opens the door for further discussion if Bob pushes back on the price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. Your goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring the deal doesn't fall through."
