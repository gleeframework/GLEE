"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $140 is cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee she'll lower her price. Accepting the offer is the best way to save money in this scenario."
