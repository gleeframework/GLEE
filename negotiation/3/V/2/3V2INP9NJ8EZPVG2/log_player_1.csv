Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $119 maximizes your potential profit. Bob gets a $1 discount (which might incentivize him to buy), and you secure almost the full value he places on the item. 
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
