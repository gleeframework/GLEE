"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $100 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering $95. This is a good compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer but still allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm also trying to emphasize the value of the product to him, hoping to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $95, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $92. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiation we've had so far. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $92 is a good price, as it's very close to my target price of $100, and I've only got 6 rounds left.  It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially with the option of selling to John for $80 always available."
