{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. There's no reason to accept it at this point.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we both see in it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal, considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $10,500 is still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $9,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is still above my budget of $8,000.  While we're getting closer, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  I can get the product for a guaranteed $8,000 from John, so it makes sense to buy from him."
