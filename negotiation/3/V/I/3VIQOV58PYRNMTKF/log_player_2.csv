"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm not sure $100 is quite right for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90? It's still a good price for you, and it would be a much better deal for me."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $95? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:** $95 is a better deal than buying from John for $120.
* **Little room for further negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the difference between $95 and his desired $90 is only $5.  It's unlikely Alice will drop her price much more.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice may be unwilling to negotiate further, and Bob would then be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 

It's a good compromise for both parties."
