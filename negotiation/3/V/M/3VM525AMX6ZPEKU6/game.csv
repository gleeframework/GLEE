"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this unique item, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reviewing my pricing strategy, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
