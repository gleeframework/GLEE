"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You can do better than $1,200,000.  While John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, there's still room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects your willingness to pay more than John's offer, demonstrating your interest in the product and making it more likely Alice will consider your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good price considering your maximum budget is $1,000,000. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially raising the price again is high.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a price that is within your budget and is a better deal than John's offer."
