,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product but my budget is a bit tighter. How about $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the value I think you'll get from the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford right now.  Let's split the difference -  $12,000.  That way we can both walk away happy.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",13500.0,Alice,5,
