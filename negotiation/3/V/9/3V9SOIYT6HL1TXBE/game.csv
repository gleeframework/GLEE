"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly unique and has the potential to be a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1200000, which reflects its exceptional value. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1050000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $950000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit below what I need to justify selling.  How about we split the difference and go with $1000000? This would give us both a good deal and ensure a successful transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $980000 still falls short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's settle on $990000. This is a fair price considering the unique value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round.",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $990000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer: $980000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",980000.0,Bob,8,
