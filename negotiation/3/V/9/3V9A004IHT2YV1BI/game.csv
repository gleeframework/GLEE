"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a competitive price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you get a valuable product at a price that's significantly lower than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement at a price that's more comfortable for me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm confident this product is worth more. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This price still gives you a significant profit margin and is fair to both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $1,025,000? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
