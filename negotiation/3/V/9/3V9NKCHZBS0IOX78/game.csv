"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and the value it will bring to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1000000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
