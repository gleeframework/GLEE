"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $18,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $19,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still well above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $17,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer in the next round.  I'm also running out of time, so I need to be careful not to risk selling to John for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16750}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,750. This is a small increase from Bob's offer but still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping this final counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to weigh my options carefully and decide whether to sell to John or risk further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum.  While I'd like to get a bit more, it's not worth risking further negotiations.  I'm happy to secure the $15,000 from John and move on."
