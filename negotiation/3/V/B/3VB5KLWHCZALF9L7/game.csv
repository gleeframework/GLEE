"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm!  However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. Let me know what you think.",9200.0,Alice,5,
