Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $12,200 is a good deal, exceeding my minimum and avoiding the risk of losing the sale entirely."
