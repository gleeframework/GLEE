"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your operations. While I can't disclose specifics due to confidentiality agreements, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000, a price that allows you significant profit and a strong return on your investment.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase at $800,000. I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:**  Alice claims she has another buyer for $800,000 (her own product's worth to her). This is likely a tactic to pressure you.
* **John is a safety net:** You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. This means Alice's offer needs to be significantly better for you to accept. 
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. She might be willing to come down to avoid losing the sale."
