"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its worth to you. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to compromise. I'll be prepared to lower my price gradually if needed.  However, if Bob rejects this offer, I will  keep the option of selling to John for $800,000 open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I can do better than $750,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I still have the option of selling to John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering a price closer to my initial offer but still below what I would ideally want. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell for his low offer. It's a strategy to hopefully meet halfway and close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I want, but it's getting closer. I'll counter again to see if we can reach a compromise. I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John, but I still believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $775,000 is still a bit low. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm slowly decreasing my price, showing flexibility. My offer is now halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000. I'll counter one more time, and if Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there!  $795,000 is still just a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm offering the minimum price I'm willing to accept, which is also the same price John is willing to pay. If Bob rejects this, I will sell to John. I hope this final offer convinces him to accept."
