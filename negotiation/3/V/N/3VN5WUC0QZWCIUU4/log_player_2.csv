"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a maximum budget of $15,000 and Alice's initial offer is $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get Alice closer to my desired price point.  A $2,000 reduction from her initial price is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still trying to save as much money as possible. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Alice has already rejected my counteroffer.  Rejecting again keeps the pressure on Alice to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but still staying below Alice's last offer. This is a good balance between pushing for a lower price and showing that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $11,200, which is only $200 more than my last counteroffer.  At this point, it's becoming increasingly likely that she won't drop the price further. Accepting the offer is the best decision. It saves me $3,800 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable compromise considering the negotiation process."
