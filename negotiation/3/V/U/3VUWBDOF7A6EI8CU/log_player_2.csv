Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is already a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $800,000 is still a bit too low for me.
