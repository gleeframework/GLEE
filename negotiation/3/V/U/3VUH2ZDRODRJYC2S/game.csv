"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That way we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's still a good price for me, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can agree on that.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's compromise at $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure about the price. How about we try $7,750 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",7750.0,Bob,6,
