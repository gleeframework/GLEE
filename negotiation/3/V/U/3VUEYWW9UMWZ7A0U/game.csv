"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",170.0,Alice,1,

"That price is a bit too high for me, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, though. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $130. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",130.0,Alice,3,

"It's closer to what I had in mind, but still a bit outside my budget. How about $100 even?",100.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go down to $100, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",125.0,Alice,5,
