{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $9,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer for $8,000, so I'm not risking losing out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum price of $8,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal with Bob, but I'm keeping my options open to sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum price and matches what I could get from John. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on the deal."
