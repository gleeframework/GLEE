"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and to kick off our conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start our negotiation, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This would be a good starting point for us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a fairer price point is $1,800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but that figure better reflects the product's worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This offer is closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential for a successful business relationship.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value.  However, I have other potential buyers, and to make this work for me, I need to be closer to $1,600,000. This offer reflects the strong demand for this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the product's value and appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 remains above my budget. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This offer is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for both of us.  ",1500000.0,Bob,6,
