"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and to kick off our conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $2,000,000 is way over his budget and he can get the same product from John for $1,000,000. It makes more sense to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start our negotiation, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This would be a good starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a fairer price point is $1,800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but that figure better reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,800,000 is a lower price than the first offer, it's still outside his budget. He can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, and continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This offer is closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential for a successful business relationship."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value.  However, I have other potential buyers, and to make this work for me, I need to be closer to $1,600,000. This offer reflects the strong demand for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's getting closer to his budget, $1,600,000 is still above what he's willing to pay. Since he can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000, it's still better to continue negotiating with Alice or simply buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I recognize the product's value and appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 remains above my budget. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This offer is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for both of us.
