"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $87.50 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $93.75? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.",93.75,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again -  let's settle on $91.50.  That's a fair price for both of us.",91.5,Alice,7,
