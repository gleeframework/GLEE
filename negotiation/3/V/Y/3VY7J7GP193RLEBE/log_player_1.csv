While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,260,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** I'm still securing a $260,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the money in hand sooner, allowing me to potentially reinvest it. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate risks creating tension and potentially losing the deal altogether."
