"Alice,  $800,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to secure a deal that aligns with my budget.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
