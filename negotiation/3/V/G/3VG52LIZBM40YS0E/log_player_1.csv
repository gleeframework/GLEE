"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  Since I have the option of selling to John for $150, I'm aiming for a price closer to that to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I want, but it's still higher than what the product is worth to him. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above what I'm willing to sell it for to John. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a good deal for him, considering he's willing to pay $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm now offering my minimum price. Since I can sell to John for this amount, there's no reason to go lower.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
