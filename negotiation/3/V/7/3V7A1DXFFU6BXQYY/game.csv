"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. I value it highly, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its true worth and the value it will bring to you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I believe the product is worth less than $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product truly is unique and its price reflects that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
