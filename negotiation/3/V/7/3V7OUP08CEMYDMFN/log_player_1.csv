Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still space to negotiate a price that's potentially more favorable for you if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  The price is still below the product's worth to Bob, making it likely he'll consider the offer. 

Remember, the goal is to find a price that both you and Bob find acceptable.  By starting with a reasonable offer, you increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly below your desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.  You have room to negotiate with Bob, as he clearly values the product more than $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to $900,000 to make this deal work for me.  This still represents a great value for you, given the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a bit more, but I'm still trying to keep costs down. I can do $875,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  You've already rejected his offer of $850,000 and made a counteroffer of $900,000, so there's a good chance further negotiation won't get you a significantly higher price. 

While you'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the most practical choice:

* **You're close to your minimum:**  $875,000 is a good return for your product.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Further negotiation might lead to Bob walking away or accepting a lower price.
* **John's offer:**  You're only $75,000 higher than what John is offering, making this a safe option.

This decision balances the need for a good price with the potential risks involved in continuing to negotiate."
