"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still within a range that might be acceptable considering its value to me. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This opening offer allows for negotiation and gives Bob room to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Option to Sell to John:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob is unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, his willingness to negotiate is encouraging. I can likely secure a higher price with further rounds of negotiation.
* **John's offer provides security:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,050,000,  which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but maintain value:**  I'm reducing my price from the initial offer but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This shows flexibility without sacrificing my profit.
* **Focus on the value proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that my price is still a good deal for him.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, inviting further negotiation and leaving the door open for a possible agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider a price of $900,000?  This is a fair price given the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While closer, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell below that.
* **John's offer is a safe option:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so I don't need to settle for a lower price with Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:**  We're making progress, and Bob seems open to negotiating. There's still a chance to reach a price we both agree on with more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my desired range. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates a genuine effort to compromise and find a middle ground. 
* **Emphasize value and fairness:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and stating that my counteroffer is a fair compromise.
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm asking Bob's opinion, keeping the lines of communication open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my target price, but $950,000 is still a bit out of reach.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John's offer is a secure alternative:**  I can secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making it less risky to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Room for a final compromise:**  With only a few rounds left, there is still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price. I can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close.  To finalize this, I'm willing to go down to $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a good deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can close this deal with this final offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer, slight compromise:**  I'm making a slight compromise by coming down from my previous offer but staying above my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates a desire to close the deal.
* **Emphasis on closing:** I'm using language like ""final offer"" and ""close this deal"" to create urgency and pressure Bob to accept.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:** I'm reminding Bob that this offer represents a good deal for both of us, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're almost there.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  This price is fair given the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. I'm hoping we can finally close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 8, and with only two rounds remaining, the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob are slim.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John's offer is a safe and lucrative option:** I can secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, which is a better deal than what Bob is currently offering.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed deal with John."
