"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,050,000,  which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider a price of $900,000?  This is a fair price given the value of the product and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my desired range. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my target price, but $950,000 is still a bit out of reach.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",925000.0,Bob,6,
