"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Buying from Alice for $11,500 is better than buying from John for $12,000. Even though you would save more money by rejecting the offer and hoping for a lower price from John, it's not guaranteed. This strategy guarantees a purchase for a lower price than your maximum limit."
