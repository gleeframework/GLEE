Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate over.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he declines, you go with your backup offer.

**Strategy**

The key is to strike a balance:

* **Too Low:** Offering a price close to $1,000,000 leaves potential profit on the table.
* **Too High:**  Getting greedy (close to $1,200,000) risks Bob rejecting the offer altogether.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Why this offer?**

* **Splits the Difference:** $1,100,000 fairly divides the potential profit margin between you and Bob.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  It allows you to secure a significant profit beyond your minimum while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Confident Language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, framing it as a worthwhile investment for Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible approach.  You could adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how confident you feel about Bob's willingness to pay."
