"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 is a good price, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10250.0,Bob,4,
