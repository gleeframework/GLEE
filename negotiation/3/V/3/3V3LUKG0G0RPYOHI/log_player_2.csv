"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $750,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. In light of that, I am willing to consider a price of $825000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair profit margin while making the product more accessible to you. I hope this proposal is acceptable.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. However, I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my absolute limit. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
