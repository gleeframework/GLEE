"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900000 is still above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $750000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. In light of that, I am willing to consider a price of $825000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair profit margin while making the product more accessible to you. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit too high for me. However, I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm prepared to offer $800000, which is my absolute limit. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
