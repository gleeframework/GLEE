"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $6,800? I think that's a fair compromise.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $6,800. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $7,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",7100.0,Alice,5,
