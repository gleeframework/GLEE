"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is capped at $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the benefits it will bring to your business.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $12000 is still outside of my budget. I'm happy to pay $9000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but $9000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product at this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
