"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, given its current market value and my needs.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.  I could consider coming down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects a more accurate valuation of its long-term benefits.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my budget constraints.  This offer is fair and allows us both to come to an agreement. ",1600000.0,Bob,4,
