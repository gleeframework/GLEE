Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, given its current market value and my needs.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my budget constraints.  This offer is fair and allows us both to come to an agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
