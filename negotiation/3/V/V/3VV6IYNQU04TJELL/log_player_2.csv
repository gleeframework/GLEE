Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $1,450,000 just yet. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we settle at $1,700,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.

It's clear Alice is not budging significantly from her initial offer. It might be a better strategy to cut our losses and buy from John at the known price of $1,500,000."
