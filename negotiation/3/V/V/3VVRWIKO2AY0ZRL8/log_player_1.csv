Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, making it potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.

**Strategy:**

* This offer allows me to test the waters with Bob while keeping a significant margin for myself. 
* I'm prepared to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target.  

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $12,000, aiming for a compromise that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a significant discount from my minimum value but still higher than Bob's offer.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or to sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is only $250 away from my minimum value of $15,000. Given the potential for further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal with Bob, and the fact that I can always sell to John for $15,000,  it makes sense to accept his offer. 

**Strategy:**

*  This offer represents a good compromise and allows me to secure a sale. 
* While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer allows me to move on and potentially avoid further negotiation with Bob.
* If I reject this offer, I risk losing Bob as a buyer, and I might not be able to get a better offer from him."
