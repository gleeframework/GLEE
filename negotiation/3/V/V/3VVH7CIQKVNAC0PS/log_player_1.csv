Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you at a price of $15,000. I believe it's worth every penny given its unique features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique features and benefits,"" I'm attempting to anchor the high price to the perceived value of the product. 
* **Alternative:** Keep in mind that I always have the option to sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not pressured to accept any lowball offers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below both my minimum ($10,000) and his own stated value ($10,000).  There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter, especially since I have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers you substantial value at $10,000, which is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to go as low as his initial offer. By calling it my ""final offer"" at this stage, I'm signaling seriousness and putting a bit of pressure on him to consider the deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm meeting him closer to the middle ground between our opening offers. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price above my minimum. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the value proposition to remind him why the product is worth a decent investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price considering what I'm looking for.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
