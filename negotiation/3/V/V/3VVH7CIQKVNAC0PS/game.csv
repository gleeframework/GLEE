"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers you substantial value at $10,000, which is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price considering what I'm looking for.  Let's make this deal happen.",10500.0,Bob,4,
