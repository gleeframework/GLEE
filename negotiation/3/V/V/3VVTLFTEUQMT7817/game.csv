"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 was a bit steep, but I was hoping you'd see the value in this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $1,550,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you can't refuse.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,680,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in making a decision.",1680000.0,Alice,5,
