{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is slightly below my minimum desired price, but it leaves room for negotiation while still potentially yielding a good profit. I want to start by offering a slightly lower price to gauge Bob's interest and potentially encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget, I am only able to offer $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000 and also below my initial offer of $11,500.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still leaves me with a reasonable profit while offering you a good price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
