{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum of $150.  This allows room for negotiation, and it's possible Bob might be willing to pay closer to my valuation. If he rejects, I can always lower the price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept $80, as it's significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
This counteroffer is still above Bob's valuation, but it's a significant step down from my original price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell for a pittance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's still a good product!  I could go up to $95.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still not an acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still interested in working with you, but $95 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a solution we both like."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but not by much.  This shows Bob I'm flexible, but still valuing the product. I'm hopeful this will be enough to close the deal without needing to sell to John."
