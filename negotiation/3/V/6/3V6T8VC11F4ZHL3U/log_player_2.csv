"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a fair price.  I'm asking for $125. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150.
* Alice is offering it for $125, which is a good deal. 
* However, you can get it for $150 from John.
* Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
