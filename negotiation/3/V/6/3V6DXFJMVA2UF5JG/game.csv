"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
