""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its unique value proposition."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob when you can secure your minimum acceptable price with John."
