"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?  This reflects the value it will bring you while acknowledging my position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $2,000,000 is still significantly higher than I'm comfortable with.  I could consider $700,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a pretty big gap between our valuations here.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she's still very far from a reasonable offer.  Her claiming ""$1,800,000 is my final offer"" is likely a negotiating tactic, and even if it's not,  it's still far above your $800,000 walk-away point. You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, which is the best choice at this point."
