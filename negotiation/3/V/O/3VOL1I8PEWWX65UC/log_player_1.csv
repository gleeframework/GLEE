Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a calculated risk. I'm offering a price 50% higher than John's offer. This is because:

* **Potential for higher profit:** If Bob values the product higher than $1,500,000, I can earn significantly more.
* **Risk assessment:** I'm willing to lose out on $500,000 if Bob rejects the offer, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 

This strategy balances the desire for maximum profit with the potential for a loss."
