"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $16,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is ridiculous, it's even higher than her perceived value of the product. John offers a much better deal.
