Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not quite there, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $112.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

While I could try to haggle Alice down a bit more, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better deal. Accepting at $112.50 gets me the product for a decent price."
