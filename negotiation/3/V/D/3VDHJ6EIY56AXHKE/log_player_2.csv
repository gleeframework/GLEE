# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my initial assessment. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  What are your thoughts?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product to your specific business model is substantial, and $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While $1,125,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value this product brings.  How about $1,180,000? This feels like a sweet spot for both of us.
