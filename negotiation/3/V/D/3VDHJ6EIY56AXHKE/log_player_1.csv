Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 3

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another option at $1,150,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is signaling that he has another option and his latest offer is getting close to our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk he'll walk away.  Accepting at $1,150,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the potential loss of the deal entirely."
