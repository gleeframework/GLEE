{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling below your minimum value of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You've left a significant margin for Bob to counteroffer, potentially reaching a price closer to his valuation of $1,000,000.
* **It's reasonable:**  While you're asking for a high price, it's not unreasonable given the value to Bob. 

Remember, you can always adjust this initial offer based on Bob's response and your own risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum value of $800,000, it's significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for profit. It's worth trying to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob that's slightly higher than his offer but still below your initial offer. This will show him that you're willing to negotiate but also want to maximize your profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer finds a middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Still Profitable:**  $900,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Signal:** This counteroffer shows Bob that you are willing to negotiate but also that you believe the product is worth more than his offer.

Remember, you can always adjust this offer based on Bob's response and your own risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your initial offer, it's still lower than the $900,000 you're hoping for.  There's still room to negotiate and push for a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

It's a good idea to make another counteroffer to Bob. You can use this counteroffer to see if you can close the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer, potentially settling at a price closer to $900,000.  

Remember to be strategic and keep your goal of maximizing profit in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $887,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 887500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Small Increment:**  By offering a price just slightly higher than Bob's last offer, you are signaling that you are close to accepting but still want to maximize your profit.
* **Finality:** The message suggests that this might be your final offer, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Consider John's offer:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, you should seriously consider selling the product to John for $800,000. This is a safe option that guarantees a minimum profit.
* **Evaluate Risk Tolerance:** Weigh the potential for a higher price from Bob against the risk of continuing the negotiations and potentially getting a lower price or no deal at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still trying to save some money. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is only $7,500 lower than your last offer of $887,500.  While it's not your ideal price, it's a very good deal considering you're already close to your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  

**Considerations:**

* **Time:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing time, potentially impacting your ability to sell to another buyer later.
* **Risk:**  There's a chance that Bob might not budge further, and you could end up selling to John for a lower price.

**Conclusion:**

It's best to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal. You'll be able to secure a good profit, avoid further negotiation, and ensure a sale."
