"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I need to make a profit. My initial offer is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's well above her minimum acceptable price, and there's room for negotiation.  It's better to reject and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still above my target price.  I'm still willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise.  This is a good deal for both of us, let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I think we can do better than that. My counteroffer is $1,250,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm not willing to pay more than $1,200,000 at this point, and I'm confident we can reach a better deal with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer.  I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a bit more profit. My counteroffer is $1,225,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,225,000 which is just slightly higher than my maximum price of $1,200,000.  At this point, I'm willing to accept and close the deal rather than risking another rejection and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's still a good deal for me as I'm saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
