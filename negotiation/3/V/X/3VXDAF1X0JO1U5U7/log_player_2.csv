"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price for a product of this value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's desired price range. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate further. There's still room for both parties to find a middle ground."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me at a higher price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. Although it's lower than Alice's initial offer, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the product altogether. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring a purchase within his budget."
