"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However,  $12,000 is considerably below its true value.  Could we agree on $13,500? It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I want to find a solution that works for us both. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,125? This reflects a willingness to compromise from both sides.",13125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $13,125 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to consider $12,900? I feel that's a fair offer, and I'm eager to close this deal.",12900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you've been great to negotiate with and I respect your approach.  Let's make this final offer, $13,000 and we can both walk away happy. This product will really serve you well, I'm sure of it.",13000.0,Alice,7,
