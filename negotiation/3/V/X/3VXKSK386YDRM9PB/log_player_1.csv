Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think you'll be very satisfied with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to go lower.  Offering it to Bob at this price maximizes your potential profit.
* **First Refusal Strategy:** By phrasing it as a ""special price"" and offering it to Bob first, you create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially increasing his willingness to pay the full price."
