"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $9,500 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750? That's a good compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I was thinking we could meet at $9,200. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for a high-quality product like this. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,200 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price that's a bit lower. I'm confident we can close this deal if you come down to $8,900. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,900, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $9,050? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",9050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm very close to closing this deal, but $9,050 is still a little too high for me.  If you could come down to $8,800, we can finalize this transaction.  This would be a good price for both of us, and it would be a fair compromise.",8800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, but I'd like to propose a small increase to $9,050 is too high, so how about we meet at $8,950? It's a small increase from $8,800, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",8950.0,Alice,9,
