{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget.** While it's tempting to accept, you're aiming to save money.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.** You're aiming for a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but you want to be realistic. $8,500 is a reasonable starting point.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,200 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price that's a bit lower.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,900, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $9,050? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm very close to closing this deal, but $9,050 is still a little too high for me.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to the limit, Bob.
