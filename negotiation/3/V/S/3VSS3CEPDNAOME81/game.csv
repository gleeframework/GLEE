"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $9,500. What are your thoughts?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,200?  This is a fair price that's close to your minimum and within my budget.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,350. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",8350.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're close to your minimum price, but I'm still stuck at my maximum. I'm willing to go up to $8,100.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal.  Let's close this out.",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $8,100 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,150. This is the closest I can get to my minimum price without giving away too much value. What do you think?",8150.0,Alice,7,
