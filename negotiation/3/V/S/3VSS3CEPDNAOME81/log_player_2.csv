"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $9,500. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's best to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target of $8,000.  There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,200?  This is a fair price that's close to your minimum and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,350. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target of $8,000. There's only a small difference, but Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you're close to your minimum price, but I'm still stuck at my maximum. I'm willing to go up to $8,100.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal.  Let's close this out."", ""product_price"": 8100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $8,100 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,150. This is the closest I can get to my minimum price without giving away too much value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,150 is still above Bob's target price of $8,000. While there is only a small difference, Bob has already made multiple counteroffers and Alice is clearly reluctant to go lower.  Given the limited rounds remaining, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
