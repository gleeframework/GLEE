"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can consider it.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
