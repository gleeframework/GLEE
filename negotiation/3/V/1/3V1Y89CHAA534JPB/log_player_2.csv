# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is tempting, you can do better. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $15,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or find a better deal elsewhere."
