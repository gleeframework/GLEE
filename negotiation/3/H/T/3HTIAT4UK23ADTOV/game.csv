,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1200000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop the price to $1300000. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1300000. Would you consider $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is still too low for me. How about we settle on $1275000? It's closer to your offer, and we can both come to an agreement. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1275000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1260000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you consider meeting me at this price?",1260000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1260000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's find a happy middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1265000.  This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. What do you think?",1265000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1260000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1245000? I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value of the product to me.",1245000.0,Bob,8,
