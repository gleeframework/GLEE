Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount to you, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that should be more in line with your budget, while still allowing me to earn a substantial profit.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is your absolute limit, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is still a discount from the original price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice is stuck at $1,200,000 and unwilling to budge. It's clear she won't go down to a price that makes sense for you. It's better to cut your losses and go with John, even though it's a higher price, than to waste more time negotiating with Alice."
