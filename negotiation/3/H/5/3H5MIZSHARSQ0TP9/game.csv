"Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with this unique product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, your offer is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To be realistic, the product's value is much closer to my original asking price. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $900,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $975,000. This is my final offer for now.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $975,000 is still significantly below the product's true value.  Frankly, I'm prepared to walk away and pursue other options if we can't agree on a price closer to $1,100,000. To demonstrate my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to accept $1,075,000. This offer stands until the end of the next round.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,075,000, which would be $1,025,000. However, I'd like to propose a slight discount for a quick sale. How about we do $1,000,000 for a prompt payment?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
