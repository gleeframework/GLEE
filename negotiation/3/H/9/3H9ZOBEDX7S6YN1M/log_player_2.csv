"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm happy to buy it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer to see how far Alice is willing to come down. This price is still significantly more valuable to Alice than her alternative, and it gives her some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,000? This gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's still a significant saving for Bob compared to buying from John, and it's likely the best deal Bob is going to get from Alice. It's also closer to Bob's desired price of $8,500.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a failed deal."
