,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? It's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget better.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",108.0,Bob,4,
