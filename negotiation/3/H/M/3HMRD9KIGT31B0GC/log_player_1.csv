{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable at this price, as it's still significantly less than what he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more to you!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still lower than $150. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price. John's offer of $150 is guaranteed and meets my minimum requirement. Therefore, I'll sell the product to John."
