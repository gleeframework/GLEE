This offer starts at a high price point, but is still lower than your minimum acceptable value. This allows for some room for negotiation while still giving you a good profit."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  It's worth more than $8,000 to me, and I can get $10,000 from John. I'll counter offer to try to get closer to my desired price."
