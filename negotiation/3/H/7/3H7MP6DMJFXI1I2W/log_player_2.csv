"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a special price of $9,000. This is a one-time opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is looking to buy the product for less than $10,000. Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's target price.  Since Bob has a fallback option of buying from John for $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer keeps his options open.  He can try to negotiate with Alice further or simply go with John's offer."
