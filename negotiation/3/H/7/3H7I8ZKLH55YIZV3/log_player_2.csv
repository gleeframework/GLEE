Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $14000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15500 is the lowest I can go.  This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
