"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $17000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $14000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's a chance he might increase his offer.  Additionally, selling to John guarantees me $15,000, so it's a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,500 is the lowest I can go.  This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still interested in the product, but $15500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $15250?  That's the absolute most I can afford, and it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's only a small amount lower than my last counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by being too stubborn. Additionally, it's only $250 less than what I could get from John, so it's a worthwhile compromise to secure a sale now."
