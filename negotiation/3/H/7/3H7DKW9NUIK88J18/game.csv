"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to pay $105, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $112.50?",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're asking for $112.50, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go for $108.75?",108.75,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go quite that low. I can meet you at $112.00, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
