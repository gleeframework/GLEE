"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. To be honest, I'm only willing to pay up to $1000000 for this product. If we can reach an agreement at that price, I'd be happy to move forward. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1500000. This price reflects the value of the product while still being reasonable.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
