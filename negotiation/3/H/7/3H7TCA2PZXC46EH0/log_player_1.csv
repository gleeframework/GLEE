{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to your business.  My initial price is $1,800,000. This is a fair starting point, but I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. To be honest, I'm only willing to pay up to $1000000 for this product. If we can reach an agreement at that price, I'd be happy to move forward.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still being reasonable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has finally offered my minimum price, so I will accept his offer. This ensures I meet my minimum profit goal and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
