Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting offer that is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. It allows for negotiation space and leaves the door open for a counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $65 is above Bob's perceived value, it is significantly below my minimum value of $120.  It's important to try and find a middle ground that benefits both of us.  I will counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
