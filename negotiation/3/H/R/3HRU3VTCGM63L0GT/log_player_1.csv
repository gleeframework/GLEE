**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is clearly trying to nickel-and-dime the price lower and lower. While $990,000 is a significant sum, we're still losing $210,000 from our guaranteed sale with John. Bob's incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to move much higher. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
