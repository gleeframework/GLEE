Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum price of $80, aiming for a good profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  You're leaving room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation for both of you. 
* **It's a fair initial offer:** $120 is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and start the negotiation process. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110?  This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we settle at $105? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$105 is a good compromise. It's higher than selling to John, and while it's still lower than my initial goal, it's close enough that it's likely not worth risking further negotiation."
