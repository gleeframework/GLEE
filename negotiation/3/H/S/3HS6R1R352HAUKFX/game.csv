"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to come down to $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90. How about $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $98. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle again and go with $99?",99.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  I'm really interested in the product, but $99 is still too close to your original offer. Would you be willing to come down to $96? This is my final offer.",96.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $98. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but that's as low as I can go. How about we meet in the middle again and go with $99.5?",99.5,Alice,7,
