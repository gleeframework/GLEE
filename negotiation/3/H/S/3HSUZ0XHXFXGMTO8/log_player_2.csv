"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $140. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to you ($150). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $135? I think it's a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is still within my budget and closer to my ideal price. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a lower price and potentially having Alice walk away."
