"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living, you know. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $1,000,000 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $900,000? It's still a great price for you, and it's a compromise for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $700,000? That's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
