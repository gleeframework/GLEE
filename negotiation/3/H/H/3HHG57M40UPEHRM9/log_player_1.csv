Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and more likely to consider my offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to increase his perceived worth and make him more willing to pay a higher price.

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while maintaining a good starting point. If Bob rejects, I can lower my price slightly in the counter-offers, but I'll always have John as a backup buyer to ensure I get at least my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a step in the right direction, $9,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for higher offers:** There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price.
* **John is a backup:** If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my desired price.

This strategy keeps the negotiation open, aiming for a higher price while maintaining a safety net in case of failure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500?  This price still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing willingness to negotiate, but I'm not going too far down.
* **Mid-ground price:** $10,500 is a midpoint between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). It's a reasonable compromise that still keeps me closer to my desired price.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing that the proposed price allows both of us to gain something from the deal, making it more appealing for Bob. 

This counteroffer shows I'm flexible but still committed to getting a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the bottom:** While Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation could lead to a higher price, but it could also drag on and waste valuable time. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price of $15,000. This ensures I get the best possible outcome and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation with Bob.

By selling to John, I maximize my profit and minimize the risk of not achieving my desired outcome."
