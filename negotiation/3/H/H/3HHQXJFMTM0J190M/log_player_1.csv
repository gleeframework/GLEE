Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting Bob to buy it allows us to maximize our profit.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our $15,000 goal.
* **High but reasonable:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but not unreasonably so. It creates an opportunity for us to highlight the product's benefits and potentially persuade Bob of its higher value. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have some time and flexibility. If we need to sell the product quickly, a price closer to $15,000 might be more strategic to ensure a sale."
