"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. Would you consider $10,500? This is still a great deal for a product worth much more.  Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $9,750 is still a bit too low.  How about $10,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale.  What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
