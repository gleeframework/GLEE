"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product at a special price of $11,000. I think you'll find it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than what Bob is willing to pay ($12,000). 
* This means Bob saves $1,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* While he could get the product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to do so when a better deal is available."
