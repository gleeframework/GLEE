{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already getting more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still $1,000 of potential profit for Bob, which incentivizes him to accept or counteroffer.
* **It shows you're serious:** A high initial offer demonstrates that you're not desperate to sell immediately.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to try to save a bit more. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is above your minimum, it's significantly lower than what you initially offered and still leaves you with room for a better deal. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:** It shows you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Potentially secure a higher price:**  You can counteroffer and try to close the gap.
* **Avoid settling for less:** You can explore if Bob is truly willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still give you a good price and allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($11,000), showing you're willing to be flexible.
* **Reasoning and Justification:** The message highlights the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing that he would still get a good price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** It's still above your minimum of $12,000, keeping you in a strong negotiating position.

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer or makes another counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $12,000? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer is at your minimum price. While it's tempting to keep negotiating,  here's why selling to John is the best option:

* **No further upside:**  You've reached your minimum. Further negotiations won't increase your profit.
* **Certainty and Time:** John is a guaranteed buyer, eliminating the risk of further rejections and negotiations.
* **Potential for Delays:** Bob's budget limitations suggest potential for drawn-out negotiations, potentially costing you time.

Selling to John ensures a quick and certain transaction at your minimum price, leaving you free to explore other opportunities."
