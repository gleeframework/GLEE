"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your budgetary concerns. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still far outside my budget.  To be honest, I'm considering other options that are closer to the $700,000 range. If you can make a more realistic offer, I'm still interested. Otherwise, I might need to explore those alternatives.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some urgency on your end and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm confident this product is worth well over your initial offers, I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value you'll gain from it. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that might work. However, $1,000,000 is still a stretch for me.  I could make this work at $800,000. That's the absolute top of my budget, and I wouldn't be able to go any higher. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
