"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice first. $140 is close to my limit, but there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her value. This gives me room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Open:** My message is friendly and expresses interest while still making it clear I'm looking for a lower price. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My goal is to get the price as close to $110 as possible, as this represents significant savings for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my desired range, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get the price down closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That seems like a fair price."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  Alice countered with $130, which is halfway between our previous offers. Meeting her at $120 continues this pattern and feels like a natural compromise point.
* **Targeting Her Value:**  This offer is exactly at Alice's value for the product. While she'd ideally like to make a profit, she might accept to avoid losing the sale entirely.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Alice might reject this offer, and I'd have to go higher or go with John. However, the potential savings of $10-30 make it worth the risk."
