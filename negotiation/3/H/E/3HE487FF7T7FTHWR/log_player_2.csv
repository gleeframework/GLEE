"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer. We want to see if we can negotiate a lower price. There's no information yet on how much Alice values the product, so there's potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price is a good strategy. It signals our willingness to negotiate and establishes a lower starting point. This also gives us room to maneuver in subsequent rounds if Alice counter-offers.  $7000 is a significant discount, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit if her value for the product is lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to our desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows us to continue exploring a lower price, potentially getting closer to our target of $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're incrementally increasing our offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's current offer.  $8,000 is a good middle ground that keeps the negotiation moving forward."
