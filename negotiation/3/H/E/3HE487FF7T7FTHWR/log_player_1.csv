"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate downward if necessary. It's also a price that reflects the product's worth to me, while still allowing for a possible profit.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,000 is below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $9,000.  This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, while being closer to Bob's offer.  I believe this is a fair price that might convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I would prefer to get a little more, Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum threshold. It's also the same price John is offering.  I don't want to risk losing a sale and having to start over with a new buyer. Accepting Bob's offer is the best way to guarantee I make my minimum."
