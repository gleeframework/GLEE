"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe is of significant value to you, just as it is to me. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000, which reflects its true worth. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something that aligns perfectly with your needs.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it at the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to save money and Alice's offer is exactly at your maximum price.  You can buy the product from John for the same price, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to maintain the possibility of a better deal in the future, or to use the time to evaluate if the product is truly worth $1,000,000 to you."
