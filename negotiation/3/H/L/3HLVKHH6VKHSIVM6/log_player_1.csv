{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $130 is still below my minimum threshold of $150, and I believe I can get closer to my goal price in the next few rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still above my minimum. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}

While $135 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  I've reached the point where the negotiations with Bob are becoming tedious and I'm not likely to get a much better price.  John's offer is a secure deal that meets my minimum requirement, so I'll take it."
