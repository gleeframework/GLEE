"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at over $1 million, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
