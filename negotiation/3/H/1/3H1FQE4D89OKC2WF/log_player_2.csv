"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. I believe you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's first offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  We should aim lower and see if she's willing to come down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

While Alice is moving closer to our desired price, we haven't reached a point where accepting is the best option. There's still room to negotiate for a better deal before considering John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $675,000 is a good compromise for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised by moving from $800,000 to $750,000, and I'm not willing to give up much more. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a new offer of $725,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and we're getting close to a price that's significantly lower than John's offer. Accepting at $725,000 secures a good deal without risking the negotiation falling apart."
