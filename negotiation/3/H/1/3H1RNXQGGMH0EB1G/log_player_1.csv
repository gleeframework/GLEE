Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is quite significant, and $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Could we perhaps meet in the middle, say around $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're getting closer. To be honest, $9,500 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? This ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}"

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be respectful of your budget. However, I can't go as low as $9,000. My final offer is $10,000.  Take it or leave it."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to go above $8,500.  While we have rounds to spare, it's risky to continue negotiating and potentially end up with a worse offer.  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees a decent profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
