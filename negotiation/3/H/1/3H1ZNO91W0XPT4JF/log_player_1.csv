Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, she should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Appeal to Bob's Interest:** The message highlights the product's benefit to Bob and frames the offer as exclusive, potentially making him more inclined to accept.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
