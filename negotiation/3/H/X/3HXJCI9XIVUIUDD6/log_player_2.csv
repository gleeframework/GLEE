"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You can save $300,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate.  There's still room for a better price, and you have a backup option (John) if the negotiation fails."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you'd like to pay.  You're better off rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price.  The closer you can get to $800,000, the more you save. You also have the option to buy from John as a safety net."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is not budging much, and her offer is getting closer to what you'd pay John.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate and getting a worse offer from Alice outweighs the potential of saving a few more thousand dollars. Buying from John guarantees you get the product for a price you're comfortable with."
