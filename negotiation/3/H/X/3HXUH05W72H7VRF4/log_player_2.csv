"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's more than double what the product is worth to Bob.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the maximum value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly higher than Bob's maximum value of $8,000.  There's still room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject and try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to go up to $9,000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. It's a bit higher than your maximum, but I'm willing to compromise to find a deal. Let's see if we can shake hands on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still over Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. There are only five rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too much for me. I'm firm on my offer of $9,000. It's a fair price considering both our needs. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at $11,000. Let's try to find a deal 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. With only three rounds remaining, the risk of not being able to negotiate a lower price is high.  It's more prudent to secure the product from John for the guaranteed price of $8,000."
