"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, but also signals that I believe the product has significant value.  I'll need to assess Bob's response to see how much he values the product and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. While I could take the $8,000, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000, my absolute minimum. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but won't go any lower. I'm hoping that he'll realize my value and either accept this price or come back with a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good enough price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping for a better offer. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $11,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway. However, it's still above my minimum, so I'm not giving away too much. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept or at least come back with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, we're running out of time. I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to him rejecting all my counteroffers. At this point, it's more secure to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
