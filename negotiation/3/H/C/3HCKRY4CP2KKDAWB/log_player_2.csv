# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

This is a good deal for Bob. He's getting the product for $375,000 less than his maximum budget and Alice is getting a fair price above her minimum.  Pushing further might annoy Alice and risk the deal."
