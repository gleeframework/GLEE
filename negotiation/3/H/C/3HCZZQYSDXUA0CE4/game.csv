"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your feedback. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  Could you consider $1,300,000? I believe this price reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
