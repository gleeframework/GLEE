"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $150. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. This is still a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $150. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to me. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making concessions, she's unlikely to go below $90, and her final offer of $100 is still above your maximum budget.  John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which meets your needs and avoids further negotiation."
