# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering Alice.  $110 is still above your maximum price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $108. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:

You are still willing to pay less than $108.  Let's see if we can negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $108 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $107.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 107}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $107 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $109. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $109 is closer to your maximum price point, it's still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
