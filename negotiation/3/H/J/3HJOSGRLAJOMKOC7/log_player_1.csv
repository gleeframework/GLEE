Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is more than your minimum asking price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for him to counter and for you to meet in the middle.
* **It shows you're serious:** You're not starting at the highest possible price, but you're not undervaluing the product either. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. Good luck with the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I really like the product, but I have to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and the value the product holds for Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Negotiate further:** You can try to get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer.
* **See if Bob is truly serious:** If he's willing to walk away, it might indicate that he's not as invested in the product as you thought.

**Next Step:**

You'll need to craft a counteroffer to Bob. Remember to consider the following:

* **How much are you willing to lower your price?**
* **What's the highest price Bob is likely to accept?**
* **How important is it to close the deal with Bob?**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I can't go down to $1,250,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* **Reasonable price:** $1,350,000 is still a good profit for you while leaving some room for Bob to potentially counter.
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll get.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response.** If he rejects, you'll have to decide if you want to make another counteroffer or move on.
* **Evaluate your options.** If Bob doesn't accept your counteroffer, you need to decide if you're willing to lower your price further or if you should consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:** $1,300,000 is very close to your desired price of $1,400,000 and significantly higher than the price John would offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob says it's his final offer, there's always a chance you could negotiate a bit higher in future rounds.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will come back with a higher counteroffer. You could end up selling to John for a much lower price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a good deal and avoid the risk of a lower sale."
