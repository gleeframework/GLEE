"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is significantly more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $850000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my initial offer was already a compromise, considering the product's true value to me is $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a compromise that benefits both parties.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to continue the negotiation. However, I'm not willing to go below $1050000, as I need to make a profit. Considering your last offer was $900000, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'll add a small buffer. I'm counteroffering at $975000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to accept, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $975000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $925000.  I think this is a fair compromise given our previous offers, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to make a profit, and $925000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,7,
