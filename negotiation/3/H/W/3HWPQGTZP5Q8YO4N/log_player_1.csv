"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the interest, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $150 for the item. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

```

While I aimed for a higher price, Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing the opportunity for a slightly higher offer."
