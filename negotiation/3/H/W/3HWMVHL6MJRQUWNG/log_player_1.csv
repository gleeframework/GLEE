{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, making it more appealing. I can adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a slightly higher price,  $9,750 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum of $8,000 and significantly closer to my ideal price.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether and having to settle with John for a lower price."
