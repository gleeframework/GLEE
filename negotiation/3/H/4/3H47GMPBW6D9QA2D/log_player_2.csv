"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $120 is above Bob's maximum price of $150. 
*  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his maximum price of $150 as possible.
* Offering $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* This counteroffer gives Alice room to counter, but still leaves some wiggle room for Bob to potentially lower the price further in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.
* Alice's counteroffer of $110 is still above Bob's target price of $100.
* While $110 is closer to Bob's target than Alice's initial offer, rejecting and counteroffering again allows for further negotiation.
* There are still 7 rounds remaining to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob continues to push for a lower price.
* Offering $105 is a compromise that shows Bob is willing to meet halfway.
* This offer is still below Alice's latest counteroffer, while also being a reasonable increment from Bob's previous offer.
* This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and increases the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price."
