"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John. It makes sense to counteroffer Alice first, as he might be able to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $13000?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price for the value the product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is better than $18,000, it is still higher than his budget.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice further."
