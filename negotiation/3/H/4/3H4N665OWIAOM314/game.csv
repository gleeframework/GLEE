"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $13000?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price for the value the product offers.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8000. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer. ",8000.0,Bob,4,
