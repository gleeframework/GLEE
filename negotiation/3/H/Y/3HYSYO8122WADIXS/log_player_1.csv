Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make him more receptive to a price that's still very favorable to you. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price above his perceived value but still below your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth, even if he doesn't value it as highly as you do.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000, so you can afford to be firm in your negotiations with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher.
* **Relationship Importance:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly less aggressive opening might be preferable."
