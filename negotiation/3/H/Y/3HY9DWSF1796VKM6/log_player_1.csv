Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe it will make a real difference in your endeavors. I'm willing to part with it for $1,900,000. This is a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** By emphasizing the product's worth to Bob and highlighting its ""unique"" nature, you aim to justify a price well above his perceived value.
* **Negotiation Room:** This initial high price leaves room for negotiation. Even if Bob counters, you're likely to settle for an amount significantly higher than $1,000,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob perceives the product as highly valuable and potentially has a strong need for it."
