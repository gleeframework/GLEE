Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would bring you significant value, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John. Therefore, it makes sense to start negotiations higher than both values.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $18,000 offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping Alice comfortably above her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** By framing the offer as beneficial to Bob and mentioning a public listing (which would likely increase competition), Alice adds a sense of urgency and value proposition.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's essential to gauge Bob's personality and negotiation style. If he's known to be extremely price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective."
