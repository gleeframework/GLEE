"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still below the value to John. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows room for concessions while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum.  I'm trying to find a compromise point that's attractive to Bob but also allows me to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum and  higher than what I think I can get in future rounds. I'm accepting his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a good deal."
