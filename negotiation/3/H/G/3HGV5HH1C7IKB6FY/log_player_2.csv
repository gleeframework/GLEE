"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price, but it's within the range of your budget. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating, so it makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while still being a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than what you'd like to pay, but it's closer to your ideal price. It's also considerably lower than buying from John at $1,500,000.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to minimize your costs."
