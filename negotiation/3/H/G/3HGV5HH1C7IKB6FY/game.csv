"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while still being a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
