"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I'm confident in the product's worth and believe a price closer to my initial offer is more fitting. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position,  the value of this product is significant.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,5,
