* Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000. 
* Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* It leaves room for potential compromise while still ensuring a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer and the price from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer is $9,200, which is closer to her initial offer of $9,000, and closer to the price from John ($10,000). 
* It's still within your budget, but you can potentially get a better price.
* Rejecting the offer allows for another round of negotiation, potentially leading to a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You know Alice is willing to sell for less than $9,000. 
* Your previous offer of $8,500 was rejected, so you need to increase it slightly. 
* Offering $8,750 is a compromise, closer to Alice's price point while still saving money compared to her last offer and John's price. 
* This allows for potential agreement while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer to her original price point, and further from your desired price.  
* It's increasingly unlikely that you'll be able to negotiate a significantly lower price with Alice.
* John's offer of $10,000 is your upper limit.
* Buying from John guarantees you get the product within your budget while minimizing the risk of further negotiation leading to a higher price."
