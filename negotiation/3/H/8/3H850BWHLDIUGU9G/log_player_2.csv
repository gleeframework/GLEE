"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I think it provides significant value, especially considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will either reject further offers or simply walk away from the deal. 
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting the offer saves Bob time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation.

Overall, accepting the $13,000 offer is the most sensible choice for Bob at this point."
