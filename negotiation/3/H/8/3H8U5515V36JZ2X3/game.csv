"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair offer. How about we discuss a price that is beneficial for both of us? Would you consider $120 for this product?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value of the product and my position, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. This allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction. I hope this proposal works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $80, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me propose a price of $90 for the product. This is a step towards meeting your expectations while also considering the value of the product to me. I hope this proposal is more agreeable.",90.0,Alice,5,
