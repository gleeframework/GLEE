"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. However, $1,100,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000.  This reflects a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your budget. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum. I'm offering $1,200,000, which is the value you recognize in the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
