"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we both get a fair price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $87?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
