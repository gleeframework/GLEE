"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts by being friendly and highlighting the value of the product.  It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($150) but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $50. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $50 is unfortunately way below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for you. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $50 was a low offer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $65?  That's a fair price, and I'm eager to get my hands on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $65 is a slight improvement over Bob's previous offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell the product for such a low price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $65 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's reach an agreement so you can enjoy the product!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I can do $70, but that's my absolute limit.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $70 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm running out of time and I'm not willing to risk a deal falling through.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I get a fair price."
