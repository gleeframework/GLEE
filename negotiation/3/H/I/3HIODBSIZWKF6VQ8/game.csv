"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $10000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $14000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's rarity and the value it can bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident that this product is worth a lot to me, but I can't go above $11000. Let's try to meet in the middle on this.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $13000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $12800. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12800 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $11500, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point.",11500.0,Bob,6,

Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $12900. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay above $12900.",12900.0,Alice,7,
