"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,350,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product. I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I need to get closer to my target. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
