"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $850000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $880000? That's the best I can do at this point.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you really want this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $920000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go as low as $890000. That's the best I can do. Can you consider that?",890000.0,Bob,6,
