Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value.

I will reject Bob's offer. While it matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation to secure a higher price."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  We're making progress, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price than $1,350,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $1,400,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer. While I could push for more, we're getting close to the point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting $1,300,000 provides a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the potential loss of losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
