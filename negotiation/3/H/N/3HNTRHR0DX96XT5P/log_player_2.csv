"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,001. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,200,001 is below your maximum budget, it's very close to her own valuation. There's a good chance you could get a better price by rejecting this offer.  You're willing to go up to $1,500,000 and John is a guaranteed backup at that price."
