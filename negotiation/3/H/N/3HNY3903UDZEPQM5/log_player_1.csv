"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but if not, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise,  but still significantly more than what Bob offered. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to what I want, but I still believe I can get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and see if he'll come up in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will be the sweet spot and Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,500 is tempting, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with John.  I'll take a chance and reject this offer, hoping Bob will come up just a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16800}
```

This is a small compromise from my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle, especially since we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation. If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,700 is very close to my counteroffer, and with only two rounds left, I don't think I can get much more.  It's better than John's offer of $15,000, so I'll accept it."
