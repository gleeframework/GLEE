"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $11,500?  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250 as a compromise.
