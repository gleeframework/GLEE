"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about $90? It's a fair compromise that would give us both a good deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $80. How about $82.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90.",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $82.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about $87.50? That's closer to your offer and allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above $80, and I'm not comfortable with $87.50. How about $85? That's the middle ground between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $88? This would be a fair compromise and would help us close the deal. What do you think?",88.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go any higher than $85, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $88, so how about $84? That's the best I can do.",84.0,Bob,8,
