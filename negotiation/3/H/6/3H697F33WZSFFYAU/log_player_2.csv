"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's too high, and he can likely get a better price.  He has plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob is going to start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will put some pressure on her to negotiate and hopefully start the process of finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum. He can try to negotiate further.  There's still time and room to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob is going to increase his offer slightly, showing Alice he's serious about buying but still trying to get a lower price. He's aiming for a compromise and getting closer to his goal of $9000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still determined to save money.  While $10,500 is within his budget, he can still try to get a better deal. There are enough rounds left to negotiate and he's getting closer to his goal.  He can risk one more round to try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is going to make his final counteroffer. He's willing to pay Alice's minimum, but only because he's close to running out of rounds. He's hoping she accepts, but if she doesn't, he'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has reached a point where the negotiation is getting very tight. While he can try to negotiate further with Alice, the risk is that Alice will keep rejecting his offers, and he'll run out of rounds. At this point, it's better to secure the product from John at $10,000. He's achieved a pretty good deal, and he's minimizing the risk of losing out on the product altogether."
