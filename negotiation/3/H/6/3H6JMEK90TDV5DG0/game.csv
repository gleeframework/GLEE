"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $120 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $105 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you $115, which is the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
