"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a strong offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price for the value you're providing.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",925000.0,Alice,5,
