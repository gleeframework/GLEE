Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price attractive enough for Bob to accept while maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to start higher. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **High Starting Point:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation but aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""fair deal"" and ""significant benefits,"" you provide a rationale for the price without revealing your minimum.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You gain a $100,000 profit over your guaranteed sale.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might counter-offer. You have room to negotiate down towards $1,250,000, still making a profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** You proceed to sell to John at your guaranteed price.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no time constraints. In a time-sensitive situation, you might adjust your approach to ensure a quicker sale."
