"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks Alice for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. Considering the value to me, I'd be interested in paying $9,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $9,500 and I think that's a fair price considering our back-and-forth. Let's finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
