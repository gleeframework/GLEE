"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $145 is within your budget, you can likely get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, or you can buy from John for $150."
