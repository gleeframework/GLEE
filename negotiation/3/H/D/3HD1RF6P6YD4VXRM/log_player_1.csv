"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  I can offer you $130.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum of $150, $130 is a good price and I'm concerned that if I continue to negotiate, I might lose the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a profit now than risk getting nothing."
