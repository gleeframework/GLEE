"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to go a little higher. However, $850,000 is still a bit too much for my budget. I'm offering $800,000. This price is reasonable, as it's just above your valuation and would leave us both satisfied with the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
