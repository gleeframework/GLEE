Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $10,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message subtly emphasizes the ""value"" of the product, justifying the higher price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. Even if he rejects the initial offer, you still have John as a secure backup buyer."
