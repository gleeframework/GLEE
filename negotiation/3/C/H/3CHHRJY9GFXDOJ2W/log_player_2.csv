Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,210,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,230,000 for this exceptional product.  It's a fair price for both of us and will ensure you get incredible value for your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly very hesitant to drop below $1,230,000.  While we could try to push for a slightly better deal, the difference is getting smaller and we risk her walking away completely. Accepting at $1,230,000 secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the higher price."
