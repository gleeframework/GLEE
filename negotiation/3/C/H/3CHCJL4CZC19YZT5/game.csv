"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price point. How about $1,600,000?  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $1,450,000?  It's a good compromise and allows us both to move closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can close this out.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, Alice, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. Can you consider this price?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a bit concerned about our ability to reach an agreement. $1,300,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to make one final concession, but it needs to be closer to my minimum. How about $1,400,000?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",1350000.0,Bob,8,
