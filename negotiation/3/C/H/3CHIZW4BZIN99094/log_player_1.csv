"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you!  I'm offering it for $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $90, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and potentially more willing to negotiate. 
* **Open Ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and initiates the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  How about $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $80.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you're interested, Bob.  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price to $85, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Positivity:**  I'm staying upbeat and emphasizing my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Call to Action:** I'm ending with a clear statement that I'm open to finding a solution, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, Alice.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $80? That's my final offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable value.  While I'd prefer more, it's a good deal and ensures I don't lose out.  Accepting avoids further rounds of negotiation and guarantees a sale."
