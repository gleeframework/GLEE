"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's way too early to accept Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is way above your budget, and you have a better option with John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,200,000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Given the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to your budget, you can still do better.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you have the safety net of John's offer to fall back on if the negotiations stall.  Let's see if we can get her down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's right at the edge of my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900000 is still below what this product is truly worth to me. Considering its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $975000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's work towards a deal in this final stage of negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to your budget, but Alice is not willing to budge significantly.  At this point, it's better to take John's offer. You'll save $175,000 compared to Alice's latest offer."
