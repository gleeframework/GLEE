"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (value to Bob) makes the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $1,200,000 is still lower than what the product is worth to me, allowing for potential concessions. 
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the value to Bob might encourage him to consider the offer despite the initial price. 

**Important:** This is just the first round. I will carefully assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy for the subsequent rounds, keeping in mind my fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1200000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly less than what the product is worth to me, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I still have rounds left, and I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John's offer of $1,000,000 provides me with a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fall through. 

**Strategy for the next round:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $1,000,000, perhaps around $950,000. I'll emphasize the value of the product and reiterate the importance of finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Given the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, and closer to my desired outcome.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making the price seem more justified.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""win-win"" situation, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and making him feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for further compromise if necessary, allowing for a potential deal in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's right at the edge of my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. 
* **John's offer is a solid backup:**  I can easily sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which is a much better deal than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation potential remains:**  There are still a few rounds left, and I believe there's potential to convince Bob to increase his offer further.

**Strategy for the next round:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, likely around $975,000, emphasizing the value of the product and the fact that I'm already making a significant concession. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll be prepared to sell to John in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is still below what this product is truly worth to me. Considering its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's work towards a deal in this final stage of negotiation."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price again, but still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to his business, justifying the price.
* **Final Stage Appeal:**  I'm highlighting the limited remaining rounds, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum threshold while also being potentially acceptable to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* If Bob still rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to accept John's offer in the next round.
* The remaining rounds will require careful analysis of Bob's responses to determine the best strategy for maximizing my earnings."
