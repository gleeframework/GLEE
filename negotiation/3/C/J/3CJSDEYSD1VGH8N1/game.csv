"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I feel that would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
