"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept.  You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, so you have leverage to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $100 is a reasonable first step. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows Alice you're serious about getting a deal, but you're not going to accept her first price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved from $120 to $110, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. Since $110 is within my budget and I have limited rounds, it's a good idea to accept this offer and secure the product at a lower price."
