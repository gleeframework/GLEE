"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be just as valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a one-time opportunity, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it at that price if you decline.  Let me know if you're interested!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
