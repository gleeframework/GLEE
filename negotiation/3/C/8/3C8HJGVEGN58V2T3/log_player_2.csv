"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual top price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While low, $10,500 isn't ridiculously far off from Alice's asking price.  It suggests I'm serious but looking for a fair deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will give me an idea of how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is negotiating:** Her willingness to move down to $13,000 shows there's room for bargaining. 
* **Still above target:** $13,000 is still significantly higher than both my ideal price and Alice's value.
* **Room to negotiate:** I have room to increase my offer while staying well below John's $15,000 backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer is slightly closer to my previous offer than Alice's, but presents it as a compromise.
* **Staying Strategic:** I'm still below my $15,000 walk-away point, and significantly below Alice's initial asking price.
* **Encouraging a Deal:** By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm hoping to nudge Alice closer to a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking $14,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting close to my limit:** Her latest offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 less than John's price. 
* **Further negotiation unlikely:** Alice has framed this as her ""final concession."" It suggests she's unlikely to move much lower.
* **Not worth the risk:**  Continuing to negotiate has a high risk of ending up closer to $14,000. At this point, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to pay $15,000 to John."
