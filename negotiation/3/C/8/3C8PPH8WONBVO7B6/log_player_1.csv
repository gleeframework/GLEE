"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) but still lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($120).
* **Open Communication:** I'm being friendly and open to negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $100, I leave room for both of us to adjust the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Bob's offer of $90 is significantly higher than my minimum of $80. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's always a risk Bob will reject my counteroffer and I'll be left with the less desirable option of selling to John for $80. 
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good deal quickly and move on to other opportunities."
