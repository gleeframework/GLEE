"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering your own value for it, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. ",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $950,000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum price. I'm confident we can work together to make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
