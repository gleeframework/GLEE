Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $140. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
