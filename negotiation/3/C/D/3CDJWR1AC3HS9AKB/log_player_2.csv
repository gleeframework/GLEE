"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident the product is worth more to you than $1,050,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your offer of $1,150,000, I'm willing to reduce the price by another $50,000 to $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below John's offer. It's better to secure the product from John at $1,200,000 than to risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially lose out on the deal altogether."
