I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation.  I'm not willing to settle for that price yet."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price,  $1,300,000 is a good deal and  it's getting close to my target. It's better to close the deal now than risk losing him completely and having to settle with John for a lower price."
