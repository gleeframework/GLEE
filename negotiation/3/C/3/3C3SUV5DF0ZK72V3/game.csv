"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but  $850,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make a deal!",950000.0,Bob,4,
