Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** By mentioning that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, Alice is reminding him of its inherent value, justifying the higher asking price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The tone is open for discussion (""What do you think?"") making Bob feel like he has a say in the final price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a potential rejection from Bob. If she's highly risk-averse, she might offer a price closer to $10,000 to secure the sale. 
* The success of this offer depends on Bob's negotiation skills and willingness to pay a premium."
