"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $2,000 above Bob's maximum price. It's worth exploring the negotiation with Alice to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the unique qualities of this product,  $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, but he's also willing to negotiate. He starts with a lower price, but leaves some room for negotiation. He also expresses interest in the product to keep the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a deal at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000. Even though it's a lower price than the initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a better deal. He has several rounds left, and there's no guarantee that John will still be willing to sell the product at $10,000 if Bob decides to buy from him later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money, but he's now closer to Alice's offer.  He proposes a middle ground, showing a willingness to compromise and hopefully reach an agreement quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit higher than your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000, as that's the minimum I can sell it for to another buyer. I can offer you a compromise at $11,250. This is the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  There are only 5 rounds left, and it's getting increasingly likely that Bob won't be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  John is still offering the product for Bob's target price of $10,000, so it's in Bob's best interest to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
