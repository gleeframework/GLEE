"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident this will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm also not yet ready to sell to John as I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, reflecting the value this product will bring to your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is still outside my price range.  I'm prepared to go up to $900000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I see in your product. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have John as a backup option.  It's important for me to remember that my goal is to maximize my earnings, and settling for $900,000 might leave me feeling like I could have done better."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique benefits this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll be getting. I'm open to discussing further, but this is my final offer for now."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, I've already negotiated for several rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Also,  John is offering the same amount.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me my minimum, and I can move on to other opportunities."
