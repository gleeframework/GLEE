"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $800000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $800000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my limits. I'm thinking of $650000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $675000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you. I hope we can meet in the middle.",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more counteroffer, Alice, but I'm afraid $675000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm going to have to go with my original counteroffer from round 4, which is $650000. I'm hoping you can accept this price.",650000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $650000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $670000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",670000.0,Alice,7,
