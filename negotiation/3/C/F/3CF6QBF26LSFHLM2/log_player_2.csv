"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($600,000), we create room for negotiation and gauge Alice's willingness to move from her initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This counteroffer doesn't go as low as our absolute maximum ($800,000) because we want to leave space to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's time and clearly states our position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $800,000. This price reflects the value it brings to you while still allowing me to recover a fair amount. I'm confident this is a win-win proposition.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.
