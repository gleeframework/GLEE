Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my highest desired price, $12,000. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this initially, it sets a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't sell for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $11,500. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my desired price of $12,000 and his offer of $10,000. This shows good faith and hopefully encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
