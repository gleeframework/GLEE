"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, and this price gives us a good starting point for bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While $90 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get even closer to my ideal price,  $95 is a good deal considering the value of the product to Bob. It's significantly more than selling to John, and we're nearing the end of our rounds. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
