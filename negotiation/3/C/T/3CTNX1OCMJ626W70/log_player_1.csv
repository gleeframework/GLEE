I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While we're getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with a price below $950,000.  With only four rounds left, I'm hoping to push for a better deal or at least secure the $950,000 offer."

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time and bargaining power. While I'd prefer a higher price, selling to John for $800,000 is still a good outcome and ensures I don't risk getting a worse deal with Bob in the final rounds."
