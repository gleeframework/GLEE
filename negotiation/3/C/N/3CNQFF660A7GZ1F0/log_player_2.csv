"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's important to establish a starting point within a reasonable range of your $1,000,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I need a more realistic price point. I'm willing to offer $800,000."", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price but well within our budget. This creates room for negotiation and gauges her willingness to come down.
* **Direct & Polite:**  The message is clear, direct, and respectful, avoiding any confrontational language."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe your initial offer undervalues the true potential of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I'm confident this revised price reflects a more balanced approach. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's counteroffer is still significantly higher than your $1,000,000 limit. While she made a substantial reduction, it's important to signal that you're serious about staying within a reasonable budget. Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're willing to work within that range, I'm very interested. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** It's time to be more assertive and set a clear boundary. We're revealing our maximum budget but framing it as a firm limit. 
* **Introducing Alternatives:** By mentioning ""other options"" (John), we're subtly letting Alice know we have a backup plan and won't be pressured into overpaying. This might incentivize her to move closer to our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've tried to be flexible, but to be frank, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I consider fair for this product.  However, I value our discussions and I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,350,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit, it's still significantly above your $1,000,000 maximum.  
* **Negotiating Power:** You still have time and the option of buying from John. This gives you leverage to push for a better deal. 

Let's see if Alice is willing to come down further in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I respect your position.  While your latest offer is tempting, it's still a stretch for me.  I can offer you $1,100,000. That's a significant increase on my end and shows I'm serious about finding a solution. I believe this price is fair for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're making a significant jump in our offer to demonstrate a willingness to meet Alice closer to the middle. 
* **Justification:** We're clearly explaining the reasoning behind the counteroffer, emphasizing it's a big move on your end.
* **Pressure and Encouragement:**  We're still below our maximum budget but hinting that this might be our final offer. This could encourage Alice to accept rather than risk the deal falling through."
