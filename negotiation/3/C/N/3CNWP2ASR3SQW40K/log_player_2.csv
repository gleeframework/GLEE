(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $967,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still higher than my ideal price. While I've gotten a good discount, I'm at the point where I'm getting close to my maximum budget.  Since I only have one more round and I'm not sure I can convince Alice to go lower, it's safer to buy from John at a guaranteed price of $800,000."
