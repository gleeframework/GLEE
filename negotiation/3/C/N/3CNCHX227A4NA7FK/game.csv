"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? That would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $107? That would be a good compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy.",107.0,Bob,4,
