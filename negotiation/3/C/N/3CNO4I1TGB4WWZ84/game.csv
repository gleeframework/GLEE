"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is valued at no less than $800000 to me, but I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to the right buyer.  I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer. It's an intriguing product, but  $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $750000 is a fair offer, I'm still looking to get closer to the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This would allow me to still achieve a good return and hopefully gives you a price point that makes sense.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825000. This would be a good deal for both of us and hopefully, we can finalize the transaction.",825000.0,Bob,4,
