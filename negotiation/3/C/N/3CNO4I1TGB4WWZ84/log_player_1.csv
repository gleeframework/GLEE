Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer. It's an intriguing product, but  $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This would allow me to still achieve a good return and hopefully gives you a price point that makes sense.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
