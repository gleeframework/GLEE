"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is valued at no less than $800000 to me, but I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to the right buyer.  I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at the top of your budget. There's no reason to accept it immediately. By rejecting, you open the opportunity for negotiation and potentially save some money.  You can start by making a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer. It's an intriguing product, but  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. It signals that you're serious about buying but also value your budget. This approach might encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $750000 is a fair offer, I'm still looking to get closer to the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This would allow me to still achieve a good return and hopefully gives you a price point that makes sense.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but she's still above your ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and hopefully, we can finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her previous offer and your previous offer. This shows you are willing to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial price.  It may also incentivize Alice to accept your offer as it represents a significant saving compared to her initial offer."
