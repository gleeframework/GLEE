Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80, giving me a profit if he accepts.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a calculated risk. If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for $80, ensuring I don't lose money."
