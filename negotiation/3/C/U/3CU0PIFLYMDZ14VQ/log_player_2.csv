"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is the minimum value I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd like to pursue further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is offering the product at your maximum budget. There's no room for negotiation to get a better price, and waiting carries the risk of Alice increasing her offer."
