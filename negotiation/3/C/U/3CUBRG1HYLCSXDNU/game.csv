"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're putting on your product, I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. It's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's find a way to make this work.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $9,000, but that's truly my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate you coming up to $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",9500.0,Alice,5,
