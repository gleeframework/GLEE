Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $110, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, after all!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $117?"",
""product_price"": 117
}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $117, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $128? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Explanation: Alice is not moving towards a reasonable price. She increased her offer from $125 to $128. It's unlikely we'll reach a price below $125 at this rate, making John's offer of $150 a better option now.  It's better to cut our losses and secure the product."
