This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a bit more than my minimum value, but leaving room for negotiation. It's a good balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation open."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less than $1,250,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I'd like to get the highest price possible, I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to counteroffer again and try to push him a little higher."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $1,130,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

While I would like to get a higher price, Bob's counteroffer is getting too close to my minimum. To ensure I don't risk losing out completely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's not the highest possible price, but it's a secure deal that meets my minimum requirement."
