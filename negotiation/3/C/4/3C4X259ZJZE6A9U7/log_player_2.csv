"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has increased her offer, it's still not within Bob's ideal price range.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Buying from John at $1,200,000 is still a worse option than continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000 and closer to his desired price than John's offer.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice could become unwilling to sell at all, leaving Bob with only John's higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price."
