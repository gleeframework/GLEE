"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  I cannot afford to sell at this price.
* **I still have 9 rounds to reach a better agreement with Bob.**  There's room for negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed $10,000, but it's not the best outcome.**  I want to try to get a better price from Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. My minimum selling price is $10,000. I'm confident the product's value to you justifies this price. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 10000}
