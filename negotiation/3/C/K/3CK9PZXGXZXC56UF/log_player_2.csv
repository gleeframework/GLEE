Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $11,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
