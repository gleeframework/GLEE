"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $11,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth to both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
