{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000 to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and making the offer sound appealing to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion by asking for Bob's thoughts.

This initial offer is a starting point. I'll be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000? I appreciate your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price of $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500, considering your budget constraints. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents excellent value for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while still trying to secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the new price as a compromise to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Value emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob about the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm still open to further discussion by asking for Bob's feedback. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still allowing for potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $15500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of further negotiation and a potential rejection leading to the $12,000 offer from John makes accepting Bob's offer the most prudent choice. It ensures I secure a price that's significantly higher than my minimum and mitigates the risk of a less favorable outcome."
