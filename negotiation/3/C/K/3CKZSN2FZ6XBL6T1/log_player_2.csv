"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $175. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offered price is way higher than your budget and what John offers. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering. $175 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual budget. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price is too high.
* **Polite and Positive:** I want to maintain a good negotiating relationship, so I'm framing my counteroffer politely. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer helps gauge how flexible Alice might be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $120? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $120 is still above both your budget and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice. I appreciate the effort.  How about we settle at $100?  That's the most I can justify spending."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:**  I'm stating my maximum budget directly to signal this is my best offer. 
* **Justification:** Giving a reason (budget constraints) makes my position more understandable.
* **Last Chance:** This is a ""take it or leave it"" offer. If Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $130? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice isn't budging enough. Her latest offer is still significantly above your budget and John's price.
* **No More Wiggle Room:** You've been clear about your maximum budget, and further haggling is unlikely to succeed.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed option with John at $100. It's time to cut your losses and buy from him."
