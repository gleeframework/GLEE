"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at a slightly lower price.  How about $1,700,000? This is a great opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.",1700000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I could go up to $1,275,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but we're still not close enough. Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to drop to $1,350,000. If you're truly interested in this product, this is a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident you won't find a better offer.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,312,500?  It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired outcomes.",1312500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  Let's try $1,330,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair deal for a product worth at least $1,500,000 to you.",1330000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting very close to my limit.  I can do $1,320,000, but that's absolutely the best I can offer.",1320000.0,Bob,8,
