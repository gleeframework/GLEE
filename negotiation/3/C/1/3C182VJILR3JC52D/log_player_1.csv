Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at a slightly lower price.  How about $1,700,000? This is a great opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is not a reasonable starting point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I could go up to $1,275,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to increase his offer, $1,275,000 is still too low. I'm not willing to drop below $1,400,000 at this point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but we're still not close enough. Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to drop to $1,350,000. If you're truly interested in this product, this is a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident you won't find a better offer."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,312,500?  It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired outcomes. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,312,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer, but I'm still not ready to settle for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  Let's try $1,330,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair deal for a product worth at least $1,500,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 1330000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting very close to my limit.  I can do $1,320,000, but that's absolutely the best I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my target. With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high.  I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to guarantee a solid profit."
