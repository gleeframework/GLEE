"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price just above Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to budge a bit. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, hoping to establish a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I want to close a deal, I'm not desperate and need to maintain my value. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives you a good deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my range.  How about we split the difference and do $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my product's worth. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $11,625? This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11625}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting pretty close.  I could be persuaded to go up to $11,400, but that's really as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. $11,400 is still significantly lower than my desired price, and I believe I can still get closer to my target. I'll counteroffer once more to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,400 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $11,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  It's a great deal for you, and it helps me achieve my goal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
