"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives you a good deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my range.  How about we split the difference and do $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $11,625? This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",11625.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting pretty close.  I could be persuaded to go up to $11,400, but that's really as high as I can go.",11400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,400 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $11,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  It's a great deal for you, and it helps me achieve my goal.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,7,
