"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets the stage for a negotiation and allows for potential concessions later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit to show willingness to compromise, but still keeping it above my minimum. This keeps the pressure on Bob, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is sticking to his $1,200,000 offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll reject and try to get a higher counteroffer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping the price again, but this time to $1,600,000.  It's getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows a genuine willingness to compromise while keeping the pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm close to my minimum, I still think I can get a slightly higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little further. I still have some room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm getting close to Bob's offer now.  I'm dropping the price to $1,300,000, which is just above his last offer, but still above my minimum.   This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low for me.  Even though I have two more rounds, the risk of getting a lower offer is too high.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum and allows me to move on."
