"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down on the price? I was thinking closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $85. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",85.0,Alice,5,
