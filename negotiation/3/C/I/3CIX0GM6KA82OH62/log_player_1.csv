Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll see.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for a price between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000) creates a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting me closer to my ideal selling price.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and my belief in a fair deal. This can make Bob more receptive to the offer."
