"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm not sure $100 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that?,95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $97.50. This would be a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not getting any closer to your price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $96, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that?",96.0,Bob,6,
