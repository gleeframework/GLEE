"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm offering $115. This is a fair price, given the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $10.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $120. This is a fair price, considering your value for the product. I hope we can find common ground on this, as I'm really interested in purchasing it.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $122.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",122.5,Alice,5,
