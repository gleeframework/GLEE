"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's asking for $130. You can likely get a better deal.
* **You have time:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no need to rush.
* **John is a fallback option:** If the negotiation fails, you can always buy from John for $150. 

**Next Steps:** You will now make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm offering $115. This is a fair price, given the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  Offering $115 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above her value of $120. This shows you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the product's value to both of you emphasizes the fairness of the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves room for further discussion and counteroffers, keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $10. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $125 is still above her value of $120.  She's clearly trying to make a profit, and you can still push for a better deal.
* **You have more room to negotiate:** You've already shown Alice you're serious about getting a lower price.  There's still room to make a counteroffer and try to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing you have John's offer of $150 gives you confidence to hold firm in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:** You'll need to make another counteroffer to Alice.  See if you can close the gap between your desired price and Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $120. This is a fair price, considering your value for the product. I hope we can find common ground on this, as I'm really interested in purchasing it."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer (for now):** This counteroffer is very close to Alice's value of $120. It shows you are serious about purchasing the product but are not willing to overpay. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  Again, mentioning the product's value to both of you reinforces the idea of a fair deal.
* **Positive language:**  The message maintains a positive tone, suggesting a willingness to collaborate rather than fight.

**Next Steps:** Hopefully, this counteroffer will be agreeable to Alice. However, if she rejects it, you'll need to decide whether to make another offer or go to John's offer of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $122.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:**  Alice's offer of $122.5 is only $2.50 above your desired price of $120.  It's a very small difference.
* **Limited time:**  You are now in round 5.  With only 5 rounds left, there's less time to negotiate further.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  While John's offer of $150 is a safety net, it's significantly more expensive. Accepting this offer saves you $27.50.

**Next Steps:**  You've successfully negotiated a good deal, getting the price down from $130 to $122.50 in just 5 rounds. You should be happy with this outcome."
