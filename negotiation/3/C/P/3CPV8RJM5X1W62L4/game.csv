"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let me see if I can do $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $14000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $14000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think it's worth it. Let me see if I can do $16500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart, Alice. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll offer $13500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make one more serious offer. However, $13500 is still a bit below my target.

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one final offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll offer $13000. This is my last offer, so I hope you can consider it.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to make one last attempt. However, $13000 is still a bit below my target, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower. I'm starting to think that selling to John for $15000 might be the better option for me. Let me see if I can do $16250. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it.",16250.0,Alice,9,
