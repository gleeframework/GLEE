Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's valuation of $12,000, but still lower than my minimum desired value of $15,000. This strategy aims to maximize the chance of Bob accepting the offer while ensuring I still get a decent price for the product. If Bob rejects, I can confidently sell to John for my minimum desired price."
