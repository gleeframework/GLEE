"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $110. 
* You can get the product from John for $120, but that's your maximum price.
* Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to get the product for a lower price (potentially from Alice in a future negotiation, or from someone else)."
