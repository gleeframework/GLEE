"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it provides. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to get a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I'm getting a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a positive negotiating environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  I believe I can still get a better price by countering Bob's offer and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me a strong position and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer the product for $10,500. This is still a good price for you and ensures I'm getting a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** By suggesting a price in the middle, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to Bob to remind him it's worth more than $10,000.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:**  I keep the message friendly and encouraging to maintain a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and staying within my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10200. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  John's offer provides me with a fallback option, allowing me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,200 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value this product provides, how about we settle at $10,750? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing the price by a smaller amount this time, showing willingness to compromise while staying closer to my desired range.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the ""fair price"" and ""happy outcome"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and potential for a successful transaction.
* **Continued Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open and collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, and I'd like to propose a price of $10500. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Getting Closer:** We are getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, so I'm not going to sell to John yet.
* **Opportunity to Counter:** I believe I can still get a better price by countering Bob's offer. I'm confident I can reach a deal that is closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference one more time. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,625. This price acknowledges the value of the product while also being within your budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10625}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Again, I'm suggesting a price in the middle to show willingness to compromise and move the negotiation forward. 
* **Acknowledging Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product while staying within Bob's budget to appeal to his sense of fairness.
* **Final Push:** With only a few rounds left, I need to push for a price closer to my target, but I'm still leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your latest offer, but I would like to propose a price of $10400. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and I need to make a decision. 
* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has come up in price, his offer of $10,400 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, which is significantly better than what Bob is offering. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate and result in me getting less than what John is offering.

By selling to John, I'm ensuring a profitable sale and avoiding the risk of ending up with a lower price."
