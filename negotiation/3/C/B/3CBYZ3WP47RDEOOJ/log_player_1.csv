"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value for the product, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also aware of John's offer of $80, which gives me a fallback option if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than my initial offer, and it's already above my minimum value for the product. Accepting his offer is the best option in this round."
