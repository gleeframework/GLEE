{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation to reach a price that benefits both of us.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target.  I'll counteroffer to try and find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,400,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay the same amount.  Selling to John ensures a quick and certain transaction without the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
