Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a strong starting offer that's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals your confidence in the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than $80 from John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
