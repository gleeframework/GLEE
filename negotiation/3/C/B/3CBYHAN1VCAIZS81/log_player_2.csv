"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than John's price, you can likely do better. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $80. There's room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject your counteroffer again, and you might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.  At $110, you're still saving a significant amount compared to John, and the negotiation process has likely taken some time. It's reasonable to accept this offer."
