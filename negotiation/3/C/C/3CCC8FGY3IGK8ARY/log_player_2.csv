"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her perceived value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This still leaves room for you to make a profit and allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and see if they can reach a mutually agreeable price. There's still room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This offers a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Since Bob can purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, it's in his best interest to buy from John and avoid further negotiation.  This guarantees the best possible price and avoids any further risk of Alice not accepting a counteroffer."
