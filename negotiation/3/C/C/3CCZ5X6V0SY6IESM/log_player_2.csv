"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500.  This is higher than Bob's maximum price of $10,000.
* **John's price:** $10,000. This is Bob's maximum price, but he can still do better if Alice negotiates down.
* **Strategy:** Reject Alice's offer and see if Alice will lower her price.  There are still 9 rounds to go, and Bob can still get the product at a lower price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's strategy:** Start with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Counteroffer price:** $8,500 is a substantial reduction from Alice's offer, but still above Alice's minimum selling price of $8,000. This leaves room for potential compromise. 
* **Message:** The message is polite and direct, expressing interest while stating Bob's price point clearly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,000.  This is still higher than Bob's desired price.
* **John's price:** $10,000. Bob can still potentially get a better price than this.
* **Strategy:** Reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating. There are still 7 rounds remaining to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's strategy:** Continue to negotiate by making a counteroffer closer to Alice's offer.
* **Counteroffer price:** $8,750 is a compromise, halfway between Bob's previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's offer of $9,000.
* **Message:** The message remains polite but firm, expressing appreciation for Alice's flexibility while reiterating Bob's price point."
