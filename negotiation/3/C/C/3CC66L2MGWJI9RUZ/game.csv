"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
