"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. This price reflects a fair market value and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the product's potential and allows for a reasonable profit margin on both sides.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
