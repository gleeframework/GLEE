Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While it's a significant decrease, it's still over his budget. Bob should reject and try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a price we both find agreeable.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to drop my price significantly to $12,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a considerable compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still over Bob's budget. He's already made it clear he's not willing to go over $8,500.  It's better to move on and buy the product from John for $8,000, which is within his price range."
