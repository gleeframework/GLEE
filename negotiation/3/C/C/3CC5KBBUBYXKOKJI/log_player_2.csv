"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth to me, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $120. This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a product that is truly worth more, at a significant discount. I hope you find this offer appealing and look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your $80 maximum and what John offers. You can do better by rejecting this offer."
