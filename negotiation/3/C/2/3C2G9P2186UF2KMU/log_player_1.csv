Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it provides excellent value at this price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can aim higher with Bob to potentially earn more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $30 markup (25% over your minimum) is a common starting point in negotiations.  It allows room for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a good profit for you.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights ""value"" and ""confidence"" to make the offer more appealing to Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $120 is Bob's maximum value, he might be willing to pay slightly more if he perceives the product as a good deal or if the negotiation process is smooth.
* **Negotiation Style:** This initial offer sets a slightly ambitious target, leaving room for potential negotiation. If you want to be more flexible or aggressive, you can adjust the initial offer accordingly."
