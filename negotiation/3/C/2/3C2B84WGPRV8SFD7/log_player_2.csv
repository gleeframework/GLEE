"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth starting a counteroffer negotiation to see if we can get closer to my $80 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?

$130 is still too high.  I'm willing to go a bit higher than my initial offer, but I don't want to go all the way to $130.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."
