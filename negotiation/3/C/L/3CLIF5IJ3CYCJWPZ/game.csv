"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
