"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, and we can reach a deal that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm going to try to get a better offer from Bob in the next round.  If he doesn't come up, selling to John at $150 is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but they are still below what I'm comfortable with. At this point, with only 4 rounds left, it's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed $150 from John. I'm confident that I can find another buyer later if needed."
