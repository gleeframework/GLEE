Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to be friendly and persuasive to encourage Bob to accept. 

Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm going to counter-offer to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price, considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above his initial offer. I'm hoping that a compromise will make him see the value of the product and seal the deal."
