"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer to get us started. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's opening offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to enter a negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more than $850000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his maximum.  Bob has room to negotiate further, and potentially secure a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and my financial limits. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $920000. This is the lowest price I can accept, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $920000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is still too high for Bob.  Although he has a few more rounds to negotiate,  the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing out on the opportunity to buy from John is too high. 

Buying from John at $800,000 is a guaranteed deal within Bob's budget. It's the best course of action in this situation, as further negotiation with Alice might lead to a stalemate and losing the opportunity to purchase from John."
