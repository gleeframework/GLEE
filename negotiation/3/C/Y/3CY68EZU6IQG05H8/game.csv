"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land at $8,750. This price would be a win-win for both of us, as it's closer to your value and still allows me to save some money.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,750 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product offers. Let me know what you think.",9200.0,Alice,5,
