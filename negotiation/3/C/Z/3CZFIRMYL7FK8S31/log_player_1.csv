Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my financial constraints.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is my final offer.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. At this point, the increments are relatively small, and it's unlikely Bob will drastically increase his offer.  It's time to push a bit harder to see if he's truly serious."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be transparent.  My absolute lowest price for this product is $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll be receiving.  If this works for you, I'm happy to finalize the deal today."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** By stating this is my ""absolute lowest,"" I'm signaling to Bob that there's no more room for negotiation. This adds weight to the offer.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the value proposition reminds Bob of the potential benefits, justifying the price. 
* **Call to Action:**  Offering to ""finalize the deal today"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages a quick decision."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that $1,000,000 is your lowest price, but I'm still not comfortable with that. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, which is my final offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my financial constraints. If you're willing to accept this price, I'm ready to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has not significantly increased his offer after my firm stance in round 7.  This indicates he's unlikely to meet my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob for a lower amount."
