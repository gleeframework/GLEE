"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I understand it's a bit high, but I think it's worth more than that. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I see the value in the product, $850,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  Could we settle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product at this price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
