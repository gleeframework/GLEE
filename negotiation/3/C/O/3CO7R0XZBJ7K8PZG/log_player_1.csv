Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **My Minimum:**  My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000 (what I'd get from John).
* **Negotiation:**  By offering $1,400,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation. Bob has a $100,000 potential gain, which is a decent incentive to accept. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** While I'm aiming for the highest price, I'm still comfortable with John's offer as a fallback."
