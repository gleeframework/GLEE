"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that the product looks fantastic, but I think $1,200,000 is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle at $950,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is the highest I can go, and I think it's still a good compromise considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
