Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll get a deal significantly better than John's offer of $150.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
