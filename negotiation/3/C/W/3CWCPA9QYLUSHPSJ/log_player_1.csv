Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** The lowest price you'll accept is $1,500,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum value.  This makes the negotiation tricky.

**Strategy**

Since Bob values the product at less than your minimum, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor:**  Start with a very high price (significantly above $1,500,000) hoping Bob might negotiate down, but still within a range acceptable to you. This is risky, as Bob might immediately reject the offer.
2. **Direct Deal with John:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at your desired price, bypass negotiations with Bob and proceed directly to John.

**Offer (Option 1 - High Anchor)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its rarity and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have a counter-proposal."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Offer (Option 2 - Direct Deal)**

In this case, you wouldn't send an offer to Bob. You would proceed directly to John to secure your $1,500,000.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is crucial, a highly aggressive opening price might be detrimental.
* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation tactics, you can tailor your approach accordingly.

**Ultimately, the best approach depends on your risk tolerance and the importance of your relationship with Bob.**"
