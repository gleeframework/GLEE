"Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a reasonable price.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $95?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $65 for it.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you letting me know what you're willing to pay. While I value your business, $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $70 is still too far below what I need to sell the product for.  How about we compromise at $75?  I think this price is fair for both of us.",75.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. How about $72? That's a fair compromise.",72.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $72 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $74 for this product.  Let's close this deal.",74.0,Alice,7,
