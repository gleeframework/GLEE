"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I understand you also see the value in this product.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I'm aiming to make this a win-win situation for both of us.  How about we settle at $995,000?  This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",995000.0,Alice,5,
