Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to start by asking for my minimum price.  Bob might reject, but if he does, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $11,000. This is a significant drop from my initial price, but still above my minimum. It's also closer to his offer of $9,000, which might make it more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly closer to my minimum price than his previous offer, and it's still more than what he was initially willing to pay.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better price if I keep negotiating, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  It's time to close this deal."
