"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to my maximum limit of $800,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, the product's value significantly exceeds your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I still feel that $800,000 would be a more reasonable price given the current market conditions and my financial situation. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to this figure.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,050,000.  This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's more than fair. Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've carefully considered your latest offer and, while it's a step in the right direction, I still believe that $800,000 would be a fair price for the product. I understand the value it holds, but given my financial constraints, I hope we can find a middle ground that respects both our positions. Thank you for your understanding.",800000.0,Bob,6,
