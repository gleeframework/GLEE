Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more around $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, I'm not comfortable with $1,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise and a significant improvement over Bob's initial offer. Accepting this offer is better than risking another round of negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
