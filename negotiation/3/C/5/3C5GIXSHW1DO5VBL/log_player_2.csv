"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's a $50,000 discount, which is a good starting point. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, and Alice likely wants to sell. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  It's important to keep this in mind, but it's not the best value right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $50,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant move, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to negotiate further. If she rejects it, you can adjust your strategy accordingly.
* **Still within your budget:**  You're still below your maximum, leaving room for potential concessions if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down:** This offer is closer to your initial counteroffer, showing that she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Good value:** A $75,000 discount from the original price is a significant saving. 
* **Time is money:** While you could try to squeeze out a few more thousand, the risk of further negotiation and potential delays isn't worth it. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds."
