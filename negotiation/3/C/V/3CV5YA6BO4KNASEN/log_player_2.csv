Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $138.25? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice has come down a lot and I'm concerned I might lose the deal and be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  $138.25 is still within my budget and a good deal."
