"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to capture a good chunk of the value difference.  It also emphasizes the mutual benefit to build rapport. We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about $700,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While we want to close the deal, we shouldn't settle for a price that undervalues our product. We will counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet in the middle. How about $850,000? This gives us both a fair deal and ensures we can close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel there's room for negotiation. How about $800,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets our minimum acceptable price. While we might be able to squeeze a little more out of him,  accepting this offer ensures we close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  We also don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's offer."
