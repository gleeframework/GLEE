"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to do $8,500? That's still a great price for you, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $9,000 for the product. This still allows for a significant profit while considering your budget constraints. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little out of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? That would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product and your budget, I am willing to agree on a price of $8,900. This allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive with your offer. I hope this meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",8900.0,Alice,5,
