"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she is offering it for $90.  This leaves very little room for negotiation.
* **There's potential for a better deal:** Since you have 10 rounds and Alice is motivated to sell, there's a good chance you can get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  You have a safety net in John who will sell for $100, so you're not pressured to accept a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  Offering $85 is a significant discount from Alice's offer, demonstrating you're serious about negotiating.
* **Testing the waters:** This price is still above Alice's valuation, but it allows us to gauge her willingness to compromise.
* **Room for adjustment:** If she rejects, we can adjust our offer slightly higher in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer:**  Alice's offer of $87 is much closer to my desired price. 
* **It's a fair deal:**  While I could potentially get a slightly lower price, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to buy from John for $100 outweighs the potential small gain. 
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the greater the chance of unforeseen circumstances or a change in Alice's mind. It's best to secure a good deal while it's available."
