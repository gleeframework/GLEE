Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'm also being transparent about the value of the product, hoping to establish a foundation of trust."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise, I can encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to $800,000.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't go lower than $825,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and still leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept, but also framing it as a ""middle ground"" to make it seem like a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $790,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $790,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer one more time, hoping to reach an agreement. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $805,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 805000} 
```

I'm going to make one final push with Bob, hoping to get a price closer to my minimum.  I'm emphasizing the compromise I'm making, and framing it as a win-win situation for both of us.  If he rejects this, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $785,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where further negotiations with Bob are unlikely to yield a better price. While I'd prefer to earn more, it's getting late in the game. I'm not comfortable risking another round and potentially losing the deal completely. John offers a safe and secure alternative, guaranteeing me my minimum profit.  I'll sell to John."
