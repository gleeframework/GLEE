I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still gets me closer to my desired profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this deal and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell the product for $12,000. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."

I'm offering a price of $13,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I hope Bob will see this as a fair price considering his initial offer and be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not going to continue negotiating with Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's a guaranteed sale that will bring me my desired profit."
