"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal work. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to Bob, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option to maximize savings."
