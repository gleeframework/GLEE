"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering it leaves a significant profit margin for you.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, as it allows me to acquire the product while still providing you with a substantial profit.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
