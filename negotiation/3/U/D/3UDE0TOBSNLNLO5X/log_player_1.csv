Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire something incredibly valuable for a price that reflects its worth. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the value it holds.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you have leverage to start high. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without being overly specific. This piques Bob's interest and justifies the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but suggests a starting point for discussion. This keeps the door open for Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, the goal is to maximize profit.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum."
