"Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $800000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000 to meet you halfway. This still leaves a significant margin for me, but also allows for a profitable deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still unable to go above $800000 for the product. I would like to propose $900000 as a compromise. I hope this meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference: I'm happy to accept $950000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I think $950000 is a bit steep for my budget. I would like to propose $925000 as a compromise. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can finalize the purchase.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $925000 is closer to where I need to be, it's still slightly below my minimum.  I'm willing to accept $940000 as a final offer. This allows us to both make a reasonable profit while concluding this negotiation. I'm confident this is a fair compromise. Please let me know your decision.",940000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I'm glad we could narrow down the price. I would like to propose $935000 as the final price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects our respective positions. I hope this proposal is agreeable to you.",935000.0,Bob,8,
