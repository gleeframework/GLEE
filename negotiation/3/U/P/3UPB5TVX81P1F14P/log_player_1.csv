Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone sets a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  While $110 is unlikely to be accepted by Bob immediately, it establishes a strong starting point.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  By being open to negotiation, I encourage Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation process alive. 
* **Maintain a good relationship:**  A positive and open approach builds a better rapport with Bob, which could be beneficial if the negotiation continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed outcome, I believe I can still potentially get closer to my desired price range by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer signals that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to hold out for a better deal. 

**Next Step:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $100. My goal is to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  While $90 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer but still maintain a price that is above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight that this is a ""great deal"" for Bob, reinforcing the value of the product and encouraging acceptance.
* **Positive Tone:** I continue the friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport. 

**Strategy:**

By offering $95, I aim to:

* **Find a middle ground:** This price is a compromise that is likely to be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer.
* **Signal flexibility:** Showing a willingness to negotiate demonstrates that I'm serious about selling to Bob.
* **Increase the likelihood of acceptance:**  The offer is still a good deal for me, making it a strong negotiating point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $85. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me my minimum profit. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  While I'm open to negotiation, continuing this back-and-forth is unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum. 

**Conclusion:**

While I value a good deal with Bob, it's not worth risking selling below my minimum.  Selling to John secures a fair profit and avoids any further negotiation hassle."
