Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, he's moving too slowly. At this pace, it will take several more rounds to reach a price I find acceptable. It's not worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
