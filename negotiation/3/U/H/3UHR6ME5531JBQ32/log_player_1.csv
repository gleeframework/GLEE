"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price of $1,500,000. It's a significant value, and I believe it will be a great investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation.  Bob's initial counteroffer is too low, and I want to see if I can get a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately not feasible for me.  I'm willing to compromise, however. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? This price reflects the product's true value while still providing a fair deal for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'd like to propose $1250000 as a compromise between our positions. This price still allows us to find a balance between the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price and a significant improvement from his previous offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer allows me to close the deal without risking further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate.  At this point, it's a good deal and minimizes the risk of losing the sale to John."
