"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this incredible item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is an incredibly good deal! Alice is offering the product for significantly less than its value to her and well below your maximum budget.  It's highly unlikely you'll get a better offer."
