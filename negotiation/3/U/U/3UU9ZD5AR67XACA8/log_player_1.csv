Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you first dibs on a product I think you'll really value. I'm asking for $110. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) maximizes your potential profit. However, starting too high might make Bob reject the offer outright.  
* **Chosen Price:** $110 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin for you. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, you increase the likelihood of a sale while ensuring a substantial profit if he accepts."
