"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's a good starting point to negotiate, but it's not acceptable yet.  Bob should reject the offer and counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product but my budget is capped at $1,000,000.  Let's start with that figure and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering the product for $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while providing you with a substantial value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $1,250,000 is still above Bob's budget. Bob should reject the offer and counter with a price closer to his maximum.  It's still early in the negotiations, and Bob has time to work towards a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your financial limitations, $1,125,000 is still a significant gap from my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,375,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's aim for a final agreement in this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,375,000 is still above Bob's budget, and they have only a few rounds left. It's becoming increasingly clear that they won't reach an agreement.  Given that John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum budget, it makes sense for Bob to buy the product from John and avoid further negotiation."
