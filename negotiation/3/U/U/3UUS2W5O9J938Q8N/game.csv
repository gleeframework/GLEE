"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $120 is a bit low for me. I can meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $135 for it. Can you consider that?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125, and that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you the lowest price I can, and you're repeating the same offer. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll do $128, but that's my final offer.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $128 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125, and that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I won't go below $128, and you're still offering $125. I'm starting to think it's time to move on. However, I'll make one last attempt to close the deal. I'll meet you at $127, but that's it. After this, I'm selling to someone else.",127.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to close the deal, but $127 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $126, and that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",126.0,Bob,10,
