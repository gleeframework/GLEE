This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob is now offering the same amount you'd get from John ($1,500,000). 
* **Time Investment:** You've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now avoids potential further haggling and the risk of Bob lowering his offer. 
* **Uncertainty of Further Negotiation:** While you could try for more, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and you risk him walking away."
