Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, but still below the value I place on the product. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Addressing Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's unique nature and potential value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to negotiation (""What do you think?""). 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on his offer and my willingness to negotiate.
* **Stalemate:** If negotiations reach a point where I feel like we're too far apart, I'll switch to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product might be high to you, but I am only able to pay up to $1400000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still High:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value ($1,000,000), I believe there's still room for negotiation.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I'm optimistic that I can convince Bob to go a bit higher with a counteroffer. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit, but it's less than I hope to make.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000 to see if we can reach an agreement. It's a fair price considering the unique value of this product. Let's keep the negotiation going. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer, but not by too much.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's unique value to justify my price. 
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to further negotiation (""What do you think?"").  

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Excellent! I've secured a good price.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll consider his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or switch to John.
* **Stalemate:** If negotiations become too difficult, I'll consider selling to John for $1,000,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1425000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still making sure I am getting good value for my investment. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
