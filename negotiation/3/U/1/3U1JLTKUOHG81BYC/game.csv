"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing the details further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its market value. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $850,000, which is closer to my target and I believe is a fair price for both of us. ",850000.0,Bob,4,
