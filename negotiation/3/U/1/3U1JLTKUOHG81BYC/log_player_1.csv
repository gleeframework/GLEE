Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $850,000, which is closer to my target and I believe is a fair price for both of us.
