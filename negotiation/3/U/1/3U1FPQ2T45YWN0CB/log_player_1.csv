Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""great deal for the value,""  I'm creating a sense of urgency and subtly implying the price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in discussion rather than just a flat yes or no. 

While I have a backup buyer, I want to maximize my profit if possible. This offer gives me a good starting point with Bob."
