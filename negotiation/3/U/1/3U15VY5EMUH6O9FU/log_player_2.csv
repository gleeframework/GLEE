It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  Since your maximum is $150, there's room to negotiate."

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to budge. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation."

We're getting closer, but there's still some wiggle room. Let's try to get a little lower."

Round 4

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying, but still trying to stay below my $150 limit."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's offer is getting close to my limit. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's better to accept and save some money rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up buying from John at a higher price."
