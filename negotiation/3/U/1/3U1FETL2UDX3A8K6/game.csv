"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and my financial capacity.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our discussion, $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, reflecting the unique benefits this product offers. It's a significant investment, but one that will deliver substantial returns for your business. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
