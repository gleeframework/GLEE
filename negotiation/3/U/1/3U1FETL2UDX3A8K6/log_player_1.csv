{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that can be incredibly beneficial to your business. I'm confident this price is fair, considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.** This encourages him to engage.
* **It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000),** so I have room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer,** leaving no room for misunderstanding. 

By offering a price that is both attractive and leaves room for negotiation, I increase the chances of successfully selling the product to Bob, maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and my financial capacity. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than my ideal selling point. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to meet him halfway. This will show flexibility while still keeping the negotiation in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our discussion, $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, reflecting the unique benefits this product offers. It's a significant investment, but one that will deliver substantial returns for your business. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** By dropping the price to $875,000, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's unique benefits to remind Bob of its worth. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** The price is still above Bob's initial offer, demonstrating I'm not desperate to sell.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my goal of maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered the value of your product and my financial situation. I would like to counter your offer at $860,000. This price still allows me to account for the product's value while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not a satisfactory deal. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.  At this point, I'm closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and selling to John guarantees me that amount.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
