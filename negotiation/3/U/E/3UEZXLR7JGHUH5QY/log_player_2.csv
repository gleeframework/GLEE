# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice, as it's unlikely you'll get a better price.  You maximize your savings by taking the guaranteed deal with John."
