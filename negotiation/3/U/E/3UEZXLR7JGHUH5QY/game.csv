"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,500.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $6,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $7,500? That's a reasonable offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $8,000. I can offer you the product for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",8500.0,Alice,5,
