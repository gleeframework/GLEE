Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price gives you some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Psychology:** Offering a very specific, odd number like $14,999 might make it seem like you've carefully considered the price and are serious about selling.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable potentially losing the sale to Bob if he rejects this initial offer. You could offer a lower price for a higher chance of a quick sale, but you'd risk leaving money on the table."
