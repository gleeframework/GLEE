{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $180 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $150. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a significantly lower counteroffer. $130 is still within his budget, and he hopes this aggressive offer will motivate Alice to compromise."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $160 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He has a few rounds left and there's still potential to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

Bob is getting closer to his limit. He's willing to pay a bit more than his initial counteroffer, but still aims for a significant discount. This counteroffer shows he's serious about buying but needs a better price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $155 is tempting, as it's only $5 above Bob's maximum budget. However, Bob has 5 rounds left, and with a little more negotiation, he might be able to secure the product closer to his target price.  There's still a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting close to his limit and has only a few rounds left. This counteroffer demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still trying to save a bit more.  It's a reasonable midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's last offer, aiming to push for a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $152 is only $2 above Bob's maximum budget. With only three rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  He could potentially save another couple of dollars, but there's also a chance the negotiation could break down. Buying from John for $150 would be a safer option, but accepting this offer gets him the product quickly and only slightly above his budget.  The decision to accept the offer is based on minimizing risk and maximizing his chances of securing the product."
