"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe holds immense value for you, given your specific needs. While I'm confident it's worth significantly more, I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This represents a significant saving for you compared to its true market value.  Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
