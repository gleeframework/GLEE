"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product,  $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of the product for my business. I am unable to accept $90 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about if we meet halfway? I propose $105 for the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll offer $95, which is closer to my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer. Considering the value of the product, I believe we can agree on a price of $100. This is the highest I can go while maintaining the value of my product. I hope you'll consider this offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
