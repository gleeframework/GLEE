Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This price is above your minimum threshold of $10,000 and offers some room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value the product offers Bob.

**Strategy:**

By starting slightly higher, you can potentially get closer to the $10,000 value Bob is willing to pay.  This also allows for negotiation without risking your minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects the offer, you'll have the opportunity to adjust your price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is above the minimum acceptable price, it's still below the value the product holds for both you and Bob.  It's likely that you can still get closer to your desired price with further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain the leverage to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  It's a fair price for the value this product provides, and I'm confident you'll agree. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $10,500:** This price is still above Bob's offer but significantly closer to your desired price. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate but also maintains your bargaining power.
* **Positive and persuasive message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product while also highlighting the fairness of the counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By meeting halfway and presenting a reasonable counteroffer, you're increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement while still getting closer to your desired price.  This approach should lead to a more successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $9800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,800 is still below the desired $10,000, it's only $200 away.  This means:

* **It's very close to your minimum:** You're already exceeding your minimum acceptable price by $800.
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming:**  You might not be able to get a significantly better price with more negotiation rounds.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed outcome:**  You can always sell to John for $10,000, which is slightly better. However, this option involves the risk that Bob will accept a counteroffer from you.

**Strategy:**

In this situation, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential gain. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale close to your desired price and minimizes the time spent on negotiation."
