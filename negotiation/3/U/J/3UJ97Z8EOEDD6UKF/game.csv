"Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far above my budget. Given my  valuation of the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  I'm open to further discussion, but this is my initial offer.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product's unique capabilities.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I'm trying to stay within my budget. While I acknowledge the product's value,  $1,900,000 is still a bit high. I'm prepared to go up to $1,500,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
