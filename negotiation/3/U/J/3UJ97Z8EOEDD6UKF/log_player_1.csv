"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  Beginning significantly above your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price sets a reference point. Even if Bob rejects it outright, his counteroffer is likely to be higher than if you started lower.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value is crucial, even at this high price.  
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** We lack information about Bob's negotiation style (aggressive, passive, etc.).  Future rounds will require adapting to his responses.
* **10 Round Limit:**  We need to make progress in each round, carefully balancing concessions with maximizing profit.
* **John's Offer:**  The $1,500,000 backup offer from John provides a safety net but shouldn't be rushed into."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far above my budget. Given my  valuation of the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  I'm open to further discussion, but this is my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is already above his stated valuation of $1,200,000. This indicates potential for negotiation towards a higher price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a significant gap between Bob's offer ($1,300,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **John as Backup:**  While selling to John is an option, it's too early to settle. We can likely negotiate a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In Round 3, we should counteroffer with a price significantly lower than our initial offer but still above both Bob's offer and your minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while aiming for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product's unique capabilities."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop but Above Target:** This counteroffer shows flexibility by dropping $400,000 from the initial price. However, it remains well above your $1,500,000 target and Bob's $1,300,000 offer.
* **Justification:** We continue to reinforce the product's value, justifying the higher price without sounding inflexible.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will reveal how serious Bob is and how much negotiating room exists."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm trying to stay within my budget. While I acknowledge the product's value,  $1,900,000 is still a bit high. I'm prepared to go up to $1,500,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches your absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong Position:** Bob increased his offer significantly and is now at his perceived limit. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are now in Round 4, and while we have time, there's no guarantee of a better outcome by continuing to negotiate, especially given Bob's firm stance in his message.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures the best possible outcome at this stage of the negotiation. It meets your minimum price and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation that might not yield a better result."
