"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me there?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $120. How about we meet at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate that. However, $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to think about my costs. How about we meet at $135?",135.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my bottom line. I can do $125, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make one more concession. I can do $130, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't meet there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,9,
