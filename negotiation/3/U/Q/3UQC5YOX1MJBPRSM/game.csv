"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great price for a product that's worth a lot to you.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're a tough negotiator!  How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us get this deal done.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $108? That's the lowest I can go.",108.0,Bob,6,
