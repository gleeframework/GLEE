"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $82.50?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $78? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to save a bit more money.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $78 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down a bit more, but let's meet in the middle at $80. That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
