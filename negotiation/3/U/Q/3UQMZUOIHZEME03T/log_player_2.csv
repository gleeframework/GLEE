"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product at a special price of $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While you're aiming to save the most money, Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly lower than John's $15,000.
* **Your value vs. Alice's:** The product is worth $15,000 to you and only $8,000 to Alice. This means there's a potential for negotiation, but Alice's offer is already within your acceptable range.

**Therefore, accepting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product for less than your maximum willingness to pay, saving you $3,000 compared to buying from John.**"
