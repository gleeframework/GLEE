"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the substantial benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is substantial, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Maintain a strong position:**  I've made a smaller concession than Bob's initial offer, signaling the value I place on the product.
* **Justification:** By referencing the ""true worth,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value beyond just his immediate budget.
* **Seeking middle ground:**  The counter-offer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $1,120,000 is beyond my current budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which suggests he's willing to negotiate. However, we are still significantly away from a price I find acceptable.  I'll counter-offer again, but I'm also becoming more open to John's offer if the gap doesn't close soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my genuine desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  We are past the halfway point in the negotiation, and I need to start applying pressure to reach a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Significant Movement:** I've made a more substantial concession this round to signal my strong interest in closing the deal with Bob. 
* **Final Offer Implication:** The tone suggests this might be one of my final offers before I seriously consider John's offer. This adds a sense of urgency for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $1,085,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $1,085,000 yields a profit of $85,000. Continuing to negotiate for smaller increments might not be worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now brings in the money sooner. Prolonging negotiations delays the potential use of those funds for other opportunities.
* **Relationship Building:**  Accepting Bob's offer, even with a smaller margin, shows a willingness to compromise and could lead to a positive future business relationship."
