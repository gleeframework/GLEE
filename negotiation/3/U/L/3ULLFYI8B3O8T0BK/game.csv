"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits and my budget. I'm open to further discussion.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise considering the product's potential benefits. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
