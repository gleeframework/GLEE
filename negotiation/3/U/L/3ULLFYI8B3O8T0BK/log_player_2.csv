"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it has immense potential to benefit your business and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good price, it's still a significant amount of money. Since I have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits and my budget. I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise considering the product's potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a good price.  While I could try to negotiate further, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a significantly better deal.  Plus, the longer I wait, the riskier it gets as I could end up buying from John for a higher price."
