"Bob, I believe this product has immense value for you, considering it's worth $1,500,000 in your hands. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000, a price that reflects its significant worth and provides a good margin for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $850,000? Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $850,000 is a considerable amount, it doesn't quite reflect the true value this product brings to your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which leaves a healthy profit margin for you while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $925,000?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
