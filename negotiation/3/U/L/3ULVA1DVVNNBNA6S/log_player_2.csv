Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to go to $13,200. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200.

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very stubbornly holding to a price above $13,000. It's unlikely she'll drop to $12,500 in the last round.  At this point, cutting your losses and securing the $10,000 deal with John is the most logical move to ensure you get the product at the best possible price."
