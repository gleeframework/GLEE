"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $70 for it.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $75. If you're not willing to go that low, I might have to look at other options.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $90. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $80 for it. It's a fair price for both of us and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to pay $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90, which would be $85. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,7,
