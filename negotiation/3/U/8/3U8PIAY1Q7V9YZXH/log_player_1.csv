Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $950,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000**, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000)**, incentivizing him to accept.
* **The message is friendly and confident**, setting a positive tone for the negotiation.

By starting high, you can potentially secure a better price while still leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, you can likely do better.  You're still significantly above your minimum acceptable price and have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm happy to accept $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could potentially continue to negotiate and try to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $925,000.  Accepting his offer ensures you get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
