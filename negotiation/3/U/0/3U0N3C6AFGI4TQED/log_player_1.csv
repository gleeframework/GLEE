Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that allows for negotiation. It's high enough to give me a good profit margin but not so high that Bob will immediately reject it.  I'm also leaving the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe Bob is willing to pay more, and I want to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great value for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
