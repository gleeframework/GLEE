Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John. This gives me room to negotiate downward.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The price is higher than Bob's perceived value, but not exorbitantly so. This makes it seem like a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This offer allows for a potential compromise between my floor price of $1,500,000 and Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 

I'm hoping this initial offer will make Bob feel like he can get a good deal if he negotiates. It's important to remember that the goal is to maximize my earnings, but also to keep the negotiation open and not scare Bob away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows that he is willing to negotiate.  There's still a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Potential to increase Bob's offer:** By rejecting his initial offer, I can counter with a more reasonable price, potentially pushing him closer to my desired range.

**Next Step:** I will counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This price is halfway between my initial offer of $1,750,000 and Bob's offer of $800,000. It signals a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While this counteroffer is lower than my initial price, it's still high enough to give me leverage in the negotiation. Bob is likely to have to increase his offer if he wants to secure the product.

By making this counteroffer, I aim to encourage further negotiation and potentially reach a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob continues to negotiate, demonstrating that he's interested in the product.  There's still potential to reach a more favorable price.
* **Potential to increase Bob's offer further:** By rejecting his offer, I can make another counteroffer. This might encourage Bob to increase his bid further, bringing us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Step:** I will counter with another price, aiming to bridge the gap between our offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer is a slight decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway. It also leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Closer to Bob's Value:**  The price is closer to Bob's perceived value, which may encourage him to increase his offer.
* **Maintaining Minimum:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't sell at a significant loss.

By making this counteroffer, I aim to find a compromise point that both Bob and I can agree on. I am confident that continued negotiation will lead to a successful outcome."
