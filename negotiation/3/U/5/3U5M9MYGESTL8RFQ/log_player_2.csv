"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I believe this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at her own maximum valuation. There's no room for you to save money in this scenario. Rejecting her offer opens up the possibility of a better deal, even if you ultimately end up buying from John at the same price."
