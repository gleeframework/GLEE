"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's make this deal happen!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $1300000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This represents a significant offer, and I'm sure we can reach a deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
