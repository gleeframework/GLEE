Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than that to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a decent sum, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $1300000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This represents a significant offer, and I'm sure we can reach a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can get closer to my target price. It's worth exploring if Bob is willing to come up a bit further, before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,000,000 still falls short of what I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1150000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer to $1,050,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm getting closer to John's offer of $1,200,000, but I'm not ready to sell to him yet.  There's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'm hoping that with continued dialogue, I can push him closer to my desired price point."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 still doesn't meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1075000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will meet my minimum price of $1,200,000.  While $1,075,000 is a decent offer, it's still too far below my minimum. To ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me the minimum value I require and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a lower price."
