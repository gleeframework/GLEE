"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1120000.

I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the point where I may need to consider other options. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1080000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
