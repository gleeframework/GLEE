"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $10000. Would you be willing to negotiate closer to this amount?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While $15000 is closer, I'm still unable to meet at that price point. I would like to propose $12000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
