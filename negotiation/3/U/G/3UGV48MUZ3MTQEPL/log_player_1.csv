Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $10000. Would you be willing to negotiate closer to this amount?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
