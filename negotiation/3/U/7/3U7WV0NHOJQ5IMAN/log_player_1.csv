{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a little below my minimum. How about we split the difference at $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm working with a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,900? That's a fair offer considering the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is still a bit low, but it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'd rather sell to him than to John, so I'll accept his offer and move on."
