"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your walk-away price and Alice's perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation.  I'll aim lower in the next round to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground. By starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her perceived value, it leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a price that's beneficial for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a little below my minimum. How about we split the difference at $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but $9,250 is still a significant markup from her perceived value of $8,000.  I'll continue negotiating, but I'll move slowly towards my target price to see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm working with a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,900? That's a fair offer considering the current market."",
""product_price"": 8900
}
``` 

This counter-offer strategically moves closer to Alice's offer while still aiming for a price closer to my target. Mentioning a ""tight budget"" and ""current market"" introduces external factors to justify the lower price."
