"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet closer to the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
