"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 undervalues its potential.  I could consider coming down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fairer offer that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
