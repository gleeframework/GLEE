"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for less than $14,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is still within your budget of $15,000 and is a better deal than buying from John.  Accepting this offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John."
