"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target budget of $15,000 as possible. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,500?  That still leaves you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget, so I'd like to try to get a bit closer. How about $13,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Bob,4,
