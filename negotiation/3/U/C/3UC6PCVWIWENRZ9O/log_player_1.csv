Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target budget of $15,000 as possible. Let me know what you think!

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,500 is too low, and I think I can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,500?  That still leaves you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget, so I'd like to try to get a bit closer. How about $13,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price, and I'm happy to accept it rather than risk losing the deal altogether or settling for the lower price from John."
