"Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product Alice, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 is still too far from what I can accept.  Let's compromise at $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the closest I can go.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
