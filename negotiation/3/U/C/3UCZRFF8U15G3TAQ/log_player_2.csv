# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something I value at $80, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a discounted price.  Would you be interested in paying $90 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

We can do better than $90! Let's see if Alice will offer a lower price. If not, we can always buy from John for $100."
