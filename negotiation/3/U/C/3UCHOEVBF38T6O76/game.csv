"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this strikes a fair balance between the product's worth to me and the price you're asking. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is a good offer, I was hoping to get closer to the product's true value to me. Considering the product's worth to me is $1200000, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. As I mentioned earlier, the product's worth to me is $1200000, and I'm not willing to compromise further. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: I'll sell the product to you for $1075000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.
