"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm going to have to pass on $1,300,000.  It's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm happy to continue the conversation if you're willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,000,000? That would leave us both with some wiggle room.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal. While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, this product offers you a unique opportunity for even greater returns.  I could come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a mutually beneficial point, don't you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to find something closer to $1,100,000.  I'm confident this product has a lot of potential, and I think this price would be a fair and beneficial agreement for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
