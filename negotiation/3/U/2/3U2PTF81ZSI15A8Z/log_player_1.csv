Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm going to have to pass on $1,300,000.  It's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm happy to continue the conversation if you're willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,000,000? That would leave us both with some wiggle room. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, this product offers you a unique opportunity for even greater returns.  I could come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a mutually beneficial point, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to find something closer to $1,100,000.  I'm confident this product has a lot of potential, and I think this price would be a fair and beneficial agreement for both of us.
