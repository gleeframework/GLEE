"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers.  I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price. To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  Therefore, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. Let me know if this works for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
