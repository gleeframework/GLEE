Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
