# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. My starting price is $2,000,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable return on my investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me to sell this product. It's a valuable asset with significant potential, and I'm confident it can be a major asset to your business. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,500,000, which is still a reasonable price considering the product's value. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while, and I appreciate your efforts. However, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise one last time and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $1,200,000.  While we could try one more counteroffer, it's risky.  Alice might be firm on her ""final offer,"" and we'd be forced to accept or lose the deal.  Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees the best price and avoids further negotiation risk."
