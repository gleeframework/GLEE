"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and can greatly benefit you.  Given its unique qualities, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,400,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, given its potential value to me. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and we can finalize the deal quickly.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to gain from this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
