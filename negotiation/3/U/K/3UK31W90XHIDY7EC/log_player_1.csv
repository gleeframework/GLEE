Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $20,000 sets a high starting point. This allows for room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly indicates a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has some power in the process.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the product being ""amazing"" and ""you'd be very interested in"" subtly hints at its value, without revealing too much about my personal valuation.

**Strategy:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:**  Bob's initial reaction will tell me a lot about his perceived value of the product. If he rejects, his counteroffer will give me a stronger indication of his maximum price.
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** I am willing to go down in price, but I will not go below my minimum of $15,000.  
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will pay $15,000 provides a backup plan and gives me confidence to push for a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $15000 for it. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Budget:** Bob clearly stated his budget limit of $15,000.  Trying to negotiate further is unlikely to be successful.
* **No Upside:**  I have no reason to believe I can get more than $15,000 from Bob.  He has set his limit, and any counteroffer will likely lead to a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale with no risk. While I would ideally get more, it's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 than potentially lose out on the sale and end up with nothing. 

**Outcome:** Selling to Bob at his price is the most rational decision in this situation."
