"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to bridge the gap, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to start at $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's try $1,050,000. This feels like a good middle ground for both of us.  I'm confident that we can close this deal with this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit that's worth my while. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement. If we can't meet in the middle, I'll have to consider other options. Let's try one more time at $1,075,000. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
