Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal. If you ask for too much, he might walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Considering its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Strong Price:** $1,400,000 is a significant gain for you ($200,000 over your minimum) and still a good deal for Bob (saving him $100,000).
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to decide quickly. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust within reason, but remember your bottom line.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Don't be afraid to walk away from Bob's offer if it's too low. You have a guaranteed sale with John."
