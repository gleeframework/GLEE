"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $180 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $140.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $160 is still a bit high for me.  How about $155? That's a fair price that's closer to my budget.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is a good price for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $157.50. It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, $157.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $156.25.  This is a fair price that leaves us both with a bit of room to maneuver.",156.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $156.25 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $158. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",158.0,Alice,7,
