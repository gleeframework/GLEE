"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to maximize my potential profit.  I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I'm leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a good deal.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to settle for the lowest possible price just yet. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $900,000.  This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price. I believe this is a fair offer, and it should encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  $850,000 is a good deal and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially losing the deal.  I'm confident that I can secure a good profit at this price."
