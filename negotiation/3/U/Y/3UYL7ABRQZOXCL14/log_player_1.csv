"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is higher than my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start high, but I'm aware that I might need to come down to secure a deal, especially since I have a backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my goal. Since I have a backup offer from John, I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum value. It's a significant step towards Bob's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to sell to him to avoid potentially going through more rounds, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price. I'm also considering the possibility that he might be willing to go higher if I continue to reject his offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm further lowering my price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant move, showing my willingness to compromise and potentially getting closer to a deal.  It's still above my minimum value, but I'm feeling the pressure to make a deal as we are already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely need to consider selling to John to avoid losing out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum value, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob, especially with the time constraint.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my desired minimum profit and avoids the risk of getting a worse deal with Bob."
