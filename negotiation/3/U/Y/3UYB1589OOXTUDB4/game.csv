"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $90? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $105. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $107.50. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",107.5,Alice,5,
