"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to drop the price to $13,500.  This is my final offer before I consider selling to John.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we need to find a compromise here.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $12,500.  That's the best I can do.",12500.0,Bob,6,
