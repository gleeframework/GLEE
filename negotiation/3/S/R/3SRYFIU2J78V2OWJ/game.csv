This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that offers significant savings compared to its intrinsic value of $8000 to you. Let's work together to make this transaction beneficial for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $10000. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, which is the price John is offering. I'm willing to make a compromise, so I'll meet you in the middle at $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
