"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $10000. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, which is the price John is offering. I'm willing to make a compromise, so I'll meet you in the middle at $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
