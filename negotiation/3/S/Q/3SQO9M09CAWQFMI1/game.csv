"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product of this caliber, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and discuss a price closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still below the value I place on this product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway again, at $1,200,000. This price acknowledges both the product's worth and your budget.  Let's aim for a quick agreement so we can move forward.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a sweet spot at $1,050,000. This price takes into account the product's value, but also my budget constraints. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
