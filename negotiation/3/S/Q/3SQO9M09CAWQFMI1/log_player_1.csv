Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product of this caliber, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and discuss a price closer to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
