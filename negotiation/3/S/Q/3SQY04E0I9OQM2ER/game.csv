"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interests.  While I see the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would leave us both with a good profit margin. Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product to you is significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,125,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,087,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1087500.0,Bob,4,
