Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher than the asking price, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and uses phrases like ""What do you think?"" to invite a counter-offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your absolute minimum is $8,000, but aiming higher initially can lead to a more profitable outcome."
