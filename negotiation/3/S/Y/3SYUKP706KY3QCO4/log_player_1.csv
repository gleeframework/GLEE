"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but lower than my minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation, and allows me to see if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum.  It's worth exploring if I can get a bit more, but I'm not desperate enough to accept that low price yet.  I'll counter and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low right now. How about $15,500? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at a price that's closer to my minimum and still leaves room for negotiation. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I don't want to sell at a loss. While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'd prefer to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  There's still room for compromise, and I want to exhaust all options before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to make this deal work, but $13,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This is a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum price, but showing some flexibility by coming down a bit. I'm emphasizing that I want to close the deal and that I believe this is a good price for both of us. This adds pressure on Bob and might lead him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are now at the 6th round and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I've exhausted my negotiation options with Bob, and while I'd prefer to sell to him for a better price, it's clear that he's not willing to meet my minimum. 

Therefore, to avoid losing any more time and ensure I get a price that meets my minimum, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
