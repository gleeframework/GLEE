,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is very generous, but I'm looking to spend less than $1,000,000 on this product. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer,  $1,100,000 is considerably below my bottom line. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to compromise is appreciated, and $1,400,000 is getting closer. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,650,000. This price reflects the exceptional value of the product while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal.  Let's make this happen.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,650,000 is a good step, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
