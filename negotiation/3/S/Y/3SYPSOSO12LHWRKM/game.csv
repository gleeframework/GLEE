"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1075000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $975000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1000000, which would be $1050000. I'm willing to pay this price, but if not, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
