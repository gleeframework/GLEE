"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I need to make a profit, hoping to incentivize Bob to negotiate.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to sell, I can't accept a price below my minimum. I'll reject and counteroffer, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering the minimum price I'm willing to accept.  This price is fair to both of us and allows me to reach my desired profit.  I hope Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject and counteroffer again. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway.  I'm keeping a close eye on John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show some flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  I think this is a good compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept. I'm  making a small profit and can avoid the hassle of further negotiation."
