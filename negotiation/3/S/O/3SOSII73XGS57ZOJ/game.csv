"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you and still well above what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to work with you, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant concession. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $975,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
