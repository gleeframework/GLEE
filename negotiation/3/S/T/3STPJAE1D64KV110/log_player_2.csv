"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500.  It's worth at least that much to me, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount because I value our potential relationship.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice is offering a slight discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a lower price, achieving his goal."
