Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product, as I know it would be valuable to you.  I think a price of $14,000 is fair for both of us. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows for some back and forth if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** $14,000 is significantly more than John's offer of $12,000, ensuring a profitable outcome even if Bob tries to negotiate down."
