Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you.

Alice's offer is still higher than your budget, but it's a lot closer. You can try to negotiate a lower price, but if you can't get it down to your budget, you can always buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,550,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $1,525,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
