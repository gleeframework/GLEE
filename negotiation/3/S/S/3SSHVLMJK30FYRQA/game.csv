"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,600,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,400,000? I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price point.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,550,000 is still a bit above my ideal price point.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,525,000? I'm confident we can reach a final agreement that benefits both of us.",1525000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,550,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $1,525,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1525500.0,Alice,5,
