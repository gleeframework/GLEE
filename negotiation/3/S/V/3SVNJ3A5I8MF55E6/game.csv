"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,400,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,350,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,375,000, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the discount I'm offering you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
