"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,90.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $90. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $90 is still a little steeper than I'd like. How about $70? That's a fair compromise, I think.",70.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,85.0
"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $85. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",85.0,Alice,5,,
