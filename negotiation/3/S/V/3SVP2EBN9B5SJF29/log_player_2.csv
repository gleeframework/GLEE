Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $85. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.

While Alice is getting closer to my price range, her ""final offer"" of $85 is still more than John's offer of $80. It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and get the best price."
