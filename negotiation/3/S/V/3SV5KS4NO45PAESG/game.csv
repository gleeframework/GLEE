,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.  Let's make this happen!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can we meet at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle for $825,000? This is a fair compromise, and it would still be a great deal for both of us. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go above $775,000, and I'm starting to think that buying from John for $800,000 might be the better option. Can you meet me at $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,
