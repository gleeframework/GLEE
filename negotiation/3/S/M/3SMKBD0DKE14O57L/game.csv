"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
