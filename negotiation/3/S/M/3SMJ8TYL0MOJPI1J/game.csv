,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to buy it for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $130 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. How about $125? That would be a good middle ground for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it then.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $128. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair deal. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $128 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying, but I'm willing to meet you at $122. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. What do you say?",122.0,Bob,6,
