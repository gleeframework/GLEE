"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has a better alternative in John.  The next step is to make a counteroffer to Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for this product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,000 is closer to his target, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can get the same product from John for $10,000.  The next step is to make another counteroffer to Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for this product, as I'm confident it's worth it.  This is my final offer, so let me know if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is still a great deal for you. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's final offer of $11,250 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  At this point, it's better to go with the guaranteed price from John, even though it means missing out on the potential deal with Alice."
