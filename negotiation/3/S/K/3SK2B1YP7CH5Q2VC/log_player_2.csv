"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and definitely worth the price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  $140 is close to your maximum, but there's still room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $135? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down from her original price, and $135 is still within my budget. It's a good deal for me, so I'll take it."
