Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price closer to Bob's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's still below the value I'd like to get for the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a significant profit for me. It also sets the stage for further potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $950,000 is a good deal considering the risk of continuing negotiations and the possibility of Bob walking away entirely.  Selling to John for $800,000 would be less profitable, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
