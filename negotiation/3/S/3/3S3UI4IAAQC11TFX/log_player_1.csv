Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** Since you know the product is worth $120 to Bob, starting at $115 is close enough to his perceived value to be attractive while still leaving you room to potentially earn more than your minimum.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100 gives you leverage. You don't have to accept an offer below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is tempting, it's still below your target.  You started high, so it's reasonable to expect some negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer. You can then propose a counteroffer closer to a mutually beneficial price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price of $110, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. This keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Maintaining Value:** You're still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum ($100) and closer to Bob's perceived value ($120). 
* **Pressure:** This counteroffer puts a bit of pressure on Bob. He now knows your starting point and your desired compromise. If he truly values the product, he's more likely to accept a price closer to this point than risk you walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about $107? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to negotiate a good deal for himself, but his offer of $107 is now getting close to your target price.  Here's why accepting is a good move:

* **Profitable:** $107 is a $7 profit over your minimum acceptable price, which is a good return.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or even walking away. The potential gain from squeezing out a few more dollars is outweighed by the risk of losing the sale entirely.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting now allows you to move on to other potential deals."
