Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $150 but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is interested in the product at a price that's still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'd love to make a quick sale, Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. I hope this encourages Bob to continue the negotiation and leads to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is closer to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John for $150. I'll accept his offer to secure a profitable sale."
