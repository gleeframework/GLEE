"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise that still allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
