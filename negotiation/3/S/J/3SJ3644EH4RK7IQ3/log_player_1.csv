Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below my minimum ($12,000).
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a strong offer close to $12,000  increases the chances of Bob accepting. While it's a gamble, it's a calculated one to potentially gain an extra $1,999 in profit. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob and ensuring a sale at my desired minimum."
