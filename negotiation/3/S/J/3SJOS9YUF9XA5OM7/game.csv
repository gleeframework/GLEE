,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about $10,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $9,500.  Would that be agreeable to you?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750?  This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal quickly.",9750.0,Alice,5,
