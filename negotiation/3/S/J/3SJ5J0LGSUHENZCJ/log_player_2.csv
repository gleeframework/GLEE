It's better to reject Alice's offer. It's way above your budget, and you can likely get a better deal by counteroffering or buying from John."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.  We'll see if Alice is willing to come down that much."
