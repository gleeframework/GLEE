Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12,800. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I've already discounted the price significantly, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,400, which is just $400 more than your offer. This is the best I can do. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.

Alice is signaling that she's getting close to her limit. While we could try for a lower price, it's unlikely we'd get much further and we risk her withdrawing the offer entirely.  $12,400 is a reasonable compromise and a good deal compared to John's $15,000."
