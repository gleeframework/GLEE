"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize you see the value in this product, my initial pricing reflects its true worth and potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,200,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your latest offer is a significant step away from where I see the value of this product. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal quickly. If you accept a price of $1,450,000, we have an agreement. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer, but I think we're getting close. I'll counter with $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
