"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true worth while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
