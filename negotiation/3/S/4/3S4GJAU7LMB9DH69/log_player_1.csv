Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Considering its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but offering that price to Bob will likely lead to rejection.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other potential buyers, Alice encourages Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This strategy balances Alice's desire for maximum profit with the need to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
