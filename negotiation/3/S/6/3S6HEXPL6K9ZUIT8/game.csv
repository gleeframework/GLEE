"I'm excited to offer you the product for $15,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $12,000 to me, and I'm willing to negotiate to make it work for you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me partway, Alice. How about we try $7,500?  That feels more reasonable to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $9,500? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to work with you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $9,500 is still more than I'm able to spend. My absolute best offer is $7,800.  If you can't do that, I'll unfortunately need to pass this time.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,800. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
