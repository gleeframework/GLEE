Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation helps, starting the negotiation significantly above his perceived value leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the high price (""unique features"", ""potential"") makes it seem less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests willingness to discuss the price further.

**Goal:**  Ideally, this approach aims to secure a deal close to $1,100,000. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice has a strong fallback with John at $1,200,000, ensuring she never sells below her minimum."
