"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,800. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9800.0,Alice,5,
