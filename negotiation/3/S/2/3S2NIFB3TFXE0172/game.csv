"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $15,000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
