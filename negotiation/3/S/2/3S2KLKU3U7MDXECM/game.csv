"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm happy to start the conversation at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested, but I would only be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of reach for me. Would you consider $7,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate your position, but $7,000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind. To be fair to us both, how about we settle at $8,500? That's a significant compromise on my end.",8500.0,Alice,5,
