"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm happy to start the conversation at $12,000. What do you think?

You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested, but I would only be willing to pay around $6,000 for it."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This feels like a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of reach for me. Would you consider $7,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate your position, but $7,000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind. To be fair to us both, how about we settle at $8,500? That's a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go down to $8,000. She's already compromising, and you have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. It's better to secure the deal with John now than risk Alice not budging further."
