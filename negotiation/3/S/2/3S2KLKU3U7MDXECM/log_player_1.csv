Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm happy to start the conversation at $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested, but I would only be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of reach for me. Would you consider $7,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate your position, but $7,000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind.
