"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What do you think?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique capabilities that would be highly beneficial for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try to find a compromise at $800,000? This is a fair offer considering my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $800,000 is still below what I had in mind, I understand your budget constraints. Let's find a middle ground:  How about $1,550,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value this product brings.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we need to find a middle ground. While I appreciate your movement, I'm afraid $1,550,000 is still out of my reach. How about $950,000? I believe this demonstrates my seriousness about the purchase while reflecting a more realistic price point.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal. I understand that finding the right price is important for both of us. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise, recognizing both the product's inherent value and your budgetary considerations.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thanks for your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite a bit apart. I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I've tried to be flexible, but the value of this product is substantial. This is my final offer - $1,150,000.  This price represents a significant concession on my part to get this deal done.",1150000.0,Alice,9,
