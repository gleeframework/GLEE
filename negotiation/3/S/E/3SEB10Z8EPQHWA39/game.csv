"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
