"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, considering it's worth $8,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value. I'll reject and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him in the remaining rounds. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell to him."
