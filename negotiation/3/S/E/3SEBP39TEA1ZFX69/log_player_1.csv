"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at my minimum price, allowing for potential compromises. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price within the 10 rounds. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer is low, he has demonstrated interest and is willing to pay a premium. This suggests there is room for negotiation.
* **Protecting my value:** Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss, while rejecting it allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and keep the option of selling to John if negotiations fail."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
