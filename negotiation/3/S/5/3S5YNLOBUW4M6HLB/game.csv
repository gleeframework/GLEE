"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $130 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $140? This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $140 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $155.  This is a reasonable price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's try to close this deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $140. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",140.0,Bob,6,
