"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $130 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still a bit high. Bob should try to get the price down further before considering accepting.  He can continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $140? This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $140 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $155.  This is a reasonable price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial price, it's still above Bob's limit of $120. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price from Alice. If it looks like Alice won't budge, then Bob should consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $140. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
