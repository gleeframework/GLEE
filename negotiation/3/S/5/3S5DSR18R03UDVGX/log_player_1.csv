Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $145.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you aim to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing a profit for you.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price makes it seem like Bob is getting a deal without significantly impacting your potential earnings."
