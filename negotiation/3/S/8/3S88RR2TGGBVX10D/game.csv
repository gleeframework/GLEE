Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1300000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1500000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1400000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $1250000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone as low as I can go. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1400000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price. I'm not going to compromise further.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
