Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $14,000. This would be a good deal for both of us - I get the product at a reasonable price, and you get a quick sale.
