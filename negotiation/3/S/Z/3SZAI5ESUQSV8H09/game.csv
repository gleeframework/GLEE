"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is out of my budget. I'm very interested in this product and would like to offer $1,300,000.  This is my best offer, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about what's fair for both of us. I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
