"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, given its value to me. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider something closer to $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
