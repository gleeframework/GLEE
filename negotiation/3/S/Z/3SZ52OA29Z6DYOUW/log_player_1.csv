Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, given its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider something closer to $13,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk Bob walking away."
