Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will tell you a lot about how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.  
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer at $15,000. This knowledge gives you leverage and confidence in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is a good offer, it's still below my initial ask.  Bob's willingness to negotiate means there might be room to meet somewhere in the middle. I'll try to counter closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I had a higher price in mind, I'm willing to be flexible. Could you meet me at $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer aims to find a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** By coming down slightly, I demonstrate to Bob that I'm open to negotiation, which encourages him to continue the discussion.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price point still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Could you consider meeting me at $17,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $17,500 is a strong offer and a reasonable compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly more than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate could result in Bob walking away or getting stuck at an even lower price. Accepting now guarantees a good profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now also means I receive the payment sooner, which is always a plus in business."
