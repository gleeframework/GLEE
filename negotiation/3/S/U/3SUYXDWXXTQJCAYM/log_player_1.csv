"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value, but not drastically so. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value and deal aspect, hoping to make Bob more inclined to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message doesn't close the door to negotiation, allowing Bob to feel comfortable making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does show his interest.  This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my commitment to my price point and encourages him to come closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Within Range:** My counter-offer of $125 is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while keeping my profit margin.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the ""good deal"" aspect, reminding Bob that $125 is still a good value for the product. 
* **Building Rapport:** I use a more conversational tone (""I appreciate your interest"", ""How about"") to maintain a positive relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price, and it would allow me to get the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is Valuable:** We're already in round 4, and I've already made concessions. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a much more secure and profitable option compared to the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob. 

By selling to John, I guarantee myself a profit and avoid the uncertainty of further rounds of negotiations with Bob."
