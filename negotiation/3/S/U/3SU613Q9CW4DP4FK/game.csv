"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,150?  I'm really hoping to make this deal work, and I believe this price is fair to both of us.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go any higher than $9,800, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference one more time. How about $10,250?  I believe this would be a fair and final price that we can both agree on.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider other options.",9800.0,Bob,8,
