"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  A $12,000 offer gives Bob enough space to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message helps build a good relationship with Bob. 
* **Highlight Value:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's worth, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly less than my minimum desired price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Exploring Options:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to explore further negotiation before resorting to selling to John.
* **Time Remaining:**  With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to see if a better deal can be reached with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price lower than my original offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  I frame the offer as a good deal for both of us, emphasizing the potential for a win-win scenario.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging, avoiding any harsh language that could hinder further negotiation.
* **Strategic Price Point:**  $10,500 is a relatively strategic price. It's closer to my desired price point, and it leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's still a chance that Bob might increase his offer with further negotiation.
* **Time Remaining:**  With 6 rounds left, I have time to explore if a better deal can be reached with Bob.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John at this point would be more profitable, but I'm not willing to abandon the negotiation with Bob just yet. There's a chance I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,150?  I'm really hoping to make this deal work, and I believe this price is fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that is closer to his last offer while still maintaining a higher profit margin for myself.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I frame the offer as fair to both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of equity and potentially making him more inclined to accept.
* **Emphasis on Closing the Deal:**  I express my desire to reach an agreement, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to reconsider his offer.
* **Strategic Price Point:** $10,150 is a strategic price point. It's higher than Bob's last offer but significantly lower than my minimum price. This leaves room for further negotiation, if needed, while still ensuring a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any higher than $9,800, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Even though Bob's offer has increased, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Still Possible:** There's still some room for negotiation. With 4 rounds remaining, I have time to try and reach a better price.
* **Avoiding Loss:** While selling to John would be a profitable decision at this point, I'm not willing to abandon the negotiation with Bob just yet. I believe I can potentially get closer to my ideal price.
* **Strategic Approach:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially increase the price further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference one more time. How about $10,250?  I believe this would be a fair and final price that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet him halfway. This demonstrates flexibility and could increase his likelihood of accepting.
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting this as a final price, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I continue to frame the offer as fair to both of us, using language that emphasizes mutual benefit. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:** While $10,250 is significantly less than my desired price of $15,000, it's still a profitable deal for me.  It also keeps the negotiation moving toward a potential closing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 2 rounds remaining, the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-consuming. 
* **Little Room for Improvement:**  Bob's offer has barely budged, and he's expressing frustration.  There's a low probability that he'll offer a significantly higher price.
* **Significant Loss:**  Accepting $9,800 would result in a substantial loss compared to selling to John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum desired price. It's a safe and predictable outcome.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high. It's more sensible to secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
