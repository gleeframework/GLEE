{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize profit while also leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept an offer that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $70 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $78 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get a little closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $78 is still a bit low for me.  Would you consider $82? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82}
