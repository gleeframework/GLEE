Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob if he finds this offer too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.  This should be more appealing to Bob while still reflecting the value I place on the product."
