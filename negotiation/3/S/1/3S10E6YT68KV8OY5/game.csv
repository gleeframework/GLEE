"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. Can you consider that?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value I've attached to this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1200000, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $900000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still hesitant, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the value I've attached to this product, I'm willing to make a slight concession. My counteroffer is $1100000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,6,
