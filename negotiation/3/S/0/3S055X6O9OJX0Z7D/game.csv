"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity. I believe it's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your purchase.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $900000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. I'm prepared to offer $800000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to purchase from John.",800000.0,Bob,4,
