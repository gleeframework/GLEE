"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer represents a significant profit for me while still offering a good deal to Bob, allowing for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good profit, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,050,000? This would still represent a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $975,000? That would make it much easier for me to say yes. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is a good amount, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer Bob again, hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  I'm confident this is a good investment for you, and I'm willing to work with you to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the effort you're putting into this negotiation. How about $985,000? That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I need to be pragmatic. $985,000 is a strong offer and very close to my desired price point.  It's risky to keep negotiating, as I might not get a better offer, and I risk losing the deal completely.  It's time to accept and move on."
