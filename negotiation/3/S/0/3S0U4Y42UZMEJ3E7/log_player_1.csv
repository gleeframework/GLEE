Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message subtly implies the product is worth more than Bob might think, potentially swaying him.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer, but this approach aims to get you the best possible price."
