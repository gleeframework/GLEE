Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially meet in the middle.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging tone might make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message clearly implies I'm open to negotiating, which could lead to a successful deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and try to negotiate a price that's acceptable to both of us.
* If we can't reach an agreement, I'll consider selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.** While it's closer to my minimum, it's not enough to make me consider selling at this point. 
* **I'm confident I can get a better price.** Bob is interested and has shown a willingness to negotiate. I believe I can push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while still keeping negotiations open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $90 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105? That's a good compromise and still within a reasonable range for me."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being higher than his initial offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly tone, encouraging continued negotiation.
* **Reasonable Justification:**  I've provided a reason for my counteroffer (""good compromise"" and ""reasonable range"") which might make Bob more receptive.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $100? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I really like the product and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.** While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Continued negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.**  Bob has shown a strong desire for the product but is reluctant to go higher.  Further negotiation could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a stalemate. 
* **Selling to John guarantees $150, but there's a chance of getting closer to that with Bob.**  While $100 is less than John's offer, there's a chance that continuing to negotiate could ultimately get me a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $100.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's a good deal considering the circumstances and Bob's clear interest in the product."
