"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're willing to let it go for $140. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. There's no rush to buy from John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That product looks great, but I was hoping to spend closer to $110 for it. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($110 vs. $140) leaves room for negotiation. It also gives us a sense of Alice's flexibility on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $125. This still allows for a good savings compared to the original price, while ensuring we maintain a fair value for our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to our desired price, which is encouraging. However, there's still room for negotiation before we reach the $110 mark. Let's see if we can nudge her further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $117?  That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 117
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're inching closer to a potential deal. By suggesting $117, we split the difference between her last offer ($125) and ours ($110). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your position and I am willing to consider it. Based on this, I propose a price of $120 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $120, which is a reasonable price and a $30 savings from her original offer. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  This seems like a good point to accept."
