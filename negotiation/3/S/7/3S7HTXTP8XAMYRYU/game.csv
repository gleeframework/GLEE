"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,100,000 just yet. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.
