"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $17,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but that price is still a bit high for me. I could do $13,000.  That's a very competitive offer considering John is willing to sell a similar product for $8,000.",13000.0,Bob,6,
