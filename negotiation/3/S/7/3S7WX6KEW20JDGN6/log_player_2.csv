"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, it's always good to try and negotiate a lower price. Since you have 10 rounds, there's room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. A $20 reduction is a reasonable starting point, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still a bit high for my liking. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal.  There are still several rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while also indicating that I believe the product is worth less than $110.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my target. Even though we're running out of rounds, I'm not ready to concede.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at $110. This is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer. It's still within my budget, and there's a good chance Alice will accept, given the limited rounds remaining. If she rejects, I'll have to decide between buying from John or ending the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my target price. With only three rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is high. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product for a price within my budget, rather than risk being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
