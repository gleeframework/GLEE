"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000?  I believe that's a fair price given its value to me.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is simply too low.  I understand your perspective, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about $9,000? This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $6,500? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $6,500 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
