Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $6,500 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

It's not worth continuing negotiations with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower than $8,500, and you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  Cut your losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
