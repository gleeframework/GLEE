"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth it to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This gives him a little room to negotiate, while still allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, so I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $15,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, and it's very close to my desired price.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
