Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a fairer price. Considering its worth to me, I would like to propose a price of $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $950,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves you a good profit margin while allowing me to get closer to my target price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price of $1050000. This allows us to stay within a reasonable range for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob, or I can always sell to John if the negotiations fall through.  I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a price of $1060000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise that gives me a profit of $60,000 over John's offer.  It's also the best I'm likely to get from Bob, as I've only got 4 rounds left and I'm unlikely to get a higher price from him in that time."
