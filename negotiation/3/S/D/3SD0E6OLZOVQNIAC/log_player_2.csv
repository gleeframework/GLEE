Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a substantial amount, but leaves room for potential compromise and gives me a strong starting point."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my ideal price point. While this offer is closer to my maximum budget, I have time and rounds to negotiate further, and potentially get a better price.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

Alice's offer was closer to my target, but still a bit high. This counteroffer increases my previous offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while still remaining within my budget constraints.  It's a reasonable midpoint that could potentially encourage a deal in the next round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still within my rounds and have room to negotiate. I'm not willing to pay above $1 million, so I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
