"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it gives me a reasonable return. Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that and $1,050,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $1,000,000. This is the best I can do, as I'm also considering another buyer who is willing to pay this price.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're considering another buyer, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. That's the best I can do. Can you consider this offer?",980000.0,Bob,6,
