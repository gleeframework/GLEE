Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering the product at $100, which is above Bob's value of $80 but below my minimum value of $120. This leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a decent profit.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By starting at a price slightly above Bob's value, I encourage him to counter-offer, allowing for a potential increase in price. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations and not settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I know I can get $120 from John, so I have leverage.
* **Counter-offer strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price, potentially leading to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100 for this product.  Would you consider a price of $95? This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product and framing $95 as a fair compromise. 

By offering $95, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for negotiation:**  Bob has stuck to his offer of $90, which is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time, especially since I know I can get $120 from John.
* **Guarantee profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids the potential of further negotiation with Bob that could lead to an even lower price. 

While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, securing the guaranteed profit with John is the most sensible choice at this point."
