"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my price range. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that's lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to find a compromise. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $850,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
