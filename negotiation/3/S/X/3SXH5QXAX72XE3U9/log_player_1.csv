Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, which I value at over $1,000,000.  I'm confident it will be of great value to you.  My starting price is $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I expect to get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  He clearly sees the value of the product and is willing to negotiate.  There are still 9 rounds left, which gives me time to explore better options.  Selling to John would leave me with a loss compared to what I believe I can achieve with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still reflects the significant value this product holds.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I expect to get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd still prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a good deal.  Bob is showing he's willing to negotiate, and I've already dropped significantly from my initial offer.  Accepting this offer means I'll secure a good profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to lower prices or a stalemate.  It's also significantly better than the $1,000,000 I'd get from John."
