"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which still reflects the significant value this product holds.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
