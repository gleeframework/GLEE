"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000, which is still a good deal considering its value to me. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
