"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to make the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open for as long as possible. By starting high, I can potentially secure a higher price. However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go above $9,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he's shown some willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **I want to explore further negotiation.** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating with him.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target. However, I'm also keeping the option to sell to John for $15,000 in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a compromise. 
* **Focus on benefits:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us, highlighting the ""good deal"" aspect.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us.  By offering a compromise, I'm increasing the chances of a successful negotiation. I'm also keeping in mind that I can still sell to John for $15,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to keep the price under $9,000. How about we settle on $9,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he's coming up slightly from his previous offer, $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **I want to continue negotiating.** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer further, especially since he's shown a willingness to compromise.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to my target. I'm still aware that I can sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out, but I want to explore all options before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still below my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle again, at $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle (again):** I'm continuing to use the ""meeting in the middle"" strategy, as it shows a willingness to compromise. This time, the price is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth by stating that he'll find it ""worth every penny.""
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that both Bob and I can agree on. While $10,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in this compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of negotiating room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.  I really want to work with you, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he's shown some flexibility, $9,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **I want to push for a better deal.** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially since he's stated that he ""really wants to work with me.""

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to my target. However, I'm also aware that I'm running out of negotiating rounds. If Bob doesn't increase his offer significantly in the next round, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too far from my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, at $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the value you'll receive from this product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to seriously consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering the same price as the previous round. This demonstrates a strong commitment to finding a solution while also maintaining my minimum price point.
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable, and that he'll be happy with it at this price.
* **Highlighting consequences:** I'm subtly mentioning that if he doesn't agree, I'll have to consider selling to John, which could be seen as a slight threat.

**Strategy:**

This is a high-stakes round. I'm taking a stand by sticking to my price, hoping Bob will see the value and agree.  If he rejects, I'll likely have to sell to John in the next round."
