"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go above $9,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would give us both a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to keep the price under $9,000. How about we settle on $9,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still below my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle again, at $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product to be worth every penny.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.  I really want to work with you, but I need to stay within my budget.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too far from my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, at $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the value you'll receive from this product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to seriously consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
