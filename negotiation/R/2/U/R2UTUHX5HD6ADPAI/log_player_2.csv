"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This item holds immense value to us, but its worth to you is even greater. After careful consideration and assessment of its true worth, I propose to sell it to you for $950,000. This price reflects not only the product's intrinsic value but also acknowledges the importance you place on it. I believe this offer presents a fair compromise that respects both the value we place on the product and the significant benefit it would bring to you. I look forward to your positive response and the chance to facilitate this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and open the door for a counter-offer."
