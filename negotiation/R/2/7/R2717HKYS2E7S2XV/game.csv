"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500 for the product. Is this something you'd like to consider?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for me right now. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for the product. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $7,000, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,250. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $8,250 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one? I'd be willing to pay $7,625.",7625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000. That's the minimum I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to be at least at this level. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
