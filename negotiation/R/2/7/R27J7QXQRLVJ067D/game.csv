,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $125 for this product.  Let's try to find some common ground.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I can do $165, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This product is really worth more than that, but I'm willing to compromise to make a sale. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $125.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Bob,6,
