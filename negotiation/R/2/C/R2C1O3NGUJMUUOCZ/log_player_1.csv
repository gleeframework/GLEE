"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $1,000,000 is a significant drop. While I'm eager to find an agreement, the value this product brings is undeniable. Could you consider $1,175,000? This demonstrates movement on my end while acknowledging the product's worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $1,087,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is systematically negotiating down, always meeting in the middle. While $1,087,500 is a good profit, we're still early in the negotiation. Holding firm now might encourage him to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I respect your approach. Let's consider this: $1,125,000. This reflects my commitment to finding common ground while valuing what the product brings to the table."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show respect, but hold firm:** Acknowledging Bob's negotiating skills helps maintain a positive tone, but we're not budging significantly.
* **Strategic concession:** The offer is a smaller concession than Bob's previous moves, subtly shifting the expectation of who makes larger moves.
* **Highlight value:** Reminding Bob of the product's benefits reinforces its worth and justifies the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come up a bit to  $1,100,000.  Do you think we can make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong profit:** $1,100,000 is a substantial profit margin, well above our minimum and a significant gain from Bob's initial offer. 
* **Shifting momentum:** Bob increased his offer, signaling a potential willingness to settle closer to our price. Pushing further risks a deadlock.
* **Time Value:**  We still have rounds left, but securing a good deal now outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer later, especially considering the risk of Bob walking away."
