Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message:** This is friendly and positive, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob without being pushy. 

**Strategy:**

* **Start high, but be realistic:**  We want to maximize our profit, but also make sure Bob doesn't immediately walk away.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The counteroffer process allows for flexibility and a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Be prepared to walk away:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives us a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below our minimum value of $15,000 and is also quite low compared to our initial offer of $12,000.  While we could potentially accept it, the risk of getting a lower price in the next round is high. 

**Strategy:**

* **Don't settle too quickly:** It's better to reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to our desired price.
* **Control the negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, we maintain control and can try to push for a higher price.
* **Keep John in mind:**  Remember, we have a guaranteed buyer in John, so we're not desperate to sell to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** We're increasing Bob's offer by $1,000 to $10,500.  This is still above Bob's initial value but significantly lower than our initial offer.
* **Message:** We're being firm but polite, acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Strategy:**
    * **Finding a middle ground:** This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground between our initial price and Bob's offer.
    * **Testing the waters:** We want to see if Bob is willing to budge further.
    * **Maintaining leverage:**  While we're moving closer to Bob's price, we're still maintaining some leverage by not accepting his offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I can't go above $10,000. I hope this counteroffer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below our minimum value of $15,000. We have already shown flexibility by coming down from our initial offer of $12,000. At this point, it's clear that we are unlikely to reach an agreement with Bob that meets our minimum value. 

**Strategy:**

* **Secure a guaranteed sale:**  Since John is willing to pay $15,000, it's the most logical decision to sell to him. This guarantees us the highest possible profit and eliminates further negotiation with Bob.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks lowering our price further and wasting time, potentially resulting in a lower sale price than what we could get from John."
