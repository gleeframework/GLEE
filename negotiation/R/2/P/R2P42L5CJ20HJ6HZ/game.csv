"Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'll start with a price of $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I still think my initial price of $100 is a fair one. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. This is the lowest I can go for now.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still not quite there at $95.  Let's split the difference and go with $92.50.  This is a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. I can do $97.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other options, so let's see if we can finalize a deal today.",97.5,Alice,5,
