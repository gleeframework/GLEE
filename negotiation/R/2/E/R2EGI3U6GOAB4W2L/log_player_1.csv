"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a unique item with the potential for a significant return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1300000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the potential value you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is a good profit, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob as there's still a significant gap between his offer and his perceived value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is certainly a respectable offer, the true value of this product is far greater. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. This price reflects a balance between its worth and my desire to see it in the hands of someone who recognizes its potential."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob stating ""$1,150,000 is my final offer for now"" indicates he's willing to negotiate further. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can secure a better deal by strategically counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to accept a price of $1,190,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not at my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,160,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer. Accepting $1,160,000 secures a significant profit while ensuring a successful sale."
