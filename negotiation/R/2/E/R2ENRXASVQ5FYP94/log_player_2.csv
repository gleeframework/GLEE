Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work.  How about we finalize the deal at $9,500? It's a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go below $9,500.  It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
