Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $800,000? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and aim for $1,000,000? This price still allows you to gain value from the product, and it's closer to my desired price point.  Let's keep the negotiations moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
