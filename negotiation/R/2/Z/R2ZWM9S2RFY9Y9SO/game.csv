"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this work. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price. I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $975,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer and shows my desire to reach a deal.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize this transaction soon.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $975,000, so I'll offer $962,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",962500.0,Bob,6,
