Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers, while still being within a range that might entice him to buy.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on selling to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could sell to John for $100 right now, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price of $105, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $100 and Bob's latest offer of $90. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to secure a price that's closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still below my initial asking price, it's only $5 below my minimum acceptable price, and it's closer to my initial goal than John's offer.  I'd rather secure a sale with Bob than risk a prolonged negotiation and potential loss of a sale."
