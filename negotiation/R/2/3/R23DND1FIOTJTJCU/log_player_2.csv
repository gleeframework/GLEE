"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10,000. I think it's a great value for the quality and features it offers, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice closer to her $8,000 value."
