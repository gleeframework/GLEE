"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite willing to go that low. I'm thinking more along the lines of $17000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $12000 and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I need a bit more. How about we meet at $16500? It's a small premium, but it's worth it to me.",16500.0,Alice,5,
