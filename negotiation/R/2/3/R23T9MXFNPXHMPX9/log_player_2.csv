"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for less than $9,500 by counteroffering. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum acceptable price. This allows for potential compromise and reduces the risk of Alice rejecting the offer outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,200, which is closer to Bob's desired price point and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might reject his next counteroffer or raise the price again.  Accepting the current offer secures the product at a good price, minimizing potential risks and delays."
