"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly below your maximum price of $800,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation. By rejecting, you can potentially get a better price without the risk of losing the product to another buyer."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you at $650000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $650,000 is still below your maximum price, but it's getting closer.  Rejecting again allows for further negotiation and the potential to secure an even lower price. You're in a strong position because you have John as a backup option."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm getting closer to your price, $650,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to offer $675,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 675000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I understand that we're getting close to a deal. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you at $670000. This price still reflects the product's worth, but I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $670,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $670,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $670,000 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $675,000.  It's likely that you'll only be able to negotiate a few thousand dollars lower if you reject again.  It's more prudent to accept this offer and secure the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
