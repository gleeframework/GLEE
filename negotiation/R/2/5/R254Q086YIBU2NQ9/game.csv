"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider buying it for a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could meet you at $7,000, which I think is a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
