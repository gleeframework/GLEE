"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $130. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob values the product at $150.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is selling the product for $130.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $150.

Since Alice's offer is lower than Bob's maximum value and lower than John's price, it's the best option for Bob to save money."
