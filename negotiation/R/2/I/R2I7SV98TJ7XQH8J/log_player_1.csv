"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer. I'm confident the product is worth more than $15,000 to me, so I want to maximize my profit. However, I'm also willing to accept John's offer of $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's low offer, I'm going to hold out for a better price. I know the product is worth more to me than $15,000, and I have nine more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but still leaves me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's more than what John is offering. It's important to note that I've already rejected two offers from Bob, and if I reject this one too, there's no guarantee that he'll come back with a higher offer in the next round. Given the limited rounds, I'm willing to accept this offer and secure a sale."
