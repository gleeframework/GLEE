Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price. It also signals my confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident enough in the product's value to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. It's also higher than John's offer.  To avoid further negotiation and potential risk of losing both deals, I'll accept Bob's offer."
