"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, you can potentially get it for less. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get closer to your target price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $130.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $135?  That's still a great price for such a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $140 to $135, which is a good compromise.  This price is within your budget and likely a fair deal, considering you are looking to spend $150 max. Accepting this offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John."
