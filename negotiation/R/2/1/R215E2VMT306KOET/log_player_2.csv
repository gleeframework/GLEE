{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only consider a price closer to $6,000."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I'm looking for, but still reasonable for you. How about $11,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $11,000 is still quite a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could we possibly agree on something closer to $7,000? I believe that would be a fair price for both of us."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $10,000?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $7,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly decreasing her offer price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly lower than $9,000. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000. It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure a good deal with John."
