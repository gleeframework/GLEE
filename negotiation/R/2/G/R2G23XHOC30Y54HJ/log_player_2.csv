"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John right away would be a good option if Bob was in a hurry, but this strategy emphasizes trying to get the best price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,075,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's close enough to his maximum budget that accepting it is a good strategy.  

Here's why:

* **Saving time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks running out of rounds or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further. 
* **Limited risk:**  At $1,075,000, Bob is still saving $25,000 compared to buying from John.  The risk of getting a lower price in the future is outweighed by the certainty of securing the product at a reasonable price."
