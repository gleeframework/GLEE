"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $80. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $80. This is a clear indication of my price limit and sets a starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still above my preferred price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $87.50? I'm really interested in this product and want to make this work."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my initial offer ($80) and Alice's latest offer ($95). This shows a willingness to compromise while staying within my budget. I also reiterate my interest in the product to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $87.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we compromise at $92.50? That's a good midpoint, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $92.50 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. It's worth seeing if we can reach a compromise closer to $87.50.  With several rounds left, I can continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm eager to buy this product, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $90? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a slightly lower price than Alice's last offer, showing willingness to compromise. The price is still within my budget and should be attractive to Alice, who is likely to be getting closer to her desired price."
