"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. Let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $87.50? I'm really interested in this product and want to make this work.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $87.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we compromise at $92.50? That's a good midpoint, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm eager to buy this product, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $90? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
