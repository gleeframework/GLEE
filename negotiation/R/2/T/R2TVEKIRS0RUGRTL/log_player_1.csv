{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay up to $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm not yet ready to settle for $1,600,000. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,600,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers. I'll offer $1,625,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is very close to my desired price and is within a reasonable range.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high.  I'm confident that $1,625,000 is a good deal and will accept it."
