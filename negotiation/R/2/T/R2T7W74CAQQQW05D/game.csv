"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, and it would be a loss for me, but I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
