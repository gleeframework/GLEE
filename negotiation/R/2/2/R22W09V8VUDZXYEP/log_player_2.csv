"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great price, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price or you can buy it from John and save $2,000."
