"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation.  Bob's initial offer was very low, and I'm not willing to accept it so early in the process. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $1,500,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1500000, but I still think that's a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my desired price. We're getting closer, but I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we settle at $1,400,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1350000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're placing on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is close to my desired price.  Considering that we only have four rounds left, I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal.  It's better than selling to John for $1,200,000."
