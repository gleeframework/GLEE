Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I would like to propose a price of $9500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with my own. While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $10500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good deal. It's above my minimum price of $10,000, and it's worth risking another round to try and push for a higher price. However, there's always the risk that he'll reject my counteroffer and I might end up with nothing. It's better to take the sure deal."
