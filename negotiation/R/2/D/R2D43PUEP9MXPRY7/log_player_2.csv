# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.

Alice's offer:

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I can still do better. I will reject the offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.

While $10,500 is closer to my budget, I can get the product for $8,000 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, especially since she's already stated her final offer.  I'll go with John's offer and save some money."
