"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130 for the product?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. While $130 is a good price, it's still slightly below what I'm looking to get for the product. How about we split the difference at $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still aiming to keep my spending within $120. Could you consider $130 as a final offer?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $130 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $132, which is a fair compromise. If you're genuinely interested, let's close this deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm grateful for your flexibility. I'd like to stick to my budget and propose $128 as the final offer.",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $128 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. If you're not willing to go higher, I might have to consider selling to someone else.",130.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I've considered your last offer, but I must stick to my budget. I propose $129 as the final offer.",129.0,Bob,8,
