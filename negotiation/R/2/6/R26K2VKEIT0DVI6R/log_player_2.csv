"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $15,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $12,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a product that could significantly enhance your experience or operations. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to serve you. Kind regards, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly inflating the perceived value of the product to you. While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, it's significantly higher than the $8,000 value it holds for Alice. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're a savvy buyer and might encourage her to propose a lower price closer to its actual worth."
