I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($150). I'm hoping to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware that Bob's value for the product is $120. I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $150. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues it. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum value of $150. I believe this counteroffer is fair considering Bob's initial offer and my need to make a reasonable profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

While I'd prefer to sell the product to Bob, his latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  To ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $150."
