"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $12,000, which is still a great deal considering the value it holds. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
