Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to selling to John at $120.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with an offer slightly below John's price allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While I could start at a much higher price, it might discourage Bob completely. This offer balances profit maximization with a reasonable chance of Bob accepting."
