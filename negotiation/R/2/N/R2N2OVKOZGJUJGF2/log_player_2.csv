Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a price that works for you. $1400000 is still a bit below what I need to consider, but I'm open to finding a solution.  How about we compromise at $1600000?  This would be a significant step closer to your offer, while still allowing me to recover a substantial portion of the product's value.
