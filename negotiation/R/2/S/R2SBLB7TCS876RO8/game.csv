"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident it will be a great investment for your company.  Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's more than what John is offering.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $900,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good outcome.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $875,000 is a good starting point, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $887,500?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal. What do you say?",887500.0,Alice,5,
