You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less from John. It's always worth exploring your options and trying to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $900,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good outcome.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

You should reject Alice's offer. You're still above your target price of $800,000, and you know John is willing to sell it to you for that price.  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down a little further before going with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $875,000 is a good starting point, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $887,500?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

You should buy the product from John.  While Alice is getting closer to your target price, you are still above it. Since John is offering the product for your target price, it makes more sense to go with him and avoid further negotiation."
