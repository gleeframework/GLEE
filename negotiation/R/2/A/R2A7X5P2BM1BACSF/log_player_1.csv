Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would ensure a smooth transaction and be fair to both of us.  What do you think?
