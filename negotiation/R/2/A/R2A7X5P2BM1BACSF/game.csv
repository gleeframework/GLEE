"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,550,000, which reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both parties.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would ensure a smooth transaction and be fair to both of us.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
