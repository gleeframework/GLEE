Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the value Bob sees in the product ($15,000) strengthens my position.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussion, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John gives me the confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $12,000 by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a safety net:** If I fail to reach an agreement with Bob, selling to John guarantees a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** The message emphasizes a willingness to compromise, making the counteroffer feel more reasonable.
* **Value Justification:**  I reiterate the value Bob sees in the product, justifying the price.
* **Significant Discount:**  Stating that it's a significant discount from the initial offer further strengthens my position.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The ending question leaves room for further discussion and negotiation.
* **Calculated Counteroffer:** $10,500 is a reasonable middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, so I'm thinking $9,750. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $9,750 is only $750 below my previous counteroffer of $10,500. This is a relatively small gap, and accepting it means I'll be close to my desired price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he will walk away from the negotiation, leaving me with only the option to sell to John for $8,000.
* **Time Factor:**  Further negotiation could be time-consuming, and accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'm accepting the offer now, it doesn't preclude the possibility of renegotiating the price later on if I find other buyers who are willing to pay more."
