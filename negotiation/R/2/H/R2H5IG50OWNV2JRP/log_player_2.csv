"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  I'm confident it's worth $1200000 to you, and I'm starting with a price of $1400000.  This gives us room to negotiate, and I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the market value and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?  This price recognizes the value of the product while leaving room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000,  which is a fair compromise.  Let's reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1175000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value of the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still a bit higher than your target. There's still room for negotiation to potentially get the price down to $1,200,000 or very close to it.  Continuing the negotiation gives you a better chance of saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. $1,175,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still hoping to come in under $1,200,000. I'm willing to offer $1,190,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach a final agreement with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to accept $1195000.  This is a small compromise on my end, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,195,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,195,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $5,000 over your maximum price point of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer is the best choice as it saves you $5,000 compared to buying from John. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get you a lower price, and you're running out of rounds."
