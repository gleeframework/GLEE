"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($2,000,000) compared to Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet halfway? I propose $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high at $1,400,000. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering both our positions. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to a workable figure, I can't accept anything less than $1,250,000. This product has significant value that I'm confident justifies this price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Even if Bob were to counteroffer again, it's unlikely Alice will go lower than $1,000,000, which is still too high.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $800,000,  it's the most financially sensible option.  Further negotiation with Alice is likely to be unproductive."
