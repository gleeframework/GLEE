"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of $12,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you coming down to $10,500. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still holding out for a price closer to $12,000.  I believe I can get a better offer from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,100.  This is my final offer, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,100. I'm willing to pay up to $9,900. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm tempted by Bob's offer of $9,900, I'm going to reject it. I'm only a few hundred dollars away from my ideal price of $12,000, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob. I'm confident that he's willing to pay a bit more, especially since he's mentioned that he's considering buying from John."
