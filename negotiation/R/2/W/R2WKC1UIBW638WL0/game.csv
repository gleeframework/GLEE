"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its features and benefits, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my maximum budget for this item.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a generous offer considering the product's quality and features.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $19,000 is still above what I can afford.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $15,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,4,
