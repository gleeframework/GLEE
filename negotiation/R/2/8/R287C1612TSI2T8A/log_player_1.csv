Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering a price too close to John's offer ($120) leaves potential profit on the table. 
 
This strategy aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product at a price lower than his perceived value, and you maximize your profit beyond what you'd get from John."
