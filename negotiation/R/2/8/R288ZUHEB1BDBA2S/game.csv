"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, your asking price seems a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering its value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little steep for me. Would you be willing to settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
