"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $775,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
