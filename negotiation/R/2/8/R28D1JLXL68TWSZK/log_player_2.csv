It's time to walk away from Alice. Her price is barely budging, and she's clearly trying to wear you down. John's offer of $800,000 is starting to look pretty good compared to the prospect of Alice dragging this out further and potentially only coming down slightly.  You've negotiated in good faith, and it's not worth the risk of overpaying just to close with Alice."
