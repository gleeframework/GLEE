"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, I'm aiming for a price closer to $500,000. Would you consider $510,000?",510000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $510,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway.  To be honest, $530,000 is the highest I'm able to go.  It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",530000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $530,000 is your limit, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $560,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",560000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I can stretch my budget a bit further, but $540,000 is absolutely the best I can do.  Let's make this deal happen!",540000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $540,000 is your best offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $570,000. This is the last time I'll be willing to negotiate, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",570000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting frustrating.  You said $560,000 was your bottom line. I'm willing to meet you at $550,000, but that's it.  Take it or leave it.",550000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're frustrated, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $550,000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer. I'll meet you at $580,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",580000.0,Alice,9,
