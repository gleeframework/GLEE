"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in your product but I'd need to get it for a much lower price to make it work for me. How about $12,000? I'm sure we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This price still reflects the significant value of the product, but it's a considerable compromise on my end. What are your thoughts?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about buying your product, but I need to stay within a tighter budget. I'm prepared to offer $14,000.  This represents a significant step forward for me, and I hope we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to drop the price to $15,500. This is a significant compromise for me, but I'm confident that the value of the product will justify the investment.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still committed to purchasing your product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm prepared to offer $14,500, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This reflects the value I see in your product and my desire to close a deal.  Let's finalize this, I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,6,
