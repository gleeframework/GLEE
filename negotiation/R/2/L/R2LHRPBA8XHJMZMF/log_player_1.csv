Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get the highest price possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, she should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still potentially landing above the $10,000 fallback.
* **Gauge Interest:** A higher initial offer helps Alice understand how interested Bob truly is and how much he might be willing to pay. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't have ethical concerns about potentially overcharging Bob. In a real-world scenario, fairness and transparency in pricing are important factors to consider."
