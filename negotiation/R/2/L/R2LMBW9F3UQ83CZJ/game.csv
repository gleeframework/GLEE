,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",180.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,220.0
"I understand that $180 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $210?",210.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $210 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $190, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $190?",190.0,Bob,4,,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $192 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $180, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",180.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,188.0
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $188, and I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at $188. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",188.0,Alice,9,,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,
"I really like the product, but $188 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $180, and that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to walk away and buy the product from John for $100.",180.0,Bob,10,,
