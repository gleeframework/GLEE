"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal.  Let me know if this is something you can work with.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price further? Perhaps to $825,000? I believe this would allow us to reach an agreement that suits both of our needs.",825000.0,Bob,4,
