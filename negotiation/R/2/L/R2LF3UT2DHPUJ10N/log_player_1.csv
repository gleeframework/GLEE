"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good deal.  It's important to start high, but I'm also cognizant of the 10-round limit and the potential of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to get the best price possible, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my value, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value. I hope this will encourage Bob to compromise and reach a deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident that I can achieve a better price through further negotiation.  It's risky, but I'm willing to take the chance for a higher profit, considering we have six rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping my counteroffer slightly to $1,600,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise further while still holding firm on my minimum value. I believe this price is more appealing to Bob while still being within a range that benefits me.  With five rounds remaining, I want to keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. However, with four rounds left and the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000 always looming, I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. I believe we can reach a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,550,000. This shows I'm serious about reaching a deal and am willing to be flexible. It's a significant drop from my previous offer but still above my minimum value and closer to Bob's latest offer. With only four rounds remaining, I need to keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left and Bob consistently offering below my minimum, I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John. While I would have liked to get a higher price, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation, especially since I know John will buy it at my minimum price. It's better to secure a guaranteed $1,500,000 than risk ending up with less."
