"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of this product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a respectable price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,200,000, which would be $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
