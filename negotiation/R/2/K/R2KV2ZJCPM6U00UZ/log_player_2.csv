"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price that I believe is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from her original price of $1,100,000 and brings the price closer to Bob's desired range. Accepting this offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John, making it the best option at this point."
