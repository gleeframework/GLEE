Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's reasonable:** You're not asking for the full $120 value Bob places on the product, which makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **It's open to negotiation:** You're signaling that you're willing to work with Bob, which can lead to a more successful deal. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is above your minimum of $80 and is a good compromise. Accepting his offer will allow you to make a profit and avoid further negotiation."
