You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to your target, but I'm not willing to give away too much profit. How about we meet at $102? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go any lower. Accepting at $102 secures a decent discount while avoiding the risk of her retracting the offer entirely."
