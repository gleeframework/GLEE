Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to me, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible. I'll offer Bob the product at a price of $110.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value of $120, so I'll reject it and try to get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll offer Bob the product at a price of $105. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 105}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send the counteroffer to Bob.
