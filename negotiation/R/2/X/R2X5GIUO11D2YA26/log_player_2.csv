"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the logical next step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $95. This is below my maximum budget of $100, and it leaves room for negotiation. While Alice might reject this offer, it sets the stage for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is within my budget and is a better price than John's offer. Accepting this offer allows me to save money compared to buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject my counteroffer and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
