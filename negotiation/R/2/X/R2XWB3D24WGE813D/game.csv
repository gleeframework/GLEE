"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you halfway at $110, but that's as low as I can go.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I still think $95 is a bit too low. I can do $105, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're really tough!  I'm willing to go up a bit to $100, but that's my absolute limit.",100.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I can do $110, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,7,
