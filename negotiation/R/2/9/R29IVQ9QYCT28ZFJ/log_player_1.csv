"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $75. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $75 is below my minimum price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $75 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That seems fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  $80 is my minimum price, and it's better than selling to John for the same price."
