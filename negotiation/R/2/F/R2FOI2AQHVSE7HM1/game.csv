"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $112?",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer! I'm willing to go down to $113. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.",113.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $113 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112 and $113, which would be $112.50. Can you consider that?",112.5,Bob,6,
