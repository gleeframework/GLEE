"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($600,000 vs. $800,000). I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always buy from John for $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000, which is still a significant discount from what I could pay elsewhere.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $650,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my target of saving as much money as possible. I still have 7 rounds to negotiate and can always fall back to buying from John. I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $650,000 is still a bit high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $700,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential savings you'll get from closing the deal quickly. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $700,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you and the potential benefits of doing business together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $675,000 is closer to my target price and only $25,000 higher than my last counteroffer.  I've already used up 4 rounds of negotiation and we're getting close to the midpoint of the available rounds.  It's likely that further negotiation will yield only minor price reductions, and I could end up paying more if I continue to reject Alice's offers. It's in my best interest to accept her offer and secure the product at a price that saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John."
