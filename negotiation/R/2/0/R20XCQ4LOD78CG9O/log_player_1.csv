Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going below our own $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $1,150,000, we leave room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above our guaranteed sale to John.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting a limited-time offer and other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer quickly."
