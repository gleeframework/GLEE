"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $80? That's my absolute maximum.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. That's a fair compromise, and hopefully we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $110. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really like the product.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
