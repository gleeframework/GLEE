"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I want to see how interested Bob is in the product and gauge his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's still a good deal for Bob, and it gives me a chance to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I still have time and can potentially get a better price. I'm not ready to settle for less than my minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $11,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm not desperate to sell for a low price. Hopefully, this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,500 is still below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my price. It's getting late in the game, but I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going down to $10,500. This is a significant concession but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows Bob my willingness to negotiate, and maybe he'll finally meet me halfway. With only a few rounds left, I need to make a move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very close to the end of the negotiations, and Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum. Although I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, it's important to secure the sale.  John's offer of $12,000 is my guaranteed minimum, so I'm going to sell to him."
