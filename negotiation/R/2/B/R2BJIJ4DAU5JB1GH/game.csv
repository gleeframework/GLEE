"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8000 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",8800.0,Alice,5,
