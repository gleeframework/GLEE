I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested in a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be agreeable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, $9,500 is a fair deal and significantly more than selling to John. It's time to accept Bob's offer."
