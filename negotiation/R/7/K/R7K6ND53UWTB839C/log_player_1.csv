Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a slight justification like ""given its value"" can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Phrases like ""What do you think?"" encourage a response from Bob and keep the lines of communication open for further negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might want to start with a slightly lower offer. However, since the product is worth the asking price to him, aiming higher initially isn't a bad strategy. 
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, you have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, so you're not losing out completely."
