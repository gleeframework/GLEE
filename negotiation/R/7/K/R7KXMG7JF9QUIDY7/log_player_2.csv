"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and Bob has a ceiling of $1,500,000. There's a significant margin for negotiation, making it worthwhile to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,100,000. This would give us both a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate while still leaving room for further negotiation. It's a bold move that could potentially lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer is a decent move, but Bob can still improve the price. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and Bob's ceiling is $1,500,000. There's still room to negotiate and get a better price.  Bob can push for a lower price, potentially around $1,150,000, which would still be a good deal for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,162,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1162500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is still looking for a better price.  It also sets a clear expectation for Alice, making it more likely she'll accept and avoid further negotiation."
