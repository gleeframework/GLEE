"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the time we've already spent negotiating.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me and the time we've invested in this negotiation.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
