Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth $100 to you, and she's asking for $200. It's time to counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

While $170 is closer to your value, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's final offer is still higher than what you're comfortable paying. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $100, which is within your budget."
