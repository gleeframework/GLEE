"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $15,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation of the product. It's clear there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000."", ""product_price"": 9000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  There's a good chance Alice will counter, and this offer leaves space for Bob to gradually increase his price while staying well under his $12,000 limit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This lowball offer helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be with her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is closer to her valuation but still above your $12,000 maximum.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's room to negotiate further. Alice is showing a willingness to come down from her initial price.
* **John is an Option:**  Remember, you can always buy from John for $12,000. It's good to keep that in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($13,000) and your previous offer ($9,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still working towards a price within your budget.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $11,000 puts you in a strong position. It's unlikely Alice will want to lose the sale over $1,000, especially if she believes you might walk away and buy from John. 
* **Deadline in Mind:** You still have several rounds to negotiate, but keeping the $12,000 alternative in mind prevents you from getting stuck in a prolonged back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000, which is $12,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Over Budget:** Alice is sticking close to her valuation, and her offer of $12,250 is still above your $12,000 maximum. 
* **John's Price is Better:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000.  
* **Limited Gains from Further Negotiation:**  While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from her current price. You'd be risking losing the opportunity to buy from John for a small potential savings."
