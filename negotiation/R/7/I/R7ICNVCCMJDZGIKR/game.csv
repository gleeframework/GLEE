"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. That's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. Could we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $1,025,000? It's a fair price that's closer to what I need, and it still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for sticking with me.  I'm ready to close this deal, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high.  My final offer is $1,000,000. I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
