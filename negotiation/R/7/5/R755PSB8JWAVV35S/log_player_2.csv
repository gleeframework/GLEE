"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob.  He's aiming to save as much as possible and has a fallback option with John for $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my target range and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. My revised offer is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still outside of Bob's ideal range. He is still within his negotiation rounds and has a better offer from John, so rejecting the offer allows him to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. My revised offer is $975,000. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal range, it's still above his target of $800,000.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes sense to reject the offer and continue negotiating for a better price. He still has several rounds left, so there's room to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $925,000 for the product. This is a substantial increase from my last offer and reflects the value I see in your product. I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $925,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. My revised offer is $950,000, which is the same as my previous offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has been negotiating and showing a willingness to compromise, her offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's ideal range.  With only a few rounds left, Bob needs to make a decision that maximizes his savings.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, Bob is better off purchasing from John at this point. This ensures that he achieves his goal of saving as much money as possible."
