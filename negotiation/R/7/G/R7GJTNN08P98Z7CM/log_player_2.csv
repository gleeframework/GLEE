Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we aim for a price closer to the midpoint between our offers? I suggest $750,000 for the product. This is still above its worth to you but significantly lower than my initial offer. I hope this proposal works for you.
