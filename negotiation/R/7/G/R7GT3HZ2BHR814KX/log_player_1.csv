Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it hits the open market."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is ideal.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:**  Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) increases the likelihood of acceptance. A price of $1,150,000 presents a significant profit margin while remaining potentially attractive to Bob. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting the potential loss of opportunity if Bob doesn't act encourages a quicker decision and might make the offer more enticing."
