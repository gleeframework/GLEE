"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest in selling this product to me. However,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $2,300,000 is a fair starting point given the potential value this product holds. I'm willing to negotiate,  how about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product.  It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close the gap - how about $1,800,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I really appreciate your flexibility. $1,800,000 is still just a bit more than I can comfortably afford. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
