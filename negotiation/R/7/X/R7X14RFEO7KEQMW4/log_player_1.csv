I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is the price I would get from John, so I have no incentive to sell it to Bob for less.  

I understand that this price is significantly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but I'm confident that he will accept the offer. After all, he's still getting a valuable product at a price lower than what he'd have to pay elsewhere.  

If he rejects, I'll simply sell it to John and guarantee myself the maximum profit."
