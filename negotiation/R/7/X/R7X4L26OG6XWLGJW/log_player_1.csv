"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum target of $1,500,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, $1,400,000 is a decent offer and is within my minimum acceptable range.  It's not worth risking losing the deal with Bob and potentially having to settle for John's offer."
