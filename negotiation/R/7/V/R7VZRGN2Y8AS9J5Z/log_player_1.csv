Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and see if it's worth negotiating further or if I should just go with John's guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still less than what I initially offered. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $920,000 is a good compromise and is significantly better than selling to John for $800,000.  It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed backup option, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks."
