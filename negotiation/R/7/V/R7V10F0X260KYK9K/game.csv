"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",80.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $80, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $75. How about $77.50? Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",77.5,Bob,6,
