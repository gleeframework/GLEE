"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What are your thoughts?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value of this product, $600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm prepared to offer $500,000 for the product. This reflects my current assessment of its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $550,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $550,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get it for a little less. I'm willing to offer $525,000. This is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about making a deal, but also reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",525000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $575,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $550,000 and $575,000, so I'm offering the product for $562,500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",562500.0,Alice,5,
