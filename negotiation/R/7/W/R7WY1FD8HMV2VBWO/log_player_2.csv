"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you, Bob. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both her value and John's price. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still gives room for negotiation while staying well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly above her value.  We should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while staying firm on a price that's closer to a fair deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money. I can offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is barely budging from her previous offer. This suggests she might be getting close to her bottom line, but we still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $10,500 as my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise but also sets a firm limit to signal that this is a serious offer. 
* **Finality:** By stating this is a ""final offer,""  we create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to make a decision.
* **Alternative:**  We're still comfortably below John's price, leaving us with a fallback option if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really committed to this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000 one last time, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to go lower:** Her language (""one last time,"" ""as low as I can go"") suggests she's reached her limit.
* **Time is a factor:**  With fewer rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal increases. 
* **Savings are significant:** $11,000 is still a significant discount from John's $15,000 price. 

While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are likely outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
