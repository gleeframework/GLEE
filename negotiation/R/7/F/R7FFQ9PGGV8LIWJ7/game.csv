"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a fair deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find common ground. While I value your offer, I need to make a slightly higher profit to justify the sale. Let's try $1,340,000. I believe this is a fair midpoint that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
