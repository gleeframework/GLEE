"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still represents a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you.  Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $10,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $10,900 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to you. Let's finalize this deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,
