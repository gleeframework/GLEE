"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $11,500 is too high, and there's room to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still represents a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$11,000 is still a bit too high.  It's worth trying to get closer to my ideal price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $10,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $10,900 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to you. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly and is very close to my ideal price. Accepting this offer saves me $100 compared to buying from John.  It's worth closing the deal at this point."
