{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers incredible value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with your purchase."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible. 
* **Bob's Perspective:**  While the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a bit more to avoid missing out.
* **John as a Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Why this price?**

Offering the product just below your guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and perceived value.  It positions the offer as a ""deal"" while still securing a significant profit for you."
