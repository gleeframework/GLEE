"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the benefits it can bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits to both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $885,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",885000.0,Alice,5,
