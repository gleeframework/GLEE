Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he might get a ""deal.""
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice is subtly reinforcing that her asking price is justified. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning that she'll list it publicly if Bob declines, Alice creates a subtle sense of urgency and competition. 

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, Alice's goal is to maximize her profit. Simply settling for $8,000 with John should be a last resort."
