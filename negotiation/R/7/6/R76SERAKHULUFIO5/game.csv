"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $13000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer $12500. This is the highest I can go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
