Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You're willing to accept less than your minimum, demonstrating flexibility.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Both parties can adjust their positions. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to re-evaluate the situation based on his counteroffer and John's interest in buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I'm very interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While $12,500 is a better offer than his initial $12,000, it's still not close enough to my desired price. 

I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price through counter-offers. However, I'll need to be mindful that John is still a viable option, and I might need to move quickly to secure a sale before he decides to purchase elsewhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 13750} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer takes the average of my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing fairness and both parties' satisfaction. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** The $13,750 price is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This ensures I don't lose money on the deal.

By taking this approach, I hope to find a compromise with Bob while still preserving my potential sale with John if the negotiation falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,250. This price is reasonable, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $13,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to make sure I get a price that's fair to me.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a little higher. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind, and I might need to switch to him if negotiations with Bob don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,250 is closer, but I'm still a little away from my target. Would you be open to $13,500? That's a fair compromise that would allow me to accept your offer. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I've increased the price by $250 from Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm flexible and willing to meet him halfway.
* **Focus on Value:** I've emphasized the product's value to reiterate the worth of my offer and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** I've framed this offer as a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

I'm still cautiously optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob, but I'm ready to switch to John if this offer is rejected."
