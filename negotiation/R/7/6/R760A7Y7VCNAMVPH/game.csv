"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I'm very interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,250. This price is reasonable, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,250 is closer, but I'm still a little away from my target. Would you be open to $13,500? That's a fair compromise that would allow me to accept your offer. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it.",13500.0,Alice,5,
