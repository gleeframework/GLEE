"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't want to go any higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far off from that price. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would give us both a fair deal. Let's close this negotiation!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but no higher. Can we meet in the middle again?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $920,000 is still a little low for me. Let's compromise once more - I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's make a deal!",940000.0,Alice,5,
