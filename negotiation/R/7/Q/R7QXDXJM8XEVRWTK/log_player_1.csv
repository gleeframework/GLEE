"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards the higher end of your desired range. This leaves room for potential concessions while still aiming for a profitable outcome. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer of $1,100,000 is below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, providing an incentive for him to engage. It also allows space for negotiation and counteroffers.
* **Confident and Positive Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value while maintaining a polite and collaborative tone. This helps foster a positive negotiating atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly below our target price and even further from his own perceived value of the product. While it's higher than our safety net of $800,000 (selling to John), there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we're serious about obtaining a price closer to the product's true worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $1,050,000.  This represents a reasonable compromise, reflecting the value while still offering you a great deal."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down from our initial offer but not drastically. The $50,000 reduction shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but the $1,050,000 price point keeps us firmly in our desired range.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of his own $1,200,000 valuation.
* **Compromise and Benefit:**  By framing the counteroffer as a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" and ""a great deal,"" we maintain a positive tone and encourage Bob to meet us closer to our target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  To make this deal work, I'd like to propose a price of $1,000,000.  This offer reflects the potential of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 represents a strong profit for us. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's always the risk that Bob will walk away or become less willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer secures a substantial gain and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
