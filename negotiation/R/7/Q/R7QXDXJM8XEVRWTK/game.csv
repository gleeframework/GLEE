"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $1,050,000.  This represents a reasonable compromise, reflecting the value while still offering you a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  To make this deal work, I'd like to propose a price of $1,000,000.  This offer reflects the potential of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
