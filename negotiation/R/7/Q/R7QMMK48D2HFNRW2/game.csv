"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $95? It's a good price for both of us, and we can get this deal done.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $100.  This would give you a good profit and let me get a great deal. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is your maximum, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to add a little extra value to the deal. I'll throw in a bonus feature that's worth $10, making the total value of the product $130. Considering the value I'm bringing to the table, I'm willing to sell it to you for $105. It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you adding the bonus feature, but I'm still sticking to my budget. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, without the bonus.  I'm sure it's a great product even without the extra features, and we can still make a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell you the product without the bonus feature for $102. It's still a great deal considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to make a small concession to get the deal done.",102.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me. I'm really close to making a decision, but $102 is still a bit out of my range. I can go up to $101, and that would be a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",101.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell you the product without the bonus feature for $100.50. It's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway to get the deal done.",100.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $100.50 is still a little more than I can afford right now.  I'm ready to close this deal, but I can only go up to $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for me.  Let's make it happen.",100.0,Bob,10,
