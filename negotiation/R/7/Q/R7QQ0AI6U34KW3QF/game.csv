"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity.  I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. My starting price is $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial deal, but this is a fair starting point given the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. To reach a deal, I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not comfortable accepting that price.  To find common ground, I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $1,090,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,085,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further negotiation.",1085000.0,Bob,6,
