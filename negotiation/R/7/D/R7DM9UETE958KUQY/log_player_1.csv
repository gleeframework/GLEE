"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's potential value:**  I emphasize the potential value the product holds for Bob, aiming to pique his interest.
* **Open to discussion:**  The message ends with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is my maximum budget. Can you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a higher price. Selling to John right now would secure a decent profit, but there's a chance I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,750,000. This price reflects the value I believe it holds for you, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's constraints:** I acknowledge Bob's budget limitations to show I'm listening and willing to compromise.
* **Meeting halfway:** I propose a price that's closer to Bob's offer while still being significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Highlighting value for Bob:** I reiterate the potential value of the product for Bob, hoping to encourage him to see the worth in the offer.
* **Positioning as a fair compromise:**  I frame the counteroffer as a fair compromise, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you consider another compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I would prefer a bit more, accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a profit. It's also likely that further negotiations would be protracted and might result in a lower final price or even a deal falling through. Selling to John would get me the same amount, but it would be less efficient as it would involve a separate transaction."
