"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's in great condition and worth a lot more to you, so I think this is a fair price. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that amount?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget. Could we discuss $110 as a potential compromise?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to compromise, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $115? This price is closer to your budget and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!",115.0,Alice,5,
