"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm hoping for $9,000. This would still be a great price for a product worth $10,000 to me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit lower on the price. How about we meet at $8,200?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're not quite on the same page yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $8,200 is still too far off for me.  How about we settle on $8,750? It's a fair compromise and would give us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",8750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $8,750, but I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 still isn't quite right for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,625? This would be a good price for both of us, and I'd rather sell to you than anyone else. What do you say?",8625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,625. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which I think is a fair price for both of us. Can we agree on that?",8500.0,Bob,8,
