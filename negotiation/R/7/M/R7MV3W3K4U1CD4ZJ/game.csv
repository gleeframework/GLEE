"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $14,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
