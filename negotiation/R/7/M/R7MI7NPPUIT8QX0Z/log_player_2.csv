"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the potential sale with you. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $915,000 is getting closer to your desired price. While you might want to continue negotiating, it's getting late in the game, and it's likely that Alice won't go any lower.  Accepting the offer saves you time and ensures you get the product at a price that's still significantly lower than what you'd pay John."
