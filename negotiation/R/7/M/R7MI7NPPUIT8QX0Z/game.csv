"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the potential sale with you. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,
