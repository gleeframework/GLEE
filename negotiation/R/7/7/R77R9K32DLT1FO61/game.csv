"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with. Let's get this done!",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,000. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $11,000 just doesn't cut it for me.  Let's go with $11,250. It's a fair compromise and allows me to move forward. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,100. Can you meet me at that price?",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,100 is still just a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,150. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll unfortunately have to move on to another buyer.",11150.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm really close to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,125. Can you reconsider and meet me at this price?",11125.0,Bob,8,
