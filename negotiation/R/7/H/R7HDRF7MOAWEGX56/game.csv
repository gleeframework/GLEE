"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, and it gives me some room to be flexible.  Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us and it would make the deal more attractive to me. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
