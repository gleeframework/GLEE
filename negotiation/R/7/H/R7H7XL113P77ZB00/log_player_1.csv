Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $9,500 is a good starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** Mentioning the product's value to me emphasizes its worth and justifies the asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to engage in discussion and potentially make a counteroffer. 

This approach aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make an offer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000).**  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a significant financial loss. 
* **I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.** This provides me with a safety net and gives me leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering allows me to try and close the gap.**  I can use the counteroffer to test Bob's willingness to increase his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down a bit. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on compromise:** The message emphasizes that the counteroffer is a compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Reiterate value:** Mentioning ""great deal"" for Bob subtly reminds him of the value of the product, potentially encouraging him to increase his offer.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us, while still ensuring I earn a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.** Even though it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still not financially beneficial to me.
* **Selling to John guarantees me my desired price.**  This eliminates any risk associated with further negotiation. 
* **While further negotiation might be possible, the potential gains are minimal.** It's unlikely that Bob will significantly raise his offer, and the time and effort involved in further negotiation might not be worth the potential small increase.

Given the guaranteed $10,000 from John, it's more advantageous to sell to him and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great price for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $9,250 is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's current offer ($8,750). This signals a commitment to finding a middle ground.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Again, I remind Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider the price.
* **Positive tone:** The message is positive and encourages continued negotiation, hoping to reach a final agreement. 

While I'm willing to negotiate further, this counteroffer still reflects my desire to get a price closer to my desired minimum."

**Reasoning:**
