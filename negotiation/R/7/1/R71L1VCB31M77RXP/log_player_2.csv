"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is way too high. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested, but could you come down to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This offer is significantly lower than my $80 maximum, leaving room for me to increase my offer during the negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do $90, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great product and I think it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, but it's still above my ideal price. I'll reject and counteroffer again, trying to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming to stay below my $80 maximum. This counteroffer puts us in a good position to potentially reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do $85, but that's as close to the middle as I'm willing to get. It's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $85, which is above my maximum price. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $80. While I could try to haggle Alice down further, it's not worth the risk of her not budging and me missing out on the guaranteed $80 price from John."
