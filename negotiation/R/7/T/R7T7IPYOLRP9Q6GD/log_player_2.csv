Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is $110, which is still within your budget of $120. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer, and you'd end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a price you're comfortable with."
