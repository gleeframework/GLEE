"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong initial position and gives me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will be intrigued and come back with a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I need to consider his offer seriously, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and hopefully signals to Bob that a deal is still possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating with him. It's possible we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to a price I'm comfortable with.  However, I'm also getting closer to my limit, and I'm considering the option of selling to John. I have 4 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time to $1,550,000. This is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. If he doesn't, I'm seriously considering selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the game.  Even though Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm concerned that we won't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.  Since John is a guaranteed buyer for $1,500,000, I'm going to sell the product to him now."
