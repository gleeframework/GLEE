Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll see what Bob's reaction is and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'd rather try to get closer to my original price of $200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my original offer.  It's still a decent price for me, but it also shows that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only $10 less than my last counteroffer and is closer to my desired outcome than selling to John.  It's likely that Bob will not increase his offer again, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
