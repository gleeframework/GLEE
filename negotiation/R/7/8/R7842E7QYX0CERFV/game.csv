"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000.

"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
