{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120. That's far too expensive. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."

While $105 is closer to my target, it's still too expensive. I'll keep trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $99 is tempting, but I've already invested a lot of time in this negotiation. I only have one round left, and it's likely she'll reject my counteroffer again.  I'm better off buying the product from John for $80. It's a better deal, and I can avoid further negotiation."
