"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $12000. I think you'll find it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $11000 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10000?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $10000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
