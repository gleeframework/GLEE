"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the warranty and support. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your proposal, but I must maintain a reasonable margin for the product. Therefore, I would like to counteroffer at $9,500 for the product. This price includes all the benefits we discussed earlier, along with an extended warranty period.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit out of my comfort zone at $9,500. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute top limit.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a final price of $9,200 for the product. This includes all the benefits we've discussed, plus a slight extension on the warranty period. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value you place on the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
