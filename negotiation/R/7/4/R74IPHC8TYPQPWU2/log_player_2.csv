"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Considering its value and the benefits it brings, I propose a price of $12,000. This offer includes a comprehensive warranty and personalized support to ensure your satisfaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the warranty and support. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your proposal, but I must maintain a reasonable margin for the product. Therefore, I would like to counteroffer at $9,500 for the product. This price includes all the benefits we discussed earlier, along with an extended warranty period. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for less from John. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit out of my comfort zone at $9,500. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute top limit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a final price of $9,200 for the product. This includes all the benefits we've discussed, plus a slight extension on the warranty period. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation and the price is getting closer to his budget, but it's still above his $8,000 limit. He's already reached his top limit with Alice, and it seems unlikely Alice will go any lower. 

John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, and it's worth saving the time and effort of further negotiation."
