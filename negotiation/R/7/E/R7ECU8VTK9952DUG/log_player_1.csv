{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'd accept, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit.  This approach aims to maximize my chances of getting a favorable deal while also being open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still slightly below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,650,000.  This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}
``` 

I've lowered my price by $100,000 from my initial counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This should encourage Bob to accept while still leaving room for me to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,550,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further price concessions is not worth the potential gain.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a clean transaction and avoids further negotiation uncertainty."
