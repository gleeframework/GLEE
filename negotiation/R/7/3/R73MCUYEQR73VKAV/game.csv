"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify paying around $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $15,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is cutting it a little close.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
