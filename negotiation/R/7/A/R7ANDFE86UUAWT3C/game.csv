"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still quite attached to this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? It's a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $16000? It's a fair price that I think will benefit both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $15500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $15500. I'm willing to make another small compromise. How about we meet at $16250? It's a price that I think is fair and still reflects the value of the product.",16250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, but $16250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15750, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",15750.0,Bob,8,

"I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach an agreement. I'm thinking of $15500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $8000.",15500.0,Bob,10,
