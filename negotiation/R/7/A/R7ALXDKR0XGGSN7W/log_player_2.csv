"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John. Alice's offer is still too high. It's better to reject and counteroffer to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's offering $10,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for compromise while still being considerably lower than Bob's maximum price of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's desired price range.  While it's lower than her original offer, it's still more expensive than Bob's counteroffer.  Bob can likely still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer from $10,000 to $11,000, showing willingness to compromise. This is still a significant discount from Alice's latest offer of $12,500, and it's closer to his desired price point. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still putting pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  However, Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice has rejected them.  There's a chance that continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price, but it's also possible that Alice will not budge further.  Since Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John, it's safer to buy from John and avoid the risk of Alice continuing to refuse further negotiations."
