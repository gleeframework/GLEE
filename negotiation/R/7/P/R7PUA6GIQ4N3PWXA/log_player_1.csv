Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit. While she has a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, she can potentially get more from Bob.

**The Risk:** If Alice asks for too much, Bob will reject her offer, and she'll have to settle for the guaranteed $1,500,000.

**The Solution:** Alice needs to find a price that's enticing enough for Bob to accept but also significantly higher than her fallback option. 

**Here's a possible offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct and Positive Tone:**  The message starts by emphasizing the exclusivity and value of the product. 
* **Strong Justification:**  Alice justifies the high price by highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Setting the price at $1,900,000 creates a significant potential profit margin for Alice while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Alice could adjust her price and message based on her assessment of Bob's personality, negotiation style, and how much she believes he truly wants the product."
