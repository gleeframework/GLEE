"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but could you do it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $140 is still a bit steep. Could you meet me halfway at $120? That would be a great deal for me, and you'd still make a decent profit.",120.0,Bob,4,
