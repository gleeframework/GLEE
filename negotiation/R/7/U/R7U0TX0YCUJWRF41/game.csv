"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I believe this product holds even greater value for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. I feel this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to see a bit more movement on the price to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000, but that's my final offer. It's a significant discount and a fair deal considering the value you'll gain.",890000.0,Alice,5,
