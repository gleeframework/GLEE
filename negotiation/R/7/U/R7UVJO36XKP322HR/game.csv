"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $15,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we perhaps agree on $10,000? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.",10000.0,Bob,4,
