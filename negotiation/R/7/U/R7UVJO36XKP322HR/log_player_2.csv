"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate and see if you can get a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a low offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $8,000, we signal that we're serious about the purchase but expect Alice to meet us somewhere in the middle. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite and explains that the initial price is unrealistic for our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down, $15,000 is still above your $10,000 limit. There's room for negotiation.
* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:**  By rejecting, you signal that you're serious but need a lower price.  

You'll need to counter with an offer that moves closer to the middle ground between her price and yours."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $15,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we perhaps agree on $10,000? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Your Limit:** You're now offering your maximum price. This shows Alice you're serious but sets a firm boundary.
* **Justification:**  You're clearly stating this is your top limit, managing Alice's expectations. 
* **Encouraging a Decision:** By putting forward your best offer, you're pushing Alice to make a choice: accept a profitable deal or risk losing the sale."
