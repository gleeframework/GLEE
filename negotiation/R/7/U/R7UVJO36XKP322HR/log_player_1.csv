Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $15,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we perhaps agree on $10,000? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.
