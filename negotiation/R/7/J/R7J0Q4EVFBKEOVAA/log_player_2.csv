"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $1,000,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to  make a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal, I'm confident it's a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his $800,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  He might be able to convince Alice to come down further or he can always choose to buy from John if the price doesn't improve."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's meet halfway again.  $887,500 is a fair price that considers both of our needs.  This is a final offer from my side, so let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $887,500 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might dig in her heels, and Bob could end up paying more than he wants.  Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product for his target price, minimizing his risk."
