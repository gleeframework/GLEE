"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't justify spending more than $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
