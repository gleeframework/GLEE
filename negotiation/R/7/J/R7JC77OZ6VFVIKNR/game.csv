"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $825000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750000. This feels like a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. This is a great opportunity for you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
