Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a starting point that allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and it's not worth accepting it. While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, it's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob. There's potential to get closer to your desired price by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that is closer to your desired value. It leaves some room for further negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your desired $1,200,000. It's not worth selling for $900,000 when you know you can potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer demonstrates a further willingness to compromise while still seeking a price closer to your desired value. It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations have reached a point where Bob's offer is close to his perceived value of $800,000, and there's a high chance of continuing to stalemate. There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, and it's likely the next counteroffers will be very close in value, resulting in a long and tiring negotiation process. 

Selling to John guarantees a significant profit and is the most sensible choice at this point."
