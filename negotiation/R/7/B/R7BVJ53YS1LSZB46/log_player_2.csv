"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $10,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price. You can also use the threat of buying from John as leverage."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm!  While I do see value in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $9,500 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than my maximum. I'm willing to risk a bit more negotiation to see if I can get a better deal. John is still a reliable option if things don't work out with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm ready to purchase it right now. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to give up on getting the best possible price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above my maximum price point of $10,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't be able to agree on a price.  It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John at the guaranteed price of $10,000."
