"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $850,000? This price reflects the value of the product and still allows you a decent margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds value for you, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $775,000? That's a significant move from my initial offer.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $775,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $825,000. This would give you a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can finalize this.",825000.0,Alice,5,
