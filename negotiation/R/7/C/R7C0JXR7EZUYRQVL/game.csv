"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me at $130, but I'm still not comfortable with the premium. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $130 and $135. How about $132.50?",132.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go up to $132.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $135, but I'd like to propose $132.75. It's a small increase, but it's still a good deal for both of us, don't you think?",132.75,Alice,9,
