"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for significantly less from John.  There's no need to even make a counteroffer yet - he has more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $850,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He has more leverage with John as a fallback option, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $950,000? I believe this price is fair and would allow us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $1,000,000. This price allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice has been unwilling to budge significantly, and he's now at the point where he's better off going with the guaranteed lower price from John.  He's already spent several rounds negotiating and it seems unlikely Alice will drop much further."
