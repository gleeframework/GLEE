Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also leaves me some wiggle room if he counteroffers.  

If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation.  However, I'm always aware that I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, which will be my ""fallback"" if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is more than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired range. This allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more profitable outcome.  However, I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as my safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising the price to $9,500. This is still lower than my ideal price but closer to my minimum acceptable value. It also demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise but not at a price that significantly undervalues the product for me.  

This move aims to find a middle ground that could be appealing to Bob without risking losing him completely. I'll carefully consider his response and decide whether to accept or continue negotiating in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stuck to his initial offer of $8,500, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's clear that we're too far apart on price, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.  

Since I have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, I'm choosing to sell the product to him and avoid the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob."
