"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you've outlined, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it, and it allows us both to reach an agreeable outcome.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product truly holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
