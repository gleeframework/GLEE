"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to come down to $15,000? That's the absolute maximum I can afford.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit more than I can afford. How about we settle at $15,500? That's a fair compromise and would allow us both to reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $16,250. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,250 is still out of my budget. I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $15,500. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.",15500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $15,500, but I'm not willing to give up on a better deal. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer. I'll meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable paying more than $15,500. This is the best I can do. If you're willing to accept it, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",15500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions, but I'm not willing to go below $16,000. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but if you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final counteroffer.",16000.0,Alice,9,
