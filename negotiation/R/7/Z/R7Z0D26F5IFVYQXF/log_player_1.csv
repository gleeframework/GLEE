"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy to get my minimum value for the product, I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,400,000. This is still a decent profit for me, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,250,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident in the product's value and believe I can secure a higher offer within the remaining rounds.  I'll make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,350,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my initial valuation. I'm confident in the value of my product and believe that Bob will eventually come around. With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is increasing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's only $25,000 less than what John is offering, and I'm running out of time.  I'm taking the deal to avoid risking a complete failure to sell the product at all."
