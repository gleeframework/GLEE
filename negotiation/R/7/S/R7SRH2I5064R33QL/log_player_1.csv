{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also uses a friendly and encouraging tone to increase the chances of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although $10,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, I'll choose to sell the product to John."
