"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,100,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price still represents a good value for you, while also taking into account the unique features of this product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised on the price by offering $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My next offer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product, but also reflects my financial limitations. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. My next offer is $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal here.",920000.0,Alice,7,
