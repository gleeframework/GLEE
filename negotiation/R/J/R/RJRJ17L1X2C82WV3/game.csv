"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",9000.0,Bob,4,
