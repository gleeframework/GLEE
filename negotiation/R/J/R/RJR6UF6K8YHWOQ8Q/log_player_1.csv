"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm interested in making a deal, $1,300,000 is too low.  I need to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,450,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  We've reached a point where it seems unlikely that Bob will meet my minimum asking price, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation rounds. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the best option for me at this point."
