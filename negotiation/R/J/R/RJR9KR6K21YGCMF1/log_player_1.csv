Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still earning $150,000 more than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **It's appealing to Bob:** The offer is significantly less than the value of the product to Bob ($1,000,000), leaving him with a good profit margin.
* **It mitigates risk:** While there's always a chance Bob rejects the offer, you've significantly increased your odds of making a sale compared to demanding the full $1,000,000."
