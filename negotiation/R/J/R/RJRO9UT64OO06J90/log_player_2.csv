"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  $9,000 is more than your maximum price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

I'm offering Alice $7,500 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and within my budget. I hope she finds it reasonable enough to start the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum price. I'm going to try and negotiate further."

I'm offering Alice $8,000, which is my maximum price. Hopefully, she'll accept, but if not, I'll have to consider buying from John in the next round."
