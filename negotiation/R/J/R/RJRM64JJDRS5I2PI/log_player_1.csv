"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $750,000 is still a good amount, it's below my minimum value for the product.  
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my target:** I'm hoping to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob don't work out, selling to John ensures I get my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise: I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $825,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $825,000 is very close to my minimum value of $800,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk running out of time. 
* **Selling to John is still a backup:**  If I need to, I can still sell to John for $800,000. 

Since I'm close to my goal and the risk of losing the deal to time is high, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best strategy."
