"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You're looking to spend no more than $800,000, and she's offering $1,200,000. It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating. You have a solid alternative with John, so you have leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product, and it's a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still higher than your preferred price. You're still within your rounds, and you have a solid backup option with John. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good compromise given our current positions. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is still above your preferred price of $800,000. You've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiations, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to budge much further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to purchase the product from John for $800,000 and save yourself the further hassle of negotiating.  You have a guaranteed deal with John and can avoid risking further rounds of potentially unsuccessful negotiations."
