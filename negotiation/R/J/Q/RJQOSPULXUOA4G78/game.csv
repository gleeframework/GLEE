"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product, and it's a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good compromise given our current positions. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product.",980000.0,Alice,5,
