"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  However, I believe the value this product brings warrants a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
