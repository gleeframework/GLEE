"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's compromise and settle on $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $1,087,500.  This is a good compromise, and it gives us both a chance to make this deal work.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,087,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market conditions and the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique value. I hope you'll accept and we can close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market conditions and the product's value.",975000.0,Bob,8,
