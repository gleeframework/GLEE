"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my valuation and the potential benefits.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.  It's worth the risk to counter and see if we can negotiate closer to my range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both."",
