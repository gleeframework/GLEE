"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $20,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $15,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20,000 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product and would be happy to pay $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $17,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
