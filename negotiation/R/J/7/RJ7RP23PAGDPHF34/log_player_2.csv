"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he can get the same product from John for $15,000.  There's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $20,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $15,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $18,000 is better than $20,000, Bob can still get the same product for $15,000 from John. There's no reason to accept this offer yet. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product and would be happy to pay $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $17,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has come down to $17,500, which is still higher than Bob's maximum.  It's clear Alice isn't willing to go any lower, and John is offering the product for a price that Bob is comfortable with. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
