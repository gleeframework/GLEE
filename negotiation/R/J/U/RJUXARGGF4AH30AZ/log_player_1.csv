Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $175. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  Starting with a price of $175 offers a reasonable markup without being excessively high. This gives you room to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests you're open to discussing the price, giving Bob the opportunity to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. 
 
Let me know what Bob's response is!"
