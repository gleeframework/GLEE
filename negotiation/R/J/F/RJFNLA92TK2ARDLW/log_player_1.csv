"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its exceptional value.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not convinced that it's worth $1,400,000 to me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is more than what John is offering, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm confident the product is worth more to him than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $1,300,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,300,000, so I'd like to offer $1,200,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is closer to my goal, I still believe there's room for negotiation, especially considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to offer $1,225,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to $1,300,000, Bob seems to be firm at this point.  Accepting his offer of $1,225,000 is a good deal considering we are almost halfway through the negotiation rounds and the risk of losing him completely."
