"Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its exceptional value.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not convinced that it's worth $1,400,000 to me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can you consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $1,300,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to negotiate.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,300,000, so I'd like to offer $1,200,000. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to offer $1,225,000. Can you consider that?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
