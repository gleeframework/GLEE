I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also leaving room for negotiation, but I won't go below my minimum price. If Bob rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and decide if it's worth negotiating further. If it's too low, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my original offer.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm ready to walk away if it isn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is only $500 below my last offer.  It's getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by being too stubborn.  I'll accept and move on."
