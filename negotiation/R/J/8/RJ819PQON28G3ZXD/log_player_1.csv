Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you get more than John's offer if Bob accepts.
* **Create Urgency:**  By offering a high but potentially acceptable price, Bob might feel compelled to accept before you move on to John."
