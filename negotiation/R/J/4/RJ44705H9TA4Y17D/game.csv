"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in or if you'd like to negotiate further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a significant offer, but I'm still looking to get as close to the product's true value as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1225000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in or if you'd like to negotiate further.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1225000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit you'd still make. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1100000 is a good compromise, but I'm still looking to get as close to the product's true value as possible. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you the product for $1175000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the profit I'd still make. Let me know if this is something you're interested in or if you'd like to negotiate further.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
