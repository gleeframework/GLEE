"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $14000? It's a compromise, but I think it's worth considering.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $14500? It's still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13500 again, but I'm not sure how much further I can go. Would you be willing to consider this price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. How about we try $14200? It's a small step closer to my target price, but I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",14200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid $14200 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I may need to consider buying from John for $12000. Can you really make this work for $13000?",13000.0,Bob,8,
