{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price depending on Bob's response and your confidence in selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his valuation, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. You have room to negotiate a better price, and you also have the option of selling to John.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,500 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would allow both of us to get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate while still maintaining a price above your minimum. 
* **Reasoning:** Providing a clear reason (meeting in the middle) makes your counteroffer more persuasive.
* **Room for negotiation:** You still have some room to adjust your price depending on Bob's response. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum. You're not obligated to accept his offer, and you have the option of selling to John for a significantly higher price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired value, or even potentially get a better price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to secure this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate further while still maintaining a price above your minimum. 
* **Clear Reason:** Providing a clear reason (value of the product) makes your counteroffer more persuasive.
* **Small Increment:**  The small increment from your previous offer signals you're getting closer to a deal, but still have some room to maneuver if Bob wants to counter again."
