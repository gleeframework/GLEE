"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,500 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would allow both of us to get a fair price.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close the deal at this point.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to secure this product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
