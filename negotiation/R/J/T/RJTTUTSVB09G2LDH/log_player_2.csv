"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can save $250,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate.  While $950,000 is less than the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's still room to bargain and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $950,000. This counteroffer reflects Bob's desire to save as much money as possible while still remaining within his budget. It also leaves some room for negotiation, as Alice likely won't accept this price immediately but it's a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still a significant amount of money that Bob could save by continuing to negotiate. There's still room to bargain and potentially get a lower price, especially since Alice has already rejected Bob's counteroffer. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is still the worst-case scenario, so continuing to negotiate with Alice makes the most sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $875,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise. However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's last offer of $900,000, leaving room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to find a price point that's mutually beneficial and avoids having to purchase from John at a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $885,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation would be protracted and may not yield a significantly better price.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's still within his budget and significantly lower than what he'd pay John. The risk of continuing the negotiation is that Alice might become less willing to compromise or that the process could drag on, ultimately leading to a worse outcome for Bob."
