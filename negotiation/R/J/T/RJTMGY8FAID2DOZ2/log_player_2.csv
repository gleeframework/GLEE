"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's worth rejecting and counteroffering to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I do see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer (nearly 30% below Alice's asking price) shows Bob is serious about negotiation while still leaving room for potential compromise. This aggressive starting point also pressures Alice to be more flexible in her own counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $9,500 is too low for me. This product is truly top-of-the-line and worth every penny.  Would you consider $12,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $12,000 is still too high for Bob.  It's worth rejecting this offer and counteroffering again to try and get closer to Bob's preferred price range.  This also gives Bob a chance to assess if Alice is serious about negotiating or if she's unwilling to budge from a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're asking for a fair price.  $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and Bob's initial counteroffer. It demonstrates Bob's commitment to finding a deal while still staying within his budget.  It also creates a sense of urgency by highlighting that this is a ""serious offer,"" potentially pushing Alice to consider accepting."
