Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, the negotiations seem to be stuck.  It's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  To avoid getting caught in a longer negotiation with no guarantee of a better price, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at this point. He's guaranteed the product for a price that's within his budget."
