"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's still a significant profit for me.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is a good price, I believe I can do better. I have a few more rounds to work with, and I can still sell to John for $15,000 if necessary. Let's see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's still a decent deal for Bob.  If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
