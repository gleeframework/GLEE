"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $70, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $82? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $85. It's still a great deal considering the product's value. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for it.",85.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think we can do better than that. How about we try $80? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget.",80.0,Bob,6,
