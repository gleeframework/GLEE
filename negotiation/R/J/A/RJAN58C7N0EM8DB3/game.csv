"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $8,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $8,000.",8750.0,Alice,5,
