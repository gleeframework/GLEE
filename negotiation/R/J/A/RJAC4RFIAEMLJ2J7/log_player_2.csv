"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $60. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Since the product is worth $80 to you, a price of $60 is a good deal. However, you're aiming to save as much money as possible. You can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $60 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $55? "", ""product_price"": 55}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $65. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is moving in the right direction, but $65 is still too high.  It's worth trying to get closer to your target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  Let's split the difference - how about $60?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 60}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slight discount. I'll sell the product to you for $62. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $62
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is now offering a price that's very close to your target.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower. Accepting this offer means saving $18 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount."
