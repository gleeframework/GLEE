Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this valuable product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you insight into how badly he wants the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
