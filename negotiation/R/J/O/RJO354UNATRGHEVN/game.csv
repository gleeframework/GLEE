"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. Can we discuss this further?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? I believe that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer the product to you for $12,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value it brings to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,250, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not getting close to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at $12,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can avoid any further negotiations. Let's make this happen!",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made significant concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you one last chance, but I need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'll offer the product to you for $13,500. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope you'll take it.",13500.0,Alice,9,
