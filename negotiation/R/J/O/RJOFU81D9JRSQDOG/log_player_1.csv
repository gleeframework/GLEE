{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum value of $12,000, but I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still well below what I could get from another buyer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $9,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum value of $12,000, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a sale to John for $12,000.  It's a good compromise that allows me to move forward with the sale."
