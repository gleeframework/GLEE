"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of offering $8500 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to be mindful of my finances. I'm thinking of offering $9800 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,5,
