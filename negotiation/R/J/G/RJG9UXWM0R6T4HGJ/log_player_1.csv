Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a strong offer aims to secure the maximum possible profit from Bob, who values the product significantly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price still well above your minimum.
* **Time Value & Alternative:** Acknowledging Bob's priority (""before I list it publicly"")  creates a sense of urgency and reminds him of your secured alternative buyer (John). 

This strategy aims to balance assertiveness with the potential for a win-win negotiation."
