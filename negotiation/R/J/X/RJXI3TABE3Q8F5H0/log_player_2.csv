"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Consider this a chance to get a deal that's worth every penny.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, John is also selling the same product for $1,000,000.  There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer since I can get the same product from John.  Therefore, I'll buy from John."
