"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I appreciate your perspective on the value, $900,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground - would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,050,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $1,175,000.  This offer reflects my bottom line.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
