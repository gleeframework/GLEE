Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Motivating Language:**  I'm using positive and encouraging language to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at my minimum value, leaving room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Back-up Plan:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can we meet in the middle at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I'm not desperate to sell. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, giving me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $10,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,500?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not going too low yet, keeping my minimum price in mind and utilizing the knowledge that I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $9500. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, and I'm not willing to go above $9000. Can we try to get closer to my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firm on his price of $9,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation with Bob will likely result in a lower price and consume valuable time. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed profit and secures my desired outcome.  

**Conclusion:**

It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale to John at a much better price."
