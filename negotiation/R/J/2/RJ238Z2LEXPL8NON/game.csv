"Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a great price for a product worth $100 to you, and it gives me a fair margin. Let's work together to find a deal.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $105. How about we split the difference and settle at $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
