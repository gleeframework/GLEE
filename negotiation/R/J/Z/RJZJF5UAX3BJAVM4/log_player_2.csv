# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. There's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice if you reject her initial offer."
