Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. Since you have a fallback option with John, you can afford to be a bit more assertive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's worth trying to get closer to that by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $95. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $92 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price.  John is a guaranteed sale at $100, so it's the best option to maximize your profits."
