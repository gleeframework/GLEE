"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute maximum I can offer for the product.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I can accept and still make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
