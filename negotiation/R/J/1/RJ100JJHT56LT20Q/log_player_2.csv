"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than John's offer. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now very close to John's price, but we're still aiming for the best possible deal.  We'll reject this offer and propose something slightly below John's price to see if we can get it for a steal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute maximum I can offer for the product.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

We're pushing our luck a bit here by offering a price slightly below John's. However, this strategy might work for two reasons:

* **Urgency:**  Alice might be motivated to sell quickly and avoid losing the sale entirely.
* **Relationship Building:** By being transparent about our budget and showing a willingness to compromise, we might encourage Alice to do the same."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I can accept and still make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm above our budget and John's offer is a sure thing. It's time to cut our losses and go with John to ensure we get the product at the best possible price."
