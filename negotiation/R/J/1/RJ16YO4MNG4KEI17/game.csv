"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your budget, $8,000 is quite a bit below my asking price.  Could you do $11,000? That's a significant reduction on my end.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, $9,500 is getting closer. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,5,
