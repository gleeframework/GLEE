You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your budget, $8,000 is quite a bit below my asking price.  Could you do $11,000? That's a significant reduction on my end.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're right, $9,500 is getting closer. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than her current offer, and it's better to secure the product from John at your target price than risk further negotiation."
