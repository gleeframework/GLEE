"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850,000? I appreciate your understanding.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This would still be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not able to reach $875,000. Could we perhaps aim for $860,000? I believe this would be a reasonable compromise for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,
