{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's best to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This sets a clear boundary and shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial one, it's still above my budget. I'll reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but still staying within a reasonable range. It's likely Alice will counter with a price between $1,200,000 and $1,700,000."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is still above my budget.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,400,000. This is a significant move closer to Alice's last offer, but it still gives me some room for negotiation.  If she rejects this offer, I'll be ready to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and I've already made several counteroffers.  It's unlikely we'll reach a deal that's within my price range. I'm better off buying from John and getting the product for my maximum budget."
