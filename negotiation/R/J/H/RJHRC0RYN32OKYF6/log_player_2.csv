"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, Alice is offering the product for $900,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  You're not desperate to buy from Alice, so you can use John's offer as a benchmark."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer 875000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than you'd like to pay.** While it's closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.
* **You want to keep pushing for a lower price.** You can likely get closer to your target of $850,000 by rejecting the offer and continuing to counter.
* **You have time to negotiate.**  You have 7 rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a decision. You're in a better position than Alice, as you have the option of buying from John if the deal falls through."

Round 7
Alice's offer:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to your target price.**  You're only $5,000 away from your desired $860,000 price. 
* **You're running out of time.**  You have 3 rounds left.
* **The risk of going to John is significant.** If you keep rejecting offers, you might end up paying $1,000,000 for the product.

While it's not ideal, accepting the offer at $865,000 is a good compromise. It's a fair price considering the product's value to Alice and your willingness to pay."
