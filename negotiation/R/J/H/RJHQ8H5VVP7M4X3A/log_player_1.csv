"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, knowing it's below Bob's perceived value but gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a good tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By starting a bit high, I allow for a back-and-forth and potentially reach a price closer to my goal of $150. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John's offer of $120 gives me confidence to negotiate, as I can always walk away if the deal doesn't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is Still Higher:**  While $130 is a good price, my goal is still to get closer to $150.
* **Negotiation Power:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I show I'm not desperate to sell and have more leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer:**  I believe I can make a counteroffer that will be more appealing to Bob while still being within my desired price range.
* **John is Still an Option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me confidence to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I can't meet you exactly at $130, I'm willing to come down to $135. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to make this deal work.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly tone, reminding Bob that I want to make this deal work.
* **Reasoning:**  I give Bob a reason for the price, emphasizing fairness for both sides. 
* **Potential for Closure:**  $135 is a good compromise and may be the price that closes the deal. 
* **John is Still the Backstop:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer to Goal:** $132 is a good compromise and puts me within striking distance of my ideal price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to consider closing the deal, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Risk of John:** While John is a safe option, I'm confident that I can close the deal with Bob at this price, increasing my profit. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** By building a good relationship with Bob, I may be able to secure better deals in the future."
