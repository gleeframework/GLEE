Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Aiming for a higher price gives me the chance to earn more than my minimum.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  A higher starting price allows for some room to negotiate if Bob is interested but wants a lower price. 

It's a calculated risk, but by starting high, I increase the possibility of earning a greater profit."
