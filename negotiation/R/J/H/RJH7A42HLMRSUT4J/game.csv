"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $25000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $22000. I think this price still represents a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $22000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $18500.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",18500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're still a bit apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $20000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think this price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the time we've already discussed. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $19000 for the product. This is a good compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for me.",19000.0,Bob,6,
