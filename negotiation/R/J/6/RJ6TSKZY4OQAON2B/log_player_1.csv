"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a special introductory price of $200. It's a steal!"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think $150 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is his maximum valuation of the product.  It's better to take John's guaranteed offer of $150 than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting a lower offer or no deal at all."
