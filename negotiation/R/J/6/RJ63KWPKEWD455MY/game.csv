"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I agree that this product is valuable, but I'm looking to be a bit more budget-conscious. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further discussion.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $812,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",812500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made.  To avoid wasting more of your time, I'm willing to meet you at $800,000.  This is a very fair offer considering it's the same value you place on the product.",800000.0,Bob,8,
