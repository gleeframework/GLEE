"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that amount.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to make a deal, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it will bring to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm counteroffering at $950000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it will bring to you.",980000.0,Alice,5,
