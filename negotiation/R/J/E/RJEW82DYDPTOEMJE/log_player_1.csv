Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum acceptable price:** I need to make at least $1,000,000 to consider the sale worthwhile.
* **Potential for higher profit:** By offering $1,500,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation and the possibility of making a larger profit.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While a higher offer increases the chance of rejection, it also offers a greater potential payoff.

This strategy attempts to balance my need for a good return with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
