"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $95 is a decent price, it's not the best possible deal.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a great price for a product worth $100 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $90 is better than $95, it's still above his ideal price point. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his desired price of $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $89.  It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has already gotten the price down to $89, which is very close to his target price of $85.  At this point, it's likely that Alice won't come down further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
