"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is still a bit low for me. How about $115? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",115.0,Alice,3,
