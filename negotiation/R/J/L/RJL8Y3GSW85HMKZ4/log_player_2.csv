"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $120 is more than your target price. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
You're still over your budget, and there are still rounds left to negotiate.  It's worth continuing to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 
You're getting closer to your target price.  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice you're serious about buying but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $105 is still slightly over your ideal price, it's only $5 more. You've already invested several rounds in negotiation, and continuing to haggle might not yield a significantly lower price. You're also nearing the end of your negotiation rounds. It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product now."
