"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am currently working within a budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still allows for a significant profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,325,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,337,500. This seems like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's get this deal done!",1337500.0,Alice,5,
