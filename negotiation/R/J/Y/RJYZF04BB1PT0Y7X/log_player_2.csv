"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price. You can afford to spend up to $100, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low just yet.  How about $90? That's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $90 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay, and you still have several rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $90 is still a bit too high.  Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  That seems fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```"
