While holding out for more is tempting, accepting Bob's offer of $825,000 is the most logical decision at this stage. Here's why:

* **Exceeds John's Offer:**  Bob's offer is $25,000 higher than John's guaranteed $800,000.
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob has been consistently increasing his offers, indicating a willingness to make a deal.
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging negotiations further risks losing the opportunity cost of selling to John now. 

Taking the $825,000 secures a profit above your minimum and avoids the uncertainty of future rounds."
