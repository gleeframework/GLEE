"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree there's a lot of value in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true market value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the value this product brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for coming up. I'm seeing a path to a deal here, but $1,100,000 is still a touch low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
