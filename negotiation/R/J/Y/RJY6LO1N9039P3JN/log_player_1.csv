Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting with a higher price of $12,000 gives you a cushion. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob finds $12,000 too high, there's a chance he'll counter-offer, giving you an opportunity to still sell above your minimum price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message subtly implies the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. It's possible Bob will reject the offer outright. However, since you have John as a backup buyer, you're not at risk of losing your minimum desired profit."
