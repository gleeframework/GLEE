"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $1000000. This is a limited-time offer, and I believe it presents a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is below your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  However, it's still quite high considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This allows for a good profit margin for both of us while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with a price of $950000. This still offers a good profit margin while considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and within my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice might not budge further, and I risk losing the deal. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids the potential of having to buy from John at a higher price."
