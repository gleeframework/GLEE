Explanation: 

Bob has consistently made low offers and seems unwilling to meet at a reasonable price point. He's also employing pressure tactics by declaring ""final offers.""  At this stage, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome than $870,000. Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures you get your product's full value and avoids further haggling."
