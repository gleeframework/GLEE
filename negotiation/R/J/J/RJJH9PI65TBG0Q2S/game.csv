"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. But $950,000 is still below what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $925,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $950,000.  How about we compromise at $940,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
