"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. To continue our discussion, I propose we aim for a price closer to the midpoint of our current offers. How about $13,750 for the product?",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
