"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is starting at $14,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, and there's room to find a lower price that works for both of you. 

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice. You should aim for a price closer to your maximum value of $15,000, but leave some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable range considering your maximum value of $15,000 and her value of $12,000.
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** This counteroffer demonstrates that you're serious about buying the product but are also willing to negotiate.  
* **Opens dialogue:** The accompanying message invites Alice to discuss further and potentially find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $13500.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, and this offer is within your budget.
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially result in a lower price, but it risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price.

**Next Steps:**  You've secured a good deal, and it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult. You're saving $1,500 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving."
