"Hi Alice, thank you for meeting me halfway with the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $16000. I'm willing to pay up to $14500 for the product. Would you be willing to accept that price?",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I think $14500 is still a bit low. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15200.
