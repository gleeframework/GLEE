"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  How about $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $125 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit higher than your target price, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about we meet at $132? It's the lowest I'm comfortable with, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",132.0,Alice,5,
