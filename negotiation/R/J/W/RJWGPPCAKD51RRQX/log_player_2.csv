"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $950,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. You have room to negotiate down to $800,000 (or even a little higher) before you'd be better off buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get Alice to come down further, especially since she rejected your previous counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is now only $85,000 more than her bottom line of $800,000. It's highly unlikely she'll go lower, and continuing to negotiate risks ending up with John's price of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product at a reasonable price."
