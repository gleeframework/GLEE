Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, hoping to entice Bob without sacrificing too much. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell the product for less than $12,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $11,000 is still too low. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering you the product for $11,500.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
