Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering you the product for $11,500.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, $11,500 is a reasonable compromise. I save $500 compared to John's offer and avoid the risk of Alice increasing her price in later rounds."
