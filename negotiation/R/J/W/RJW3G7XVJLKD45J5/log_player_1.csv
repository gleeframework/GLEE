Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without losing the sale. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation."
