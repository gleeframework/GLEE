{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, she should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting Alice closer to her $1,200,000 guarantee.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning another interested party (John) creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
