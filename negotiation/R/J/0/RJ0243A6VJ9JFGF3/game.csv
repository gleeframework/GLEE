"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product with significant potential. While I understand the value is subjective, I'm asking for $1500000. This price reflects its worth and the benefits it can provide. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price, but I also have another interested party, so let's discuss this further. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this price is fair considering the current market conditions and the potential benefits of the product. I look forward to your response.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800000 is significantly below what I consider a fair price for this product. Given its potential and the value it offers, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. I'm confident this price is still attractive to you, especially considering the potential returns.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, while I appreciate your efforts,  $950000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1050000.  This price still offers significant value to you, considering the product's potential.  Let's try to bridge this gap and reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I understand the value proposition of the product, but I'm still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1000000. This price aligns closely with your last offer and represents the maximum I am willing to pay. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
