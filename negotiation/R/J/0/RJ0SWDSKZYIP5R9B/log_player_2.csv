"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's best not to accept the first offer. Alice is starting high, and there's room for negotiation. I can definitely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Show Interest:** I want to signal that I'm genuinely interested in the product, but not at any cost.
* **Gauge Reaction:** This counteroffer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $12,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to my price range, but I think I can still get a better deal. It's worth another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but it's still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,250? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** By suggesting $11,250, I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between my last offer ($10,000) and her current offer ($12,500). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Maintain a Target:** My goal is still to get as close to $12,000 as possible. This counteroffer keeps me moving in that direction.
* **Time Consideration:** While I have time, it's good to make steady progress and avoid getting stuck in a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  $11,250 is closer, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,875?  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** Alice's offer of $11,875 is very close to my target price of $12,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a very small additional discount. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Alice could become less flexible in later rounds. Accepting now secures a good price. 

While I could potentially save $125 by going with John, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are likely to be small, and there's a risk the deal could fall through.  This offer represents a good balance of savings and certainty."
