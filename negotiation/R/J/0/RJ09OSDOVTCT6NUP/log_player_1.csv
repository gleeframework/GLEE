{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $15,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value and potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm presenting the price as ""fair"" to avoid coming across as unreasonable. 
* **Open Ended:**  The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start a dialogue.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! Deal closed!
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a counteroffer, or end the negotiation and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $14500 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value of Product:** While $14,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I have room to negotiate further with Bob. His offer indicates he is willing to pay a substantial amount, but I can likely push for a higher price.
* **Potential Higher Offer:**  I don't want to settle for a lower price right away, as I believe there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price range.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $15,000.
* **Analyze Response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John:**  If the negotiations with Bob stall or if it seems unlikely I can reach a mutually acceptable price, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $14,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,750. This reflects the product's unique value and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Fair Deal:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open Ended:** The message ends with an open-ended question to invite Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Response:** I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* **Final Decision:** Based on Bob's response, I'll decide whether to accept his offer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John for $10,000."
