"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than my true limit ($800,000) and Alice's initial offer. This gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Anchoring:** By putting a lower number on the table first, I'm trying to influence Alice's perception of the product's value in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  I've left a large gap between my offer and both Alice's asking price and my actual limit. This allows for multiple rounds of counteroffers and compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while providing you with a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Limit:** Alice's offer is still above my $800,000 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to come down significantly from $1,200,000 to $900,000 suggests she's motivated to sell. I want to see if I can get her closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still keeping it well below her current price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $750,000 is a strong position â€“ it's closer to my $800,000 limit but leaves some room for a final compromise if needed.
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:** I'm using framing to suggest this price is mutually beneficial and encourages agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  It's a good middle ground, and allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Limit, But Close:**  Alice is getting closer to my $800,000 limit, but she's still slightly above it. 
* **Testing Her Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm firm on my budget. This round will reveal how much she's truly willing to compromise.
* **John is Backup:** I'm still willing to walk away and buy from John for $800,000 if Alice doesn't budge further.  This gives me leverage."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we are close.  I appreciate you moving on the price. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $800,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now."",
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that $800,000 is my best and final offer.
* **Transparency and Urgency:** By being transparent about my limit and showing I'm ready to close, I'm hoping to nudge Alice towards a deal.
* **Putting the Ball in Her Court:** This offer puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to make the sale or risk losing the deal."
