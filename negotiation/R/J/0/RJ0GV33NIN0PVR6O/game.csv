"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while providing you with a valuable asset. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  It's a good middle ground, and allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are close.  I appreciate you moving on the price. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $800,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",800000.0,Bob,6,
