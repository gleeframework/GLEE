"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",16000.0,Alice,3,
