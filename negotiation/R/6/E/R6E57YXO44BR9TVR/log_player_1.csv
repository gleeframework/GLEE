{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130:** This is a price that is higher than Bob's valuation ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that is close to my minimum (worth $150 to me) but still appealing to Bob. By starting at $130, I leave room for negotiation without immediately alienating him.  This allows me to see if he's willing to pay more than his initial assessment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, and I believe I can get closer to my goal by counteroffering. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our desired prices.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate for a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $90 is lower than my initial offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$110:** This price is a compromise between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($90).  It shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** This message acknowledges Bob's offer while remaining firm on my own price.  It also reiterates the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the compromise.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150) while still being attractive to Bob.  By offering a midpoint, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while also maintaining my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  I believe I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer closer to $110.  I'm confident that a small adjustment could lead to a mutually agreeable price, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. How about we meet at $105?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$105:**  This price is a small compromise from my previous offer ($110) and is a very close to Bob's offer ($100). This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** This message reiterates my willingness to compromise while emphasizing the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to remain firm but also show flexibility. By offering a price that is a small step closer to Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement. My hope is that this small adjustment will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal."
