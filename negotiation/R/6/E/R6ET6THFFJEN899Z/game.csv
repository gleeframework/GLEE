"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $125? Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. How about we compromise at $135? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $130. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $140? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still above my budget.  Let's try $135. This is a fair price that's in the middle of our last two offers.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",135.0,Bob,6,
