"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $150, and I'm willing to make a deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While the product is worth $150 to you, her initial price of $180 is a significant markup.  It's better to start the negotiation by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $155 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 155}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $165. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it's a bit more than your initial offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $165 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go to $160. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $162.50. It's a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $162.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $162.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down further, $162.50 is still higher than my target price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway. I'm willing to go to $163, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $163. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $163
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While we're getting closer, Alice's offer of $163 is still higher than I want to pay.  We've only got 3 rounds left, and I'm not sure we'll be able to close the deal. 

To avoid risking the deal falling apart, I'm going to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $150.  It's a guaranteed deal at my target price, and I'm happy with that outcome."
