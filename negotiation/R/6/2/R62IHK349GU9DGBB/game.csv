"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $150, and I'm willing to make a deal today.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $155 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",155.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $165. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it's a bit more than your initial offer.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $165 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go to $160. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",160.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $162.50. It's a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",162.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. How about $161? I'm really hoping to finalize this deal today, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",161.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway. I'm willing to go to $163, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",163.0,Alice,7,
