"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm glad to hear you're flexible. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000. How about $12,200? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12200.0,Alice,5,
