"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a worthwhile investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",11500.0,Bob,4,
