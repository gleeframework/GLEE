"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $1,500,000 by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I think $1,150,000 is a fair price for me. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I'm offering $1,150,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I need. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob in the hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get this product, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $1,150,000 is still quite a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is the lowest I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's becoming increasingly clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,500,000, I don't want to risk losing a guaranteed sale to John.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
