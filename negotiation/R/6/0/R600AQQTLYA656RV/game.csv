"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $18,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with another seller.",12000.0,Bob,4,
