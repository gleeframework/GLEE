Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (You'll sell to John at this price if Bob declines).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your reservation price, you have leverage.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but within reason:**  This offer starts near the upper end of the ZOPA, aiming to capture as much value as possible.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal""  frame the offer positively.
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the ""significant returns"" Bob will experience emphasizes the product's worth.

**Important Notes**

* **Be prepared to negotiate:** Bob may counter-offer. Be ready to adjust your price slightly, but don't go below your $1,500,000 reservation price.
* **Don't reveal John's offer:**  Keep your backup option secret to maintain negotiating strength."
