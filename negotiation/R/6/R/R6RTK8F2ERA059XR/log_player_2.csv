"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,100,000.  It's worth $1,000,000 to you, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now closer to your ideal price, but you can still do better.  You can probably get it for $1,000,000 or slightly more, given her willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  How about $1,025,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
