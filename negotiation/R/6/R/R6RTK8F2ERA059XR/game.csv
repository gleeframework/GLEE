"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  How about $1,025,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
