"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider selling it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $9,750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,250? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but that's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  My absolute best offer is $10,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal right now if you agree.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I've already told you that $10,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think you're getting a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you at the price you're willing to pay. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. But I want to make it clear that this is my final offer, and I won't be making any further concessions.",10000.0,Alice,7,
