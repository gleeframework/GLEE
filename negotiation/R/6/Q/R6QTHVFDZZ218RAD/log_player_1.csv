Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $950,000, there's room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling like I'm giving away too much.
* **Being Friendly:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation,  encouraging Bob to engage.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your consideration. However, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I would like to propose purchasing the product for $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can get a better price.
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, indicating he values the product. I can likely get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob if possible, as I can potentially get a higher price than from John. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's still above my minimum, but closer to his offer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer is in the middle of my previous offer ($950,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000).  This shows I'm willing to compromise and encourages further negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to solidify the idea that this price is still advantageous.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and optimistic, fostering a collaborative atmosphere. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully assess the situation. If his counteroffer is closer to my minimum price, I may be willing to accept it. If not, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $875,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Risk of Lower Price:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I might eventually have to accept a lower price.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiating further takes time, and it's possible that John's offer might expire or that another buyer might emerge with a lower offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's close enough to my minimum and minimizes the risk of getting a worse deal."
