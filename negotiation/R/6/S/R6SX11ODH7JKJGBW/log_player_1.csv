Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Not Too High:**  Offering the product for slightly less than its value to John ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a significant profit if Bob accepts.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the ""unique value and potential"" aims to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking for Bob's thoughts and not making it an ultimatum, Alice keeps the conversation open and allows for counter-offers.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable potentially losing the deal with Bob. If Bob rejects the offer, she still has a guaranteed sale to John.
* Negotiation is key. Alice needs to be prepared to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob pushes back, but she should aim to keep it above her minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
