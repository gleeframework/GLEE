Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start high to maximize your potential profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** The $1,300,000 offer leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle on a price higher than your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing your absolute bottom line, making the offer seem more reasonable.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you might choose a different approach."
