"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and closer to the value you place on the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. That being said, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you at $825,000.  That's a significant jump on my end, and I'm hoping you can see it as a show of good faith to close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $825,000, which would be $837,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",837500.0,Alice,7,
