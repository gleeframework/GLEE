"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $800,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000, which is still a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
