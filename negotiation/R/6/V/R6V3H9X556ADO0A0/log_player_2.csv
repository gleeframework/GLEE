"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first.  $110 is too high, but there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this to me, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you consider $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$115 is still too high, and there are still rounds left to negotiate a better price. We can try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $115 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $110? I'm confident this will be a great product for me, and I'd like to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $115, so how about $112.50? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be really happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $112.50 is closer to our target price, there are still a couple of rounds left. We can try to negotiate a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $112.50 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a price a little lower.  Would you be open to $111?  I really think this is a fair deal for both of us, and I'd like to close this today."", ""product_price"": 111}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $112, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is already at $112, which is just $2 more than our target price of $110.  We have a few rounds left, but there's a chance she might not budge further. It's probably better to accept and close the deal now, as getting another $2 off might not be worth the risk of losing the deal."
