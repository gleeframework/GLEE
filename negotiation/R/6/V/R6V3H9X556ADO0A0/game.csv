"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this to me, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you consider $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $115 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $110? I'm confident this will be a great product for me, and I'd like to close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $115, so how about $112.50? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be really happy with the product.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $112.50 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a price a little lower.  Would you be open to $111?  I really think this is a fair deal for both of us, and I'd like to close this today.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $112, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,7,
