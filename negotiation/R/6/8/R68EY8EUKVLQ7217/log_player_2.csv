"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm offering it at a price of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than John's price, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might prompt Alice to lower her price, getting you closer to your desired spending limit."
