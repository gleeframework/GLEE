Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value and the potential benefits it holds for your business.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above your budget of $1,000,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant discount and would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a good value for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your budget.
* You have 7 rounds left and there's still potential to negotiate a better price. 
* Although John's offer is $1,000,000, it's still worthwhile to continue negotiating with Alice as you might be able to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I can pay. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your stance, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's a price that allows me to at least partially recover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above your budget of $1,000,000. 
* You have only 5 rounds left, and it's unlikely you'll be able to convince Alice to drop the price further.
* John is willing to sell the product for your budget, so buying from John is the most efficient and guaranteed way to acquire the product without exceeding your budget."
