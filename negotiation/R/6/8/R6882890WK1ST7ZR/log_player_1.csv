"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value and the potential benefits it holds for your business.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant discount and would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm still hopeful to reach a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a good value for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I can pay. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it still falls short.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to push the price a bit higher. There are still 6 rounds left, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations don't go in my favor."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your stance, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's a price that allows me to at least partially recover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
