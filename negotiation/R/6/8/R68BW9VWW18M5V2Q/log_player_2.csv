"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $10,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to try and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy it now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget than the previous $9,500 offer, it's still above his desired price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8875? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $8,875 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $8,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative of buying the product from John for $8,000, it's in his best interest to take that option and avoid any further negotiation with Alice.  This ensures he gets the product at his desired price and avoids the risk of potentially exceeding his budget."
