"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* $9,000 is a great price, but it's always worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get an even better deal. 
* You have a safety net with John's offer of $15,000, so there's no risk in trying to get a lower price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,500.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $7500, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8250. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is already willing to compromise, which is a good sign. However, $8,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.
* I'm still comfortable rejecting this offer because I have John as a backup. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
