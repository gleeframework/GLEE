Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price and allows for potential negotiation. I'm confident that this price is appealing to Bob, while still giving me room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still represents a good profit for me.  I believe this price is more appealing to Bob, but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might not be fruitful. I'm confident that this is a good outcome for both of us."
