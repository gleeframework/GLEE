While we could push Bob further, accepting $1,800,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still nets a $300,000 profit over the minimum we'd accept from John.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations on risks losing Bob altogether. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has stuck around and come up to this price twice now. It's likely close to his maximum."
