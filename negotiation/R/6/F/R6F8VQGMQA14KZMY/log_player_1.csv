Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.  
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Offering the product at $135 gives you the potential to earn $15 more than selling to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob finds $135 a bit high, this initial offer opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially still settle on a price higher than $120."
