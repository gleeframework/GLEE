Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a good compromise, reflecting the value you'll get. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

It's time to switch tactics.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000 and you have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice."
