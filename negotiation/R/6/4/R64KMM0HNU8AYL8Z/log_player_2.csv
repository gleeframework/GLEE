"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $900,000 is less than $1,200,000. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:** Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, you're getting it for $900,000, which means you're saving $300,000."
