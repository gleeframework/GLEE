Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a good deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm willing to discuss the price further. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and respond accordingly. If he doesn't come close to my desired price, I'll either make a counteroffer or end the negotiation and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $9,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. While he's closer to my minimum price than his initial offer, there's still a gap. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I want to see if I can push Bob further before considering selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my desired price, but still leaves room for potential compromise. If he rejects my counteroffer, I will consider selling to John if his offer remains the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a good price for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Appeal to value:** I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal.
* **Urgency:** The message suggests a sense of urgency to close the deal, hoping to motivate Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John.  While I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob, I'm aware that his budget constraints may prevent him from getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm getting closer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation with Bob may take time and effort without a guarantee of a better offer.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and ensures a quick and hassle-free transaction. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to go with the guaranteed profit and sell to John.  While I would have liked to get a better price from Bob, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential gain."
