"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $11500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, considering the product's value and the fact that I'm already meeting you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,7,
