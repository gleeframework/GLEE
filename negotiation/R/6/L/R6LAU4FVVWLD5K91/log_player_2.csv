{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $950,000 while still leaving room for negotiation. This is a reasonable starting point, and it leaves space for a potential compromise to be reached."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your ideal price, it's still too high. You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's still room to lower the price further.  Rejecting allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer but still lower than Alice's current offer.  It demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway, making it more likely Alice will accept and leading to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum price. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate. The risk of continuing is that Alice might further increase the price. Buying from John, even at a higher price, guarantees you the product without the risk of further negotiation and potential price increases."
