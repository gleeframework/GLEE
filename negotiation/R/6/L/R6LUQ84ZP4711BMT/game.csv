"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're excited about the product, but $250 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I can't go higher than $120 at this point. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $250 is a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $200. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $200 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm happy to pay $140, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $200 and $140, which would be $170. This is my final offer. Let me know if it's acceptable to you.",170.0,Alice,5,
