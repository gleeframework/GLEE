"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,500, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try negotiating a lower price first before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

This counteroffer aims to establish a lower starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's opening but still leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000, as I believe this product is worth more. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer. Let's see if we can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $11,500. Would that be possible?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to a price that works for us while acknowledging Alice's concessions. This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit too low.  How about we compromise at $12,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is getting close! We are just $500 away from our ideal price. It's worth one more try to see if Alice will budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate that.  How about we settle this right now at $12,250? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 12250
}
``` 

This message does a few things:

* **Acknowledges the progress:** We want Alice to know we appreciate her willingness to negotiate.
* **Presents a strong but fair offer:** $12,250 is a good compromise, splitting the difference between the last two offers.
* **Creates a sense of urgency:**  By calling it our ""final offer,"" we signal that this is it â€“ encouraging Alice to accept.

If Alice rejects this, we might be better off accepting her $12,500 offer in the next round rather than risk running out of rounds and having to go with John's $15,000 price."
