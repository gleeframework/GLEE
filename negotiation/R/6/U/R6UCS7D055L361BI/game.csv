"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can consider a price of $16,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I think this is a fair compromise and would love to hear your thoughts.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $16,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer the product to you for $15,500, which is only $500 more than your offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate.  I'm willing to move up a little bit from my last offer. How about $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up from your last offer. I'm still not quite ready to accept $14,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $15,000, which is the same price John is willing to pay. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,7,
