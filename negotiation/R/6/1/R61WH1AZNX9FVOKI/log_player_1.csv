"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition,"" subtly suggesting the high price is warranted. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I want Bob to understand I'm willing to negotiate, fostering a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Alternative Option:**  The fact that I have another buyer (John) at my minimum price gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  His opening counteroffer being exactly at my minimum suggests he might be willing to go higher.  I'll aim to gently nudge him upwards in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  It demonstrates your understanding of the product's value.  To be frank, $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,900,000? This would represent a significant commitment from both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I begin by showing Bob that I respect his offer and see its logic. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Standing Firm (For Now):** While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I don't want to concede too quickly. Aiming for the middle ground between our current positions is a common negotiation tactic.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the compromise as a ""significant commitment"" from both sides, emphasizing that I'm also making a concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we try $1,700,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, signaling he's willing to negotiate further.  While $1,700,000 is a tempting profit, I'm aiming for at least $1,800,000. I'll make one more counteroffer before potentially accepting if he's unwilling to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,800,000? This represents a fair deal for both of us, providing you with this valuable asset and me with a suitable return on my investment."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is my attempt to secure a slightly higher price. I'm aiming for the midpoint between our last offers.
* **Framing the Deal:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of this price for both sides.  This emphasizes the mutually beneficial nature of the agreement.
* **Decision Point:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept his previous offer of $1,700,000 in the next round. Prolonging the negotiation further might not yield much more, and I risk losing him as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm counting on getting a good deal, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I was aiming for $1,800,000, Bob's counteroffer of $1,750,000 is reasonable. It's a significant profit margin above my minimum, and further negotiation might not yield a much better outcome.  It's time to close the deal and secure a successful sale."
