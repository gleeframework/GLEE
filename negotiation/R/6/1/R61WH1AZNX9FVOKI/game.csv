"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  It demonstrates your understanding of the product's value.  To be frank, $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,900,000? This would represent a significant commitment from both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we try $1,700,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,800,000? This represents a fair deal for both of us, providing you with this valuable asset and me with a suitable return on my investment.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm counting on getting a good deal, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
