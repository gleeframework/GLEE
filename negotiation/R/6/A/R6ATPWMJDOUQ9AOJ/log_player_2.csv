"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay.

I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so I'll propose a price of $1,300,000. This is a compromise, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.
