"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you, and it's the best I can do at this point."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, it's still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John or going through more rounds of negotiation."
