Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115.  It's a great deal for something worth much more! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'll see if I can get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to meet you halfway at $110. I would like to stick to my original proposal of $100 for the product. If this is not feasible, I will consider purchasing the product from John for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is being stubborn and I'm not sure I can get him to move on price.  While I'd rather get more than $120, I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer, and I'm better off selling to him and moving on."
