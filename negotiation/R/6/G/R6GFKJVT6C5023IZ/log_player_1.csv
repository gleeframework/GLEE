Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Testing the waters:** A price of $19,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he accepts, you've made a significant profit. If he rejects, you can always lower the price or move on to John.
* **Confidence:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which might make Bob more amenable to a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize profit, but don't get greedy and risk losing the sale altogether."
