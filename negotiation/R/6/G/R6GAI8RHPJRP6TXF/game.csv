"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product, recognizing its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $725,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $710,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price.",710000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $710,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not ready to accept it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $720,000.
