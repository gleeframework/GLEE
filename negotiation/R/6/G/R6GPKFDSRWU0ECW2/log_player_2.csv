"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1250000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1150000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1180000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

Alice has come down to $1,180,000, which is a good deal for Bob considering his maximum budget is $1,200,000. It's better than the $1,200,000 he'd pay John, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
