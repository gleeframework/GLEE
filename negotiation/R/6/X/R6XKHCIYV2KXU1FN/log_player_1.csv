Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great fit for your business. My initial price is $1,750,000. This reflects the product's quality and potential. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his own valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  I have 10 rounds and can potentially negotiate a higher price.  Rejecting his offer keeps me open to getting closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, recognizing the value this product brings to your business. I'm confident this price is fair and allows both of us to achieve a successful outcome. Let's see if we can close this deal in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,400,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's still not quite there.  I have several rounds left, and I want to see if I can push him a bit further.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and hopefully close the deal closer to my ideal price.  Selling to John right now would guarantee me $1,500,000, but there's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your effort to come closer to my price. However, $1,400,000 still falls short of what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it allows both of us to secure a win.  Let's make this deal happen in this round.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,425,000. I hope this proposal will be more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in round 6, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While there are four rounds left, the negotiations seem to be reaching a stalemate.  Each counteroffer is getting progressively smaller, and there is a risk that the negotiations will continue to drag on without a mutually agreeable price.  

Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further potential delays or a worse outcome."
