"I understand that $1400000 is a significant reduction from the initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
