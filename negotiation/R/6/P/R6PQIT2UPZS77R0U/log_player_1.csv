Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate over.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob before you have a guaranteed sale with John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of the surplus as possible, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to your business."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, which is still a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""careful consideration"" and ""fair deal,"" you're framing the price as well-thought-out, not arbitrary.
* **Focus on Bob's Value:** Highlighting the ""potential worth to your business"" subtly reminds Bob of what he stands to gain.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,150,000. He might counter-offer, in which case you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or stick with your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
