"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",97.5,Alice,5,
