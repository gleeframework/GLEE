Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can get more from John. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob, but I won't settle for less than $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $100 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $95.  I really want this product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
