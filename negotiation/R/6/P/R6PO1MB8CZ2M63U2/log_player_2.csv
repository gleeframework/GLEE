Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $980,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's worth considering other offers. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is $50,000 more than my previous offer. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise here. While I understand your position, that final concession doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to make one more push at $1,000,000.  This ensures you get a good price above your value, and I get the product at a reasonable level. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a premium support package, which would normally cost $50,000. This way, you'll get an even better deal than the $1,000,000 offer. I think this is a fair and reasonable price, and I'm willing to stand by it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice didn't meet my target price of $1,000,000, she's clearly firm on her stance and is now adding value with the warranty and support package.  These extras likely offset the $50,000 difference and make this a reasonable deal. It's better to accept a slightly less ideal price now than risk the negotiation failing completely and having to buy from John at a much higher cost."
