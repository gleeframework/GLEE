Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves space for potential counter-offers while staying well above your minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John allows you to aim higher with Bob."
