"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering your previous offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. This is a compromise that I hope we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $10,200, the product is still within Bob's budget and significantly cheaper than buying from John. This is a good compromise that saves Bob money."
