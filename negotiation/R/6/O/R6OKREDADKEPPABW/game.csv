"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a good value for you as well.  Let's see if we can find common ground here!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This way, we both can get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,6,
