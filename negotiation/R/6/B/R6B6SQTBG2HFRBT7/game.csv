"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This price is still above your value for it, and it allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer the product to you for $9,200. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,700. This price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,700 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to accept it. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $9,100. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9100.0,Alice,5,
