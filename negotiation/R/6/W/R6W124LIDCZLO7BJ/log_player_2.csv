"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than your target price. It's worth trying to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,250.  This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's work together to make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my target price of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if I can get her down closer to my target."
