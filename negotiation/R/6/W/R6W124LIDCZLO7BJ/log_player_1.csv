{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a price that's attractive to Bob while still earning a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted by the $8,500 offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by countering Bob's offer. I'll likely offer a price slightly above Bob's current offer, aiming for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,250.  This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,250 is closer, I'm still only comfortable with paying $8,750.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I'm not willing to continue negotiating and risk ending up with an even lower price.  John is a sure thing, and I'd rather sell to him and secure the $12,000."
