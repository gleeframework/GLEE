"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1000000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1075000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. ",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1075000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1075000 and $1150000, so I'll offer $1012500. Can you consider that?",1012500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above $1012500.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'll offer you the product for $1043750.  That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1043750.0,Alice,5,
