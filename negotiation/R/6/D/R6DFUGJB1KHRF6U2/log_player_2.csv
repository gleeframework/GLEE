"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's work something out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get the price closer to his $800,000 target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.

Let's meet in the middle!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is my final offer.  This price allows for a significant profit for you, while still ensuring a fair return for me.  I believe this is a mutually beneficial solution that allows us to finalize this deal.  If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to move on to another buyer.

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's a good deal for Bob, he can get the product from John for $800,000.  It's better to save the extra $200,000 and go with John's offer."
