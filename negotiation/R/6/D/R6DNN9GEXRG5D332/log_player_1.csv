"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000, which is slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. This will give me some room for negotiation if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It also keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable value. There's no need to risk further negotiation as I can secure this price with Bob."
