"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting high, at $170, knowing that Bob values the product at $120. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is more than I'd like, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130, which is still above Bob's offer but a significant decrease from my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a more attractive price for Bob while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more favorable price. I'm still hoping for a better deal, but I'm also starting to consider the possibility of selling to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $125, which is just $10 above Bob's last offer and only $5 below my minimum.  This is a serious offer, and I hope Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'll start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than risk another round of negotiation with Bob."
