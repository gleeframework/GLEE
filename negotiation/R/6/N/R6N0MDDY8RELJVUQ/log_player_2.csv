"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still higher than the $1,200,000 John is willing to sell it for.  You can save a significant amount of money ($200,000) by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
