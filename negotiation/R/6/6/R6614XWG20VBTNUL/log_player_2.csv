"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You can definitely do better than $7,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $7,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you consider $6,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $6,800, which is a decent price, considering you're willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Accepting this offer would save you $1,200 compared to buying from John."
