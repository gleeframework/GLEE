"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  A counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it. This aggressive counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially push Alice closer to his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $725,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than he'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially get a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, so Bob has time to try and push Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to gradually close the gap with Alice. A counteroffer of $710,000 is only $15,000 less than Alice's latest offer, showing a willingness to compromise. This could potentially convince Alice to accept, especially as the rounds are ticking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $730,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $730,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved up from her previous offer, but it's still below Bob's maximum budget. Accepting the offer at $730,000 allows Bob to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with, while also saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  With only 5 rounds remaining, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to Alice becoming less willing to compromise, potentially resulting in a higher price or a failed deal. Accepting the offer is the most strategic choice in this situation."
