Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a high baseline and leave room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob than $800,000, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium. 

If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a slightly lower price, but I won't go below my minimum of $800,000. I'll also consider John's offer of $800,000 as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my initial offer of $1,000,000, and it's significantly more than my minimum of $800,000. Accepting his offer is a good outcome, as it allows me to secure a decent profit without risking further negotiation."
