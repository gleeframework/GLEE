Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the potential benefits to him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm stating that this is a ""starting point,"" explicitly indicating I'm open to negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives me confidence to negotiate firmly. If Bob rejects my offer, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. This aligns better with my budget constraints. Please let me know if this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's willing to negotiate.  I can use this to my advantage and try to secure a better price in the next round.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to meet you halfway. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer to Bob, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing my counter-offer as a ""meet you halfway"" compromise to encourage Bob to see it as a reasonable step forward.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating that the product is still a ""great deal"" at this price, emphasizing the value to Bob. 
* **Open to Agreement:** I'm ending the message with a call to action, expressing a desire to reach an agreement.

**Note:** While I'm confident in my position due to John's offer, I'm still trying to get the best possible price from Bob. This counter-offer demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $9,500. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your ability to meet my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has remained firm at $8,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, which is far more profitable than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks delaying the sale and potentially losing out on other opportunities.  

It's important to prioritize my financial goals and secure the best possible price.  Selling to John is the most sensible decision in this situation."
