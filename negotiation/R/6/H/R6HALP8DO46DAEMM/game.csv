"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. This aligns better with my budget constraints. Please let me know if this revised offer is acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to meet you halfway. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $9,500. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your ability to meet my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,4,
