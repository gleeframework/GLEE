"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This is a common strategy in bargaining. 
* **Enthusiasm:**  The message expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob and encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $18,000, I allow for a potential compromise without immediately dropping below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is right at my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to earn more, the risk of further negotiation is high. I don't want to lose the deal entirely, especially since John is also offering the same amount. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees the sale and secures my minimum desired profit."
