{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my target price, I've already pushed her as far as I can.  It's clear that she won't go lower than $10,000, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds. At this point, buying from John for $8,000 is the best option to ensure I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
