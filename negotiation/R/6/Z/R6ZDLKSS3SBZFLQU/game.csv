"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 for it right now.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $12500? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product provides. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
