Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. I also want to leave some room for negotiation in case he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm offering $8,500. This is halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer, so it's a fair compromise. I hope Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer is the best option for me, as I'm able to sell the product at my minimum price and avoid any further negotiation."
