Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation. I believe this price is fair, given the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to take his offer, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I will counteroffer and try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer to show flexibility but still holding firm to my minimum. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise and gives Bob a better deal while still allowing me to earn a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's clear we are unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
