"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her $80 value."
