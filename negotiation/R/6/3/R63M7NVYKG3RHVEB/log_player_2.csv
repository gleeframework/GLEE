"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $100.** This is above your maximum budget of $120.
* **John's price is $120.** This is also above your maximum budget, but it's the best option you have if you reject Alice's offer.
* **By rejecting Alice's offer, you are signaling that you are willing to pay $120.** This opens up the possibility for Alice to counter-offer with a price closer to your budget."
