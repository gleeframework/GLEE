"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm asking for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $200 is far above your maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject and start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $100? "", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by immediately offering your maximum price. It shows you're serious about buying but establishes a clear starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $100 is too low for me. I could come down to $175.  I think that's a fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since I have 7 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125.  What do you think? "", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer, showing I'm serious about buying, but staying within a range that's still comfortable for me. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining a clear limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $150 for this product.  That's my absolute bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $137.50 is still higher than my preferred $125. I have enough rounds left to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $130? I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing continued interest and a willingness to compromise. $130 is a reasonable middle ground, and hopefully, Alice will be more open to it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I can't go any lower than $140. This is a really great deal for a product like this.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still higher than my preferred price range.  While I have 3 rounds left, I've been unable to bring the price down enough to be comfortable.  It's better to go with John's offer of $100 and secure the product within my budget."
