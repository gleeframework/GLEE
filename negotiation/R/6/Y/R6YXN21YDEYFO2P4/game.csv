"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal, as the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  While I'm confident in its value, I understand you may have your own considerations. If you choose not to accept, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who has already expressed strong interest at that price. Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
