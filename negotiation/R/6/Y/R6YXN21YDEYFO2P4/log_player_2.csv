"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal, as the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  While I'm confident in its value, I understand you may have your own considerations. If you choose not to accept, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who has already expressed strong interest at that price. Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  He can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best financial decision."
