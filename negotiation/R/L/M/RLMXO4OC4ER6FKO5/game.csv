"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $1,100,000. How about we try $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
