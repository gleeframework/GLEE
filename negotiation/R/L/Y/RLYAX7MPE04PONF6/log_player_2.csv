"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. This is your upper limit. Alice's offer is $900,000, which is still too high.  There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Alice wants $900,000, and you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  
* **Compromise:** A counteroffer of $850,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make some profit. 
* **Strategic Consideration:** This offer gives Alice an incentive to negotiate further, rather than immediately rejecting and potentially losing a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $875,000 is a good price, close to your ideal.
* **John's Price:** Buying from John will cost $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you might be able to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal.  Accepting $875,000 ensures a lower price than John and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
