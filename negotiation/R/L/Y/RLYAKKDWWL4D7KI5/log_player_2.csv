"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above his ideal target. It's worth exploring if he can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer that's still within the range of Alice's value (remember, Alice values the product at $10,000). This sets the stage for a negotiation where both parties might be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price below $11,000.  He has some room to negotiate further and could potentially get a better deal without needing to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,750?  That's closer to my target and still a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's last offer, but still below his ideal target. This shows a willingness to compromise and potentially motivates Alice to come closer to his price."
