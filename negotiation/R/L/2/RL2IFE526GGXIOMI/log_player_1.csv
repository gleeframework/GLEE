{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the final two rounds, and Bob's offer of $880,000 is only $5,000 away from my previous counteroffer.  There's a good chance that we won't be able to close the deal if I reject his offer again.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept his offer and secure a sale. While I hoped for a higher price, it's still a good deal, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $800,000."
