"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $10,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you consider $12,000?

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $16,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to your $15,000 minimum.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the sale with John."
