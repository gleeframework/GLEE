"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking for something closer to $800,000. I believe we can find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 falls significantly short of the product's true value. To move this forward, I can offer it for $1,900,000.  This reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Could we meet somewhere around $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to see a bit more movement to make this worthwhile for both of us.  How about we settle on $1,650,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000, which is closer to the value you're offering and within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
