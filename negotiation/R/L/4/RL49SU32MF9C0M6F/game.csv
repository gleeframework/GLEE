,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but  $1,000,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,200,000. How about $1,100,000? This is a good midpoint between our previous offers.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise here.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point.  Would you consider $1,175,000? This keeps us moving toward a deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
