Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for your product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
