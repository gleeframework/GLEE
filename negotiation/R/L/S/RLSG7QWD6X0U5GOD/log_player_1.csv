Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant profit for you:**  You'll make $200,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's still attractive to Bob:**  He'll save $200,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can make counteroffers, potentially getting closer to your ideal price. 

Remember, the key is to balance getting a good price with maintaining Bob's interest in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. Can we meet in the middle at $930,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $930,000 is a good compromise.  While it's slightly lower than my ideal price, it's still a significant profit for me and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a lower offer or even a deal falling through.  It's also close enough to Bob's perceived value that he's likely to accept."
