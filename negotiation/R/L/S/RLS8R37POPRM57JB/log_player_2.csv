Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob. However, $80 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $100.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it makes more sense to cut your losses and take that deal."
