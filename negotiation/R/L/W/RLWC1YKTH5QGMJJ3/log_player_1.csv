Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,150,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to my minimum ($1,200,000) than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  The message frames the price as a ""fair starting point,""  signaling I'm open to negotiation but also confident in the product's value.
* **Alternative Option:** I have John as a backup buyer, which allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and my initial offer. While I want to maximize profit, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. It's more strategic to counter-offer and continue negotiating. I'll aim for a price closer to my range while still leaving some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous positions. Would you be willing to discuss a price of $1,025,000?"", ""product_price"": 1025000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but with Strength:** By stating that $900,000 is ""too low to consider,"" I reiterate my position that his offer is significantly undervalued. Offering to meet ""halfway"" shows a willingness to negotiate but keeps the price significantly closer to my target. 
* **New Anchor Point:** $1,025,000 becomes a new psychological anchor, moving the negotiation away from Bob's low initial offer. 
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:** I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, giving me leverage to walk away if Bob doesn't move closer to a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer slightly, it's clear he's unwilling to move significantly closer to my acceptable range.  His latest offer of $950,000 is still substantially less than my minimum of $1,200,000.  

At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a satisfactory outcome. I'm better off taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, rather than investing more time and effort in a negotiation with a low chance of success."
