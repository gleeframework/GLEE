"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $14,000. I think you'll really love it and I'm confident it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $15,000.
* Alice is offering it for $14,000, which is still within your budget.
* However, you can get the product from John for $15,000.
* It's always better to pay less, so you should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price with her, or buy it from John if you are happy with that price."
