"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't drop below my minimum price of $15,000.  I'll see if I can get closer to that amount with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
