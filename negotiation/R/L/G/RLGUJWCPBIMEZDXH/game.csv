"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe I can find something similar at a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better one elsewhere. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $16000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $15000? I'm sure we can find common ground.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I truly appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget constraints. However, I am unable to agree to $16500. Could you perhaps reconsider and offer a price closer to $15000? I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Bob,6,
