"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value at this price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to make a slightly larger profit margin.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This still gives you a good return and leaves room for me to make a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire for a larger profit margin, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which would still give you a substantial profit.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,120,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value at this price. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
