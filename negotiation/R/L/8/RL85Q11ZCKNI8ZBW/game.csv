"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential.  However, I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $800,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll derive from the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit more than I had budgeted. How about we settle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $925,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible. While I understand your position, that final offer is still a little too high for me.  I can go up to $975,000.  Hopefully, that works so we can get this deal done.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $975,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,012,500. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
