"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,400,000 is higher than Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, giving him some room to negotiate. 
* **Below your minimum:** $1,400,000 is still above your minimum of $1,500,000, leaving you room to potentially negotiate down if needed. 
* **Direct and concise:**  Clearly communicates the offer and leaves the ball in Bob's court.

It's important to be aware of the following:

* **John's offer:** Remember, John's offer of $1,500,000 is your safety net. This means you can always stop negotiating with Bob and go with John if the deal doesn't work out. 
* **Bob's potential counter-offer:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide whether to accept his counter or make a new one based on his offer and how many rounds are left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial Loss:**  Selling for $1,100,000 would mean losing $400,000 compared to my minimum acceptable price and $300,000 compared to John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There are still 8 rounds left.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price that is more beneficial for me while remaining competitive."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, recognizing your interest in the product.  This price still reflects its value, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,300,000 represents a compromise. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer of $1,400,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:** I emphasize the product's value to reiterate its worth and justify the price. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I highlight the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement to encourage a collaborative negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Remaining Above Minimum:** $1,300,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This provides me with a cushion and a greater chance of reaching a satisfactory deal. 
* **Potential for Agreement:**  This counteroffer is more realistic for Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept or at least make a more reasonable counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer and proceed accordingly. Depending on his reaction, I may need to adjust my strategy for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't compromise on my principles.

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial Loss:**  Accepting this offer would mean losing $350,000 compared to my minimum acceptable price and $350,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are only four rounds into the negotiation process. I have time to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I will aim to find a price that is closer to my desired price while still being competitive. I need to strike a balance between getting the best price possible and ensuring that I don't run out of time before reaching a deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I can accept. Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000.

```

**Explanation:**

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  $1,250,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, providing a buffer. 
* **Improving Position:** This counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's previous offer, potentially making it more attractive to him.

**Next Steps:**

I will continue to evaluate Bob's responses and adapt my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer, I will have to decide whether to continue negotiating with him or take John's offer of $1,500,000, considering the number of rounds remaining."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,180,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has slightly increased his offer to $1,180,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for a significant financial loss, especially with several rounds remaining. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial Loss:** Accepting this offer would mean losing $320,000 compared to my minimum acceptable price and $320,000 compared to John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  With four rounds remaining, there's still time to negotiate a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,180,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - $1,215,000.  This is a fair compromise considering our previous offers.  We're getting close to a deal, let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1215000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Emphasize Progress:**  I highlight that ""we're getting close to a deal"" to encourage Bob to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I reiterate the ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  $1,215,000 is a significant increase from Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We only have three rounds left.  I need to start closing the gap between our offers.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully evaluate Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I will have to decide whether to continue negotiating with him or take John's offer of $1,500,000. With only three rounds left, the pressure is on to reach a deal, but I won't settle for a price that is too low."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,215,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my maximum budget. I hope we can finally reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's not enough to make up for the potential loss I would incur.

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial Loss:** Accepting this offer would mean losing $300,000 compared to my minimum acceptable price and $300,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** We have two rounds left. While it's getting late, there's still time to negotiate a better price, especially considering Bob has stated he's at his maximum budget.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I will aim for a price slightly above Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise, but not giving up on a better price. I need to strike a balance between getting the best price possible and ensuring that I don't run out of time before reaching a deal."
