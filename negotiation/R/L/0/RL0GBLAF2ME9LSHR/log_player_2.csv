"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth discussing a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high. You can likely get a better price. Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above what you're willing to pay. You have more rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making concessions, $11,500 is still a bit high for you. You have several rounds left and can likely push for a lower price. It's worth trying to get closer to your target of $10,000 before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000, Bob. I'm making a significant concession by meeting you at $12,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now firm at $12,000, which is higher than what you are willing to pay. You've already made several counteroffers and the negotiation seems to be getting nowhere. With only three rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. 

Buying from John at $15,000 is still within your budget and a safer option at this point. You'll pay more, but you'll avoid the risk of the negotiation breaking down entirely."
