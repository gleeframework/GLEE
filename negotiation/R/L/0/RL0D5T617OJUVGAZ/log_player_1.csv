"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer the product to you for $13,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13250 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13000.  This price would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $13,000 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $12,000. There's a good chance we won't reach a better price in the remaining rounds."
