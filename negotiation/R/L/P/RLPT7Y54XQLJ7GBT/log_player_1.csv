{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum, but it gives Bob room to negotiate and still leaves me with a profit. I'll keep John's offer in mind and be ready to counter any lowball offers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'd like to see if I can get a bit closer to my target price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get out of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,250 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I'm close to my target, I'm not willing to risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate.  John's offer is significantly better and guarantees me the price I need."
