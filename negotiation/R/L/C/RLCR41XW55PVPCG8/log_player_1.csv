"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer provides space for negotiation, allowing Bob to counter without feeling insulted. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message exudes confidence in the product's value, reinforcing the price justification. 

By starting high, we aim to anchor the negotiation in our favor while remaining open to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This aligns more closely with my assessment of the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our target price and his perceived value.  We have room to negotiate and try to bring the price closer to our desired range. 

Here's why we're not accepting or selling to John yet:

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:**  Accepting now would leave a significant sum of money on the table. We believe we can secure a better deal. 
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John is our safety net, but we are still in the early stages of negotiation with Bob.  We have time to aim for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $950,000 falls short of what I believe is fair given its potential and the unique benefits it offers.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $1,050,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory but Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and express understanding but maintain our position that $950,000 is too low.
* **Strategic Concession:** We've reduced our price by $50,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still targeting a price above Bob's initial offer.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price point.

We are aiming for a win-win situation where we secure a strong profit, and Bob gets a product he values for a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to consider $1,000,000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 represents a strong compromise and a significant profit for us. Here's why accepting is the best decision now:

* **Strong Profit:**  A $1,000,000 sale price is well above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and provides a healthy $200,000 profit. 
* **Risk of Pushing Further:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away altogether. We are already in a good position.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate capital that we can utilize for other investments or opportunities.

While we could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for modest additional gain. Accepting Bob's offer at $1,000,000 secures a favorable outcome."
