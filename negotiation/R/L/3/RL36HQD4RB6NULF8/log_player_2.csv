# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the same as John's, there's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting it.  Alice might come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale.  There's no harm in seeing if she'll budge."
