Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, and this offer is a good distance from your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's less than the product's value to Bob:** This gives Bob a chance to feel he's getting a good deal, making him more likely to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust your price if Bob makes a counteroffer.

Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
