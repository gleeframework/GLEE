"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  You have room to negotiate since you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and Alice's minimum is $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for a potential compromise. It's important to be aggressive in the first counteroffer to show Alice you're serious about negotiating.  It's also important to provide a reason for your offer, in this case, it's that you feel it's fair for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise, bringing the price down to $1,100,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what you would pay John and allows you to secure the product.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'd get a lower price, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
