"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is far below what the product is worth to me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a fair profit.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could go up to $6,500, but that's as high as I can go.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints.  While $6,500 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $9,000? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $7,000. That's a fair offer considering I could buy it elsewhere for $8,000.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $7,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8,000? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good price for you considering what the product is worth.",8000.0,Alice,7,
