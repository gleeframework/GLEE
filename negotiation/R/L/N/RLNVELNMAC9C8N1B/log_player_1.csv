"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a good profit.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **First Round Strategy:** I want to gauge Bob's interest without giving away too much. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $5,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000 and far below the value of the product to me.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does show he's interested. I can use this opportunity to counteroffer and try to reach a compromise.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John now would guarantee me $15,000, but it's too early in the negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is far below what the product is worth to me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $10,000, which is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $5,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob that the product is worth more to me, justifying the price.
* **Maintain profit margin:** While $10,000 is a big discount from my minimum, it still provides a profit margin.
* **Building momentum:**  A counteroffer shows I'm serious about negotiating with Bob, keeping him engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could go up to $6,500, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $6,500 is still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000, and I'm not willing to take such a big loss. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob has raised his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate. It's worth exploring if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John now would guarantee $15,000, but I'm not yet convinced that I can't get a better price from Bob. I'm willing to risk it for a potential higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints.  While $6,500 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $9,000? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering $9,000, which is halfway between my last offer of $10,000 and Bob's current offer of $6,500. This demonstrates my willingness to meet him halfway and reach a compromise.
* **Value emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly implying that $9,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Pressure tactics:** By decreasing the offer incrementally, I'm putting pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Still profitable:** $9,000 is still significantly above Bob's offer and allows me to make a decent profit.
* **Staying engaged:**  By making another counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm committed to negotiating with him and haven't given up on reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $7,000. That's a fair offer considering I could buy it elsewhere for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $7,000 is still far below my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.
* **Negotiation still ongoing:** Bob continues to raise his offer, demonstrating his interest in the product. There's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Staying engaged:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and will continue negotiating for a better price.
* **Avoid selling to John:** While selling to John would guarantee $15,000, I'm not ready to give up on Bob. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk it for a potentially higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $7,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8,000? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good price for you considering what the product is worth."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $8,000, which is precisely halfway between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's current offer of $7,000. This demonstrates a clear willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Value emphasis:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value, reinforcing the idea that $8,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Increased pressure:** By consistently lowering my offers, I'm gradually increasing the pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Profitable offer:**  $8,000 is still higher than Bob's offer and brings me closer to my minimum price of $15,000, allowing me to make a reasonable profit.
* **Maintaining engagement:** By offering a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm actively involved in the negotiation and haven't given up on reaching an agreement."
