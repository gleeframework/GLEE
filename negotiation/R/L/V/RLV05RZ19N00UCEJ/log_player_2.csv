"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:**  $11,000 is still lower than what Bob would pay John, and it's closer to Bob's desired price. 
* **Further negotiation might be unproductive:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise but is firm on her bottom line.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or even cause Alice to withdraw the offer entirely.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob rejects this offer and continues to counter, he risks Alice getting frustrated and selling to someone else, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures the product at a price he's comfortable with while minimizing the risk of losing out on the deal altogether."
