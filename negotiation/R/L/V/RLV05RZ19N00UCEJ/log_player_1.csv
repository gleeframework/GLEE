{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer:

* **Starts high:**  I'm aiming for a good profit, but also leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlights the value to Bob:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him strengthens my position.
* **Keeps the door open:** I'm not being aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer. 

I'm confident this offer will get the negotiation going in a positive direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  While I could accept his offer and make a profit, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
