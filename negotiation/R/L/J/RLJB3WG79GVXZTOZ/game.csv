"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to your business, and I'm confident it can significantly contribute to your success. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  This product offers tremendous value, and I believe $1,050,000 is a fair reflection of its potential. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair midpoint between our previous offers. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a price we both feel comfortable with. While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your investment.",1010000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,010,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $980,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value to me.",980000.0,Bob,6,
