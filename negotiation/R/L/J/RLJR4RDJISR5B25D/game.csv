"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's currently worth at least $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential worth to you. I'm confident this product can be a significant asset to your operations. Would you be interested in discussing a purchase price of $1,000,000? This gives you a considerable advantage while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
