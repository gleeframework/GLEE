"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's currently worth at least $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential worth to you. I'm confident this product can be a significant asset to your operations. Would you be interested in discussing a purchase price of $1,000,000? This gives you a considerable advantage while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
