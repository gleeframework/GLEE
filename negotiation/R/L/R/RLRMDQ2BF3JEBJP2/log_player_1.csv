{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer sets a price point that is attractive to Bob, as it is lower than his perceived value. It also leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a potential win-win scenario. However, it still ensures you receive a decent amount, closer to your desired minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, or alternatively, I can secure a guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than his initial offer and closer to my desired price point.  While it's still below my ideal price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale without risking a longer negotiation process that could lead to a lower price or even a missed sale."
