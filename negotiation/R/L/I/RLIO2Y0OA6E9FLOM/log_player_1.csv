Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at $20,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly less than what it's worth to me.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I can do $13,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to continue haggling with Bob for a smaller potential gain."
