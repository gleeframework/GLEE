"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still below my minimum price and offers you a significant profit margin. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows you to make a profit, while giving me a fair return. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to a fair price, but $975,000 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is getting closer to your offer and allows for a win-win situation.  Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your desire to save, but $990,000 still leaves me too far from my minimum. Let's split the difference: I'm offering $1,005,000.  This shows my flexibility and allows us to finalize this transaction. What do you say?",1005000.0,Alice,7,
