"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and could be a game-changer for you. I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000.  I'm confident it's worth far more than that in the long run, given its potential.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. This product could be useful, but I'm only willing to consider a price closer to its actual value.  How about $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. This is a unique item with huge potential upside that I believe you recognize.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has potential, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,400,000 is not feasible for me.  Would you consider $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle – how about $1,150,000? That's a substantial decrease from my original ask and reflects my willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for moving closer.  While $1,150,000 is closer to the mark, I need to see a more significant move to justify not going with another option. Would you consider $925,000?"", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is cutting it too close.  This is my final offer – $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of this product, and I'm ready to finalize the deal if you are. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While she might be bluffing, it's too risky to continue. Accepting her offer would mean overpaying by $50,000. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, making it the more financially sound decision at this point."
