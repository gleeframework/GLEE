"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product at a price that reflects its significant value. I'm asking for $1,400,000. This price is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's potential benefit to your business. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your significant profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  The product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial returns.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's potential, and it allows me to maintain a fair profit margin.  Let's work together to finalize this agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
