"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product at a price that reflects its significant value. I'm asking for $1,400,000. This price is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's potential benefit to your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You should reject the offer and counteroffer a lower price. There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $1,500,000 and is willing to sell it for $1,400,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  The product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial returns.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's potential, and it allows me to maintain a fair profit margin.  Let's work together to finalize this agreement.
