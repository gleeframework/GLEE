"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to haggle Alice down further, accepting the $14,000 offer is the most sensible choice. Here's why:

* **Saves you money:** Buying from Alice at $14,000 saves you $1,000 compared to John's $15,000 price.
* **Secures the product:** Rejecting her offer in hopes of a lower price is risky. Alice might not budge, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price anyway. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a potentially insignificant saving."
