"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the transaction. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below your target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  To make this deal work, I need to get at least $1,300,000. This price is still within the range of what the product is worth to you. I'm open to continuing the conversation, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
