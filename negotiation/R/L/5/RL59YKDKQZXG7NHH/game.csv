"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. This product is quite appealing, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than $1,050,000 to make it worth my while. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $1,225,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
