"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $900,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my price range.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even? It seems like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
