Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is closer to my value than Bob's, giving me more room to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm framing the price as a ""steal"" for Bob, appealing to his perceived benefit.
* **Keeping the option open:** I'm not locking myself into this price.  If Bob rejects, I can counter or go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting it would be a huge loss for me.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:**  I can propose a price closer to my desired value.
* **Maintain leverage:**  It shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **See if he's serious:**  If he's truly interested, he'll likely counter back with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're interested. While $700,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800,000? It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering $800,000, which is the middle ground between my minimum and his offer.
* **Maintain urgency:** I'm still reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him. 
* **Show flexibility:** By lowering my price, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win, highlighting the value Bob gets for the price."
