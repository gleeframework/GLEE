"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product of this caliber, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $825000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and go up to $775000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to pay. Can you consider my offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $775000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $812500. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",812500.0,Alice,5,
