Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is your maximum, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I have in it.

While $1,600,000 is closer to my limit, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,500,000, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll give you a 1% discount, so the final price would be $1,490,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.

This is a good deal for me! It's slightly above my initial limit but well below Alice's initial asking price. I'm happy to accept this offer."
