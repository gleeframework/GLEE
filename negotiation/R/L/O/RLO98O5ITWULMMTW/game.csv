"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"That price is way too high for me, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I know it's valuable to you, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is your maximum, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I have in it.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree on that price, I'll have to explore other options.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is as high as you're willing to go, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,500,000, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll give you a 1% discount, so the final price would be $1,490,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1490000.0,Alice,5,
