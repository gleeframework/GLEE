I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. How about $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit too. I can meet you in the middle at $160. Would you be willing to consider that?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $145, but that's as low as I can go. This is a great product, and I think you'll really love it.",145.0,Alice,5,
