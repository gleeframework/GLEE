{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Given that I have a few rounds left, I'm concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement, and I don't want to risk running out of time. It's better to buy from John at $800,000 to guarantee the purchase and save myself from further negotiation."
