"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750000 is unfortunately too far below my value for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850000. This reflects a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $820000, which is a fair middle ground. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",820000.0,Bob,4,
