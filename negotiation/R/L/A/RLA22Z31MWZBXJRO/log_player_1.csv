With only two rounds left and Bob's offer still below my minimum threshold, I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob, I need to ensure I get the best possible price for the product. John's offer provides me with a guaranteed return on my investment, and it's the most financially sound decision at this point in the negotiation."
