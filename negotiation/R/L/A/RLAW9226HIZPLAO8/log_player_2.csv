"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her ($1,500,000), it's still higher than your maximum budget ($1,000,000). Therefore, you should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's potential to get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm  interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,050,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, signaling your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Strategic Value:**  $1,050,000 is still a good deal for Alice since it's higher than her own valuation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer provides room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it. You can increase the offer slightly in subsequent rounds, but not exceeding your maximum budget of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** Alice's new offer of $1,150,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:** While Alice is showing some flexibility, there's still room for a more favorable price. 
* **Strategic counter-offering:** By rejecting this offer, you can push for a lower price closer to your target.  

It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John. You can counter with an offer closer to your maximum budget and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford right now. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I can secure a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer is a significant step up from your previous offer, showing you're willing to compromise. It also leaves just a small gap between your offer and Alice's previous one.
* **Maximum offer:** It clearly states your financial limit, leaving no room for further negotiation on your end.
* **Focus on fairness:** Highlighting the mutual benefit of the deal emphasizes your seriousness and encourages Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1100000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer the product to you for $1150000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that this price is still a fair deal for both of us, considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stuck to her $1,150,000 price point, and it's clear further negotiation won't bring it down to your budget.  You've shown willingness to compromise, but you've reached your maximum limit. Buying from John at $1,000,000 is the best option to ensure you get the product within your budget and avoid any further negotiation that might stall the purchase."
