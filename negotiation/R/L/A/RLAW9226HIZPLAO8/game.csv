"While I appreciate your offer,  $1200000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm  interested in the product, but I can only offer $1050000 at this time.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $1150000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford right now. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I can secure a valuable product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1100000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer the product to you for $1150000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that this price is still a fair deal for both of us, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
