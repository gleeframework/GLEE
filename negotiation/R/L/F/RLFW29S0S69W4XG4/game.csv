"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $1,075,000. Can you consider that?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
