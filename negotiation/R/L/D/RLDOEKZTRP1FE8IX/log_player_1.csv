"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is a bold move, but it reflects the product's value to me and allows for room to negotiate. I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, as he values the product at $1,000,000.  This sets the stage for a negotiation that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I need to hold firm and counteroffer to protect my interests. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still ensuring I receive a fair price. This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept and allowing us to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's not yet enough. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal within the remaining rounds. I'll counteroffer again to push for a price that reflects the true value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession, but it's a price I believe reflects a fair compromise. It's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be the price that closes the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to consider selling to John to ensure I receive at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're running out of rounds and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not convinced I can get a price I'm happy with. Selling to John guarantees I'll get my minimum value.  It's not ideal, but it's the most secure option at this point."
