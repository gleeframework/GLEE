Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for more room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can always come down in price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is getting close to my minimum, I'm only a few rounds away from selling to John for $10,000. I'm going to try and see if I can get a slightly better price from Bob.  There's still room for a counteroffer and it's worth trying for a higher price."

I'm going to counteroffer with $11,000. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that this shows Bob I'm willing to meet him halfway and will encourage him to accept. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a price that works for both of us."
