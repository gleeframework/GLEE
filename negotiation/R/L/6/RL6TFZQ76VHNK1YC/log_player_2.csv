"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have the option of buying from John for a lower price, so there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget, but closer to your target price. Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further. There's potential to get a better deal with Alice, and you haven't exhausted all your negotiating rounds yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my range, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll throw in an additional incentive - I'll give you a 1% discount on the price, so you'll get the product for $990,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is the best deal so far, and it's below your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While you could buy from John for $1,000,000, this offer from Alice gets you a slightly better price.  You also have a few rounds left to negotiate, but at this point, it's likely Alice won't budge much further, making this a good opportunity to secure the product."
