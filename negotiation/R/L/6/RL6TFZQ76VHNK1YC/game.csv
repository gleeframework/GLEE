"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my range, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll throw in an additional incentive - I'll give you a 1% discount on the price, so you'll get the product for $990,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",990000.0,Alice,5,
