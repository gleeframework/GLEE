Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy Alice should use, followed by the offer:

**Strategy:**

* **Maximum Price:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so that's the absolute maximum he'd pay.
* **Minimum Price:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John.  There's no reason to go below that.
* **The Sweet Spot:** Alice should aim slightly below Bob's maximum to make the offer attractive while still exceeding her minimum.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I'm willing to let it go for $9,900.  This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision soon!"", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Why this works:**

* **Creates Urgency:** The ""limited-time"" aspect encourages a quick decision.
* **Appeals to Value:**  By positioning the offer below Bob's perceived value, it seems like a good deal.
* **Exceeds Alice's Minimum:** Even if Bob declines, Alice is no worse off."
