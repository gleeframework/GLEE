{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  It gives Bob some room to negotiate but doesn't immediately undervalue your product.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You have room to lower the price if needed, but you're still securing a good profit.

It's important to remain flexible and be prepared to counter Bob's offers, but this initial offer sets the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it, but $130 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I want to make a sale, I'm not desperate. I'll counter his offer with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $107.50?  I'm open to discussing this further if you're still interested."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find a compromise there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's try $100.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $100 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to pay $97.50 for it. That's a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $97.50 is still below my minimum desired price, it's getting close, and further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort.  It's also possible that Bob won't budge further.  Therefore, I'll accept his offer and move on."
