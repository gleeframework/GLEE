"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we aim for $8,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's also a fair compromise, and accepting it allows me to close the deal without further negotiation."
