"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This price is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential negotiation range. If he rejects, we'll adjust accordingly, keeping in mind the value of the product to me and the risk of losing him as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows me to explore if there's room for a better deal, potentially increasing my earnings. I'll use the remaining rounds to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit higher than $800,000. This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm also unwilling to settle for his initial price. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum profit goal, and with a limited number of rounds left, it's a good time to accept.  While I would prefer more, securing a sale at this price is better than potentially losing Bob and being forced to sell to John for a lower amount."
