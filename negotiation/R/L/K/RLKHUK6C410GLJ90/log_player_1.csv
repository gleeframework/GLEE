"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $90. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, but I'm still above Bob's offer and closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a slightly better deal. I will reject his offer and see if he is willing to move further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $87. This is getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I believe he may be willing to meet me halfway at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $83
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $83 is only $3 less than my minimum price, and we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting his offer is the best choice at this point, as it's still a better deal than selling to John for $80."
