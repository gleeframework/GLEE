"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price around $9,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is still a little steeper than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. How about we try $8,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",8500.0,Alice,5,
