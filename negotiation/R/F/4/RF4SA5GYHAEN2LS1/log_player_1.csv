Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. 
* **""Great deal considering its value"":**  This phrase subtly suggests the product is worth more than the asking price, making the offer seem even more appealing.

I'm open to further negotiation with Bob, but I'll keep John's offer of $8,000 in mind as a safety net if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than John's offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Bob clearly values the product at $15,000, and I believe I can secure a better deal through further negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to pay $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **""Great deal for you"":** This phrase reminds Bob of the value of the product and reinforces that he's getting a good deal. 
* **""Good compromise"":** This phrase highlights that this offer is a fair solution that benefits both of us.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'll continue to monitor John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to my initial counteroffer of $10,500.  At this point,  it's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's also much better than selling to John for $8,000."
