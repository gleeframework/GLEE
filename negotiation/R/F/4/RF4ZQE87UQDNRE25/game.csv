"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit high for my current budget. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product is truly exceptional and worth a significant investment.  I'm willing to come down to $900000,  which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $900000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to offer $800000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's aim for a final agreement on this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
