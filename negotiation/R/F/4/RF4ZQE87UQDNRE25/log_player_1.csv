"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit high for my current budget. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell now, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable value, and I have 8 rounds left.  I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product is truly exceptional and worth a significant investment.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $900000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to offer $800000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's aim for a final agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get more,  $800,000 is my minimum acceptable value, and it's the same price I can get from John. There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds, so it's best to secure this deal."
