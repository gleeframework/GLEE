Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good middle ground between my minimum acceptable price of $80 and Bob's perceived value of $120. 
* **Positive messaging:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, which will allow me to gauge his interest and potentially adjust my price.

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the possibility of reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is only $10 below my desired price of $100. This is a relatively small difference.
* **Risk of losing a better deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance that he might walk away or make a lower counteroffer.  There's also the risk that John might not be available to buy the product later.
* **Negotiating further might not be worth it:**  Given the potential for losing the deal altogether and the relatively small difference between Bob's offer and my desired price, it's more strategic to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
