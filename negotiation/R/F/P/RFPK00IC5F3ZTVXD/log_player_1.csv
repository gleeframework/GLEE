"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $110. This is likely more than Bob is willing to pay, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if he's willing to budge at all. If he rejects, I'll adjust my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price. I have 8 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm dropping my price to $95. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for him to accept, but still close enough to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  However, we're already on round 4 and I want to avoid having to deal with further rounds of negotiation. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
