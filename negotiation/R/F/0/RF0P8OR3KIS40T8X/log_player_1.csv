* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 is:
    *  Significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you room to negotiate if needed.
    *  Attractive enough that Bob might consider it a good deal if he values the product highly or sees potential for future profit.
* **Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, you create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
