,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - $92.50. It's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",97.5,Alice,5,
