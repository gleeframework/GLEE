"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum value for the product is $120, and Alice is offering it at that price, accepting is the best option. There's no benefit to rejecting and then buying from John at the same price."
