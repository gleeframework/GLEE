"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be open to meeting in the middle at $925,000?  This would still leave you with a significant profit potential, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $925,000 is closer, but I'm hoping to land somewhere closer to $875,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",875000.0,Bob,4,
