"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to negotiation, so I'm proposing $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
