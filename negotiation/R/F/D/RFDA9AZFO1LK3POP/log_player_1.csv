"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,600,000 for this round. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** I'm framing the high price with the product's ""unique value and potential,""  avoiding a purely numerical approach.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, signaling flexibility while keeping my ultimate goal in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. I'll reject his offer to signal that I perceive the product's value to be higher and try to meet somewhere in the middle.  We're only in round 2, and I want to explore if I can secure a better deal before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle? I propose $1,400,000. This reflects the value I believe this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but with a strong stance):** I acknowledge Bob's offer but stand firm that $1,200,000 is too low. By proposing $1,400,000, I'm suggesting a compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value proposition, focusing on the potential benefits for Bob's business to justify the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The ""meet in the middle"" approach suggests flexibility and opens the door for Bob to counter with a price closer to my target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards my minimum acceptable price, but it's still too early to settle. While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer now leaves potential profit on the table. I'm willing to push a bit further in the next round to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair and competitive price."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress, but Holding Firm:** I start by acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate, which helps maintain a positive tone. However, I make it clear that his offer is still too low, emphasizing the product's unique value. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $50,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This concession is significant enough to encourage Bob but small enough to maintain a strong negotiating position.
* **Finality and Urgency:** By framing this offer as a means to ""move things forward,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency without resorting to hardball tactics. This could encourage Bob to make a more serious counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,300,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my minimum selling price and John's offer. Accepting secures a $100,000 profit.
* **Negotiation Momentum Shifting:** Bob's willingness to meet halfway and his statement about closing the deal at this price suggest he might not be willing to go much higher.
* **Time Value and Risk:** Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling. Accepting now guarantees a substantial profit and avoids potential complications."
