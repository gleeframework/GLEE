Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum. How about we meet at $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is clearly holding firm around $120 or higher.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price better than John's $150 offer."
