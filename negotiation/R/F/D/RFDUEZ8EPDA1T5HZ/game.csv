"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 for the product. Let's keep talking.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
