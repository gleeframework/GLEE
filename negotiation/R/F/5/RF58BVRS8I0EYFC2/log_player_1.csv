Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects a fair offer considering its potential worth to you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down in price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential worth,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's benefits without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to discussion, making Bob more likely to engage rather than immediately walk away.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, so there's no pressure to accept anything less. This allows you to confidently aim high with Bob."
