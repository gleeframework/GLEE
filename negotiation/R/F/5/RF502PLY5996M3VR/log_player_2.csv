# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $95, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to you, but Alice is only asking $95. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
