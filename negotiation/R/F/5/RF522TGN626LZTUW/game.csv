"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $999000 for it. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for the product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $925000. I was thinking more along the lines of $875000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider this price?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $875000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer $900000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $885000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to pay more. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",885000.0,Bob,8,
