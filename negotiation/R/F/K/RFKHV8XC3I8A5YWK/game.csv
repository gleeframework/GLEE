"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm making a counteroffer of $1050000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $50000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value you'll be getting.",1050000.0,Alice,5,,
