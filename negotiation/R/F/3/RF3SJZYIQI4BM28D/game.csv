"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $12,000 to make it work.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I believe this price reflects the value this product will bring you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go.",13000.0,Bob,4,
