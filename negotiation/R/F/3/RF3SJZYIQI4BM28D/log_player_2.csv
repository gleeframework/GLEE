"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to establish that you won't accept a price anywhere near her initial ask.  We have plenty of room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $12,000 to make it work."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** We're making a substantial drop from her initial offer to demonstrate that we're serious buyers but also unwilling to accept a price close to her initial offer.
* **Strong but Negotiable:** $12,000 is a strong opening counter, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Sets a Target:** This counteroffer starts to establish a price range closer to our desired outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I believe this price reflects the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $17,000 is still too high. We need to show her we're willing to walk away if the price isn't right, keeping our option to buy from John open.  We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness (Slight):** We're increasing our offer, but only slightly, to demonstrate that we are willing to negotiate but also firm on our budget.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message emphasizes our budget constraints and sets a clear limit, putting the negotiation back in Alice's court.
* **Strategic Position:** This positions us closer to a potential compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation if Alice is willing."
