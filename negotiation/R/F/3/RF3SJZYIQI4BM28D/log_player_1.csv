Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $12,000 to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I believe this price reflects the value this product will bring you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $13,000. Accepting his offer would mean a $7,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's not worth risking further negotiation for a relatively small potential gain.  Selling to John guarantees the best outcome in this scenario."
