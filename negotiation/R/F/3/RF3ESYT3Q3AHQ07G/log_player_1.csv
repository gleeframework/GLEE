Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $850,000, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try and counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $900000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $875000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to budge, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $890000. I'm willing to go up to $880000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $885000. I'm willing to go up to $882500, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, we're running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. $882,500 is still a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000."
