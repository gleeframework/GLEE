,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price for this product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
