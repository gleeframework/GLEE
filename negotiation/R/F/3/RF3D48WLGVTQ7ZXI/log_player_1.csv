Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me a decent profit.
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer creates space for counter-offers and negotiations. 
* **Safety Net:**  My back-up plan is to sell to John for $15,000, so I have a strong bargaining position.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum ($15,000) but I need to be flexible enough to close a deal. 
* **Balance Value and Negotiation:** My offer balances Bob's perceived value with my need to maximize profit. 
* **Stay Agile:**  I'm prepared to accept counter-offers or make new offers depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I have room to negotiate upwards. 
* **John's Offer:** My backup option with John guarantees a higher profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiate Higher:**  I'll counter Bob's offer and try to reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to secure a sale that allows me to earn as much as possible.
* **Don't Settle Too Quickly:** I'm willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer if it means getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This counter-offer demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** By suggesting $11,000, I'm proposing a midpoint between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000).
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce the deal's attractiveness.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Negotiation:** I'm actively engaging in the negotiation process to achieve a mutually agreeable price.
* **Balancing Profit and Agreement:** I'm aiming to secure a profitable sale while also being open to compromise.
* **Staying Firm on Value:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not sacrificing my minimum price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation could result in a stalemate or even a lower price. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price and a higher profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Secure Profit:** I'm prioritizing a guaranteed profit over a potential but uncertain deal with Bob.
* **Minimize Risk:**  This decision minimizes the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower sale price.
* **Time is Money:**  Selling to John allows me to finalize the sale quickly and move on to other opportunities."
