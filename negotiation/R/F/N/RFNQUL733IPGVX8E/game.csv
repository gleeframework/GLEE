"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand you have a budget, but $11000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product offers.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $12500? This is a serious offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $12500 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $12750?  This is a final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",12750.0,Alice,5,
