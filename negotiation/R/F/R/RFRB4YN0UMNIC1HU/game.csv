"I understand that you think the product is worth more to you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not quite there yet.

This is the last offer I can make, and I hope we can finalize the deal here.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're really trying to make this deal work, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering to sell the product for $1175000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this deal and explore other options. I'm going to put the product on the market and see if I can find a better offer from someone else.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
