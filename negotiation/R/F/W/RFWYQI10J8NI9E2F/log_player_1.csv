Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy it for $10,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know *for sure* that Bob values the product at $15,000. If she had perfect information, she'd offer it at $14,999.  This approach balances profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
