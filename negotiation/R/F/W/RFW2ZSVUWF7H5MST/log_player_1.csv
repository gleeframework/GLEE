Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering the product at my minimum acceptable price, hoping Bob will accept it. I'm also leaving room for negotiation if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price range with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $75 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with the deal.  John is offering my minimum, and I'm going to take the safe option and sell to him."
