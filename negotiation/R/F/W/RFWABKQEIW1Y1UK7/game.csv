"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $110? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $130 is still a little more than I can comfortably afford. How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,135.0
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about $135? It's still a good deal for you, and it's the best I can do.",135.0,Alice,5,,
