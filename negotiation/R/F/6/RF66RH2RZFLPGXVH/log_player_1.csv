Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $120, our goal is to get the highest price possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $80.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $110 creates a perceived ""deal"" for Bob. It's significantly lower than what we value it at ($120) and John is willing to pay, but still a profit above Bob's valuation.
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters the offer."
