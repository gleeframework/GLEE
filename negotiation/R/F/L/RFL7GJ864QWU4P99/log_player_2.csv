"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment. I'm starting with an offer of $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's discuss.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the product's value while still allowing for a fair profit for me.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,350,000 is still too low. To reach a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while ensuring I receive a fair price for the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Alice is coming down, she's still above your maximum budget and John's offer. There's no guarantee she'll go below $1,500,000 in future rounds.  It makes more sense to buy from John at this point to guarantee you get the product at the best possible price."
