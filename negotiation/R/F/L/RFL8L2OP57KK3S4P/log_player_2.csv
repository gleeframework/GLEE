Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $7,100, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,300. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,300

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and while we could try to haggle further, it's getting close to John's price.  It's better to secure the deal now at $7,300 than risk Alice increasing the price or the negotiations falling through."
