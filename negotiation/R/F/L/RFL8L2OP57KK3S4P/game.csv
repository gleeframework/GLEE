"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it.",7750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $7,750 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $6,800? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs.",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,100, but that's as high as I can go.  It's important for me to stay within my budget.",7100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $7,100, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,300. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",7300.0,Alice,7,
