Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $120? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go above his stated maximum of $120.  It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than risk Bob walking away in the next few rounds."
