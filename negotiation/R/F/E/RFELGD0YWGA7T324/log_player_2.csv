"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible, and $110 is still above his maximum of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob starts with a reasonable counteroffer, aiming to be close to his desired price while showing a willingness to negotiate.  This also allows him to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which I believe is fair for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $95 is a better offer than $110, it's still above Bob's desired price of $80. Bob can continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, which I think is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is slowly moving towards Alice's price, but still trying to keep it close to his target of $80.  He is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise, while also emphasizing fairness in the counteroffer."
