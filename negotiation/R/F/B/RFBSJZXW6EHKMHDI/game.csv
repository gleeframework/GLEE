"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $900000 is significantly below what I believe this product is worth. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to reduce my price slightly. I'm proposing $1050000. This price still allows me a good return on my investment, while also offering you a substantial value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1050000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $980000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. While I appreciate your counteroffer, $980000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1020000. This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities and provides you with a significant return on your investment. I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our desired outcomes.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1020000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $990000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me and the market price.",990000.0,Bob,6,
