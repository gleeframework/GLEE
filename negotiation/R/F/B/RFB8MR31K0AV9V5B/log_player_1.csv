Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, my budget for this purchase is $12,000.  I'm willing to pay that amount, which is still above your valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
