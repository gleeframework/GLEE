"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still a bit above your budget of $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",825000.0,Alice,5,
