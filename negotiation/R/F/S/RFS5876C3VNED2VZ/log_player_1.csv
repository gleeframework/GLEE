{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking $17,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob ($17,000 vs. $15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down and still potentially make a good profit.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know I'm willing to discuss the price, making the offer less threatening and encouraging him to respond. 
* **Knowing my backup:**  I'm aware I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at any price.

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation where I can explore if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $14,500?  I'm serious about buying this, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,500 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for anything less than what I know the product is worth to me.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price that's closer to my ideal. This will give me a better chance of maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I can do $16,000 for it.  This is close to my minimum, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a price closer to my minimum:** I'm increasing my previous offer from $17,000 to $16,000, moving closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potential to meet in the middle.
* **Reinforce my minimum:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of my bottom line by saying ""close to my minimum,"" so he understands there's limited room for further negotiation. 

This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still advocating for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're still a bit higher than I'm hoping for. I can do $15,500. This is my absolute max, and I'd really like to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $16,000, it's likely that further negotiation won't get me much higher. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a profit above my minimum. There's a risk that I could get a slightly better offer, but the potential reward isn't worth the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. It's also important to consider the time and energy involved in continued negotiation."
