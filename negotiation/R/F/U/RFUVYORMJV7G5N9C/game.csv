"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is closer to your last offer, and represents a fair price considering the value of the product to us both.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this point.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to sell the product to you at $9,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
