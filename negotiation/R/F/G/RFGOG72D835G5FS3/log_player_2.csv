"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While $12,000 is a good deal, he can likely get it for less. There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Clear and Respectful:** The message is polite and explains Bob's reasoning for the counteroffer. 
* **Sets a Strong Baseline:**  By starting low, Bob can establish a favorable starting point for future negotiations. 
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  There's still room for Bob to increase his offer if necessary, but he's setting a clear target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I value your interest, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,000 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate further. There are 7 rounds left, and Bob has a clear goal to save as much money as possible. He can try to get Alice to come down a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This shows my genuine interest in buying your product, and it's a fair price considering the value we both place on it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This suggests he's serious about buying the product but is still looking for a good deal.
* **Appealing to Shared Interest:**  Bob emphasizes the shared interest in reaching a fair agreement, building a collaborative tone.
* **Framing the Offer:** The message highlights the ""fair"" price and Bob's ""genuine interest,"" making the offer more appealing to Alice.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for Bob to increase his offer if necessary, leaving space for a mutually agreeable price."
