"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer but $1,900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but my budget is capped at $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to work with me on that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you sharing your perspective. While I understand your budget constraints, the value this product brings is substantial. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,700,000 is still above my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we've both agreed on. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
