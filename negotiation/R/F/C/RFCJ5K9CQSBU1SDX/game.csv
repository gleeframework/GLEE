"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value it holds. Let's meet in the middle.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $13,500 is still below my minimum value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,250.  This is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's reach a compromise!",14250.0,Alice,5,
