"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a very competitive price of $1,250,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you. I believe this offer is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering it's well below your valuation but still a significant profit for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $950,000. This offer still provides you with a considerable profit, and allows me to achieve a more reasonable price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $1,000,000, but I'm still finding it hard to justify going that high. How about we settle on $875,000? This offer keeps us moving closer to a compromise and represents a substantial profit margin for you.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $925,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This offer still allows you to purchase the product at a price significantly below its value to you. Let's finalize this deal and make this mutually beneficial.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can see you're firm on your price, and I'm willing to increase my offer slightly. How about $900,000? This demonstrates my commitment to closing the deal while still securing a reasonable price.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting very close to a deal. I see your commitment to acquiring this product, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. I'm willing to accept $912,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  This offer still allows you to purchase the product at a price significantly below its value to you while ensuring a favorable outcome for me.  Let's close this deal and make this mutually beneficial.",912500.0,Alice,7,
