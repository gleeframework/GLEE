Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our desired outcome. We have room to negotiate and are confident we can secure a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Could you consider $1,200,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

We're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still below our target. We'll continue negotiating to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,150,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've thought about it and decided to counteroffer at $1,125,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While we could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is a solid deal. It exceeds our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations or Bob walking away."
