"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that you're on a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to counter with $9750. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my maximum budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $8800. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can work with me on this price.",8800.0,Bob,6,
