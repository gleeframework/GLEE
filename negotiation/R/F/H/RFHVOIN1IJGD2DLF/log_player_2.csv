Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000} 
```

Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $6,000. I'm going to meet her halfway and offer $6,000. This is a good compromise and a decent price. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, but if not, I'll have to consider buying from John."

```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and Alice is still refusing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  At this point, it's clear that I won't be able to get a better deal from Alice. Buying from John for $15,000 is the best option to guarantee I get the product."
