"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $100?  It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to go with John's offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
