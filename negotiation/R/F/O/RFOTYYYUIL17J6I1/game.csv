"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $150 to you. I believe it would greatly benefit you and enhance your daily life. Would you like to purchase it at the special introductory price of $140?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $125 for the product? This still offers a good saving compared to its value.",125.0,Alice,3,
