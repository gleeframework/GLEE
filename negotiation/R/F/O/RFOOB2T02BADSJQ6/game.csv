"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $8500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",8800.0,Alice,5,
