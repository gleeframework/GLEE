Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $6800? I think that's a fair compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

At this point, it makes more sense to accept Bob's offer of $6,900. While it's not the ideal price, it's closer to my desired price than John's offer, and it avoids further negotiation."
