"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7250?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $6800? I think that's a fair compromise.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  $6800 is still a bit lower than my bottom line, but I'm willing to come down to $7000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value.  Let's close this deal.",7000.0,Alice,5,
