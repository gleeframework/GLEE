Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200."", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay a price significantly above his perceived value. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you leverage.  If Bob outright rejects this high initial offer, you can quickly move on to John without wasting time on extensive back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $150 matches John's offer, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  Bob's message implies he's quite interested in the product but trying to get a good deal. Rejecting his offer and providing a counter-offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for the possibility of exceeding $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for value. How about we meet in the middle at $175? "", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic aims to create a sense of fairness and compromise. 
* **Above Target, Below Ask:** The $175 price point is still significantly above Bob's perceived value of $100, giving you a strong profit if he accepts. It's also below your initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Pressure Point:**  This counter-offer puts a bit of pressure on Bob. He now knows you have a lower limit and may lose the deal if he doesn't make a move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has now offered $150 twice, signaling that this is likely his upper limit. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $150. There's no risk of further negotiation or Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a time cost. Accepting John's offer provides immediate profit and lets you move on to other potential deals."
