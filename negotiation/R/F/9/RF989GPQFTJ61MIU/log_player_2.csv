"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $10,000 to you and we're looking to sell it for $9,500. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is slightly better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to negotiate further. How about $9,000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room to negotiate. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting this offer allows him to try and get a price closer to his counteroffer of $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  That would be a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested, Bob. Considering your previous offers, how about we agree on $8,900 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is only $400 more than Bob's previous counteroffer of $8,500. This is a good compromise, and accepting the offer would save Bob $1,100 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of reaching a stalemate and having to buy from John increases with each round."
