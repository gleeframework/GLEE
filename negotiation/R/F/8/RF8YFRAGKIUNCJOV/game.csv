"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be workable for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer it to you for $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad to hear that you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit away from my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $765,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm getting close to my target.",765000.0,Alice,7,
