"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial price is way too high for me. This product is good, but not $22,000 good. How about we bring the price down to something more realistic, like $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value than mine, but it's still a significant loss if I accept. I should counter, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $22,000 represents the product's full value, I understand your perspective. Let's find a middle ground - how about $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget, but I need you to meet me closer to my price range.  Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is definitely showing more willingness to negotiate. While his offer is still below my minimum, accepting now would be cutting it close to John's offer and leaving potential profit on the table. I'll counter, but with a smaller concession this time.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. How about $14,500?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this negotiation is taking longer than I expected. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still pushing my limit.  My final offer is $13,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob is clearly signaling this is his last offer, and while it's not ideal, it's better than John's offer. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away.
