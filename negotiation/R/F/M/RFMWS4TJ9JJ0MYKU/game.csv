"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that initial price is way too high for me. This product is good, but not $22,000 good. How about we bring the price down to something more realistic, like $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $22,000 represents the product's full value, I understand your perspective. Let's find a middle ground - how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget, but I need you to meet me closer to my price range.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. How about $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this negotiation is taking longer than I expected. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still pushing my limit.  My final offer is $13,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
