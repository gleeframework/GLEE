"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  He can potentially get the product for a lower price than Alice's initial offer.  There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, and there's no guarantee that John's offer will remain available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so he can offer a significantly lower price and still have room for negotiation. By offering $1,000,000, Bob is testing the waters and seeing how much Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above the $1,200,000 value Alice places on the product. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. He still has several rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might come down further to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's perceived value of the product. He's increasing his offer, but not by much, to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  He's trying to find the sweet spot where he can secure a deal without exceeding his maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is increasing her offer, but it's still above Bob's desired price.  Bob should continue to reject her offers and counter with lower prices.  He has time on his side, and there's a chance Alice will lower her price to close the deal. Buying from John at this point would be a loss for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's perceived value, but still within his budget. He is pushing for a price that is fair to both parties, hoping to reach a compromise.  He is leaving room for negotiation, knowing that Alice might be willing to close the deal at this price to avoid further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  Although they are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, Bob should continue to hold out for a lower price. He's closer to his goal than before, and it's worth pushing for a better deal. There's still a chance that Alice will come down to meet him in the remaining rounds. Buying from John at this point would be a worse outcome for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's perceived value. He's increasing his offer slightly, but still within his budget.  This counteroffer demonstrates his seriousness about closing the deal while trying to find a price that's mutually acceptable.  With only two rounds left, Bob is trying to get the best possible price before having to resort to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer in Round 9 is equal to John's price, meaning Bob is no longer getting a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  At this point, it's better for Bob to accept John's offer and avoid the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice in the final round."
