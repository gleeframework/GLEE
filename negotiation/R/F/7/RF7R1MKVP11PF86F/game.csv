"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $725,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is still a good deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  To be honest, I'm getting close to my limit. I could go up to $750,000, but that's the best I can do.  It's a fair offer considering we both benefit.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a good deal considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,7,
