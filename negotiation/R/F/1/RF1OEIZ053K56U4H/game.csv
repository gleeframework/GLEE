"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still a fair price for you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
