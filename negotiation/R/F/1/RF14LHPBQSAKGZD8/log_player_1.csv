Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 incentive to buy from you instead of exploring alternatives. It also allows you to earn a $2,000 profit, which is a significant portion of the potential profit margin. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't have a more profitable offer lined up. 
* It also assumes you're confident in your understanding of Bob's valuation. If you're unsure, you might offer a slightly lower price to increase the chances of a sale."
