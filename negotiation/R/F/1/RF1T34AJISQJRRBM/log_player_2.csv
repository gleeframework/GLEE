"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her own valuation, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. Rejecting her offer opens the door for negotiation. Alice might be willing to lower the price closer to your $1,000,000 limit. If her price doesn't come down enough, you can always go with John's offer."
