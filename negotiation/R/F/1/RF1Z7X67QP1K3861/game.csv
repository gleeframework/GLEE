"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
