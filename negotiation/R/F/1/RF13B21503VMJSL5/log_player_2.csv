# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I can still make a reasonable profit. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $800,000."
