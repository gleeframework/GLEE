Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $400,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $800,000 (your minimum) and $1,200,000 (Bob's maximum). Any price within this range could lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that $400,000 potential profit as possible. Aiming too high risks Bob rejecting the offer and you settling for $800,000.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Considering its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,050,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. This offer stands for the next 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your hand, you imply that the price is based on the product's inherent value and potential ROI, not just your minimum.
* **Time Constraint:**  Creating a sense of urgency can nudge Bob toward a decision.
* **Price Negotiation Room:** Offering at $1,050,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little while still keeping you significantly above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob tends to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,000,000) to give more negotiation space.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** How comfortable are you with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer? A lower price reduces this risk.
