"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $14,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $14,500. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",13750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,750 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Alice,5,
