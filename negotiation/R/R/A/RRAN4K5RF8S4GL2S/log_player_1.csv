Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Value:** This is the minimum you're willing to accept â€“ $1,500,000 (because John will buy it at that price).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:**  He values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** This is the range where a deal can happen, between $1,200,000 (Bob's value) and $1,500,000 (your value).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price as close to $1,500,000 as possible without alienating Bob. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position.

**Offer to Bob:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm offering it to you at a premium price of $1,450,000.  Given its unique potential and limited availability, I believe this is a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high anchors the negotiation in your favor. 
* **Justification:**  You're not just throwing out a number; you're framing it as a ""premium price"" due to the product's value and scarcity.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you start high, there's some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. However, don't go below your reservation value.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your relationship with Bob and your appetite for risk, you could adjust your approach."
