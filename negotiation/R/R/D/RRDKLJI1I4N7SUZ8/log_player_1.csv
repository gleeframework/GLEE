Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Offering $130 is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price of $150, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still above Bob's perceived value.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value if he sees the product as valuable.
* **Flexibility:** This price gives me the option to either accept a counteroffer closer to $150 or move on to John if Bob doesn't come close enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I could accept his offer, there's a good chance I can get a higher price by counteroffering.
* **John as a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing him I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** $110 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining Value:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving me with a decent profit margin.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes flexibility and encourages Bob to counter if he's still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, which ensures I'll make a profit.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take time and potentially lead to further low offers. 

Selling to John is the best option to maximize my profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
