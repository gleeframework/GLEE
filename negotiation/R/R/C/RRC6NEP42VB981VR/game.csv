"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's value to you, I believe $1,350,000 would be a fair compromise.  It leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
