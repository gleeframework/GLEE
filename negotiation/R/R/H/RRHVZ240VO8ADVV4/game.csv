"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I am still unable to pay $17500 for the product. My maximum offer remains at $16000.",16000.0,Bob,4,
