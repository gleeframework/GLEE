"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering our mutual interests.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $950,000 and my initial ask reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
