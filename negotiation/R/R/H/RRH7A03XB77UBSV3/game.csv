"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've done my research and I know the product's value is higher than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
