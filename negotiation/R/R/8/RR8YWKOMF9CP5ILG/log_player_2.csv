Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $125. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $125.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $120, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings rather than risk Alice sticking to her ""final offer"" and potentially missing out on the product entirely."
