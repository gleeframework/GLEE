Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering the return you'll gain. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aim high, but within reason. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leaving Negotiation Space:**  Starting at $925,000 allows for some back and forth if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" to justify the high price.
* **Strong Call to Action:** A direct question encourages Bob to respond.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving you with a comfortable profit margin above your guaranteed sale to John."
