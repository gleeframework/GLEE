"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a decent price for me, considering my minimum is $15,000.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the value proposition for Bob - he gets a deal on a product worth more to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm trying to be a smart buyer, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is too low:** While Bob is trying to be ""smart"",  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there is still room for negotiation.  I can counteroffer and try to get a better price without risking a complete deal break.
* **John is the safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if things don't work out, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,500?  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still being firm on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the deal for Bob, reminding him of the value he gets from the product, which reinforces the potential value of the offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob and keep the negotiations moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to pay $9,800, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, indicating that further negotiation is possible. I believe there's a chance to get a higher price.
* **John remains a safety net:** Selling to John for $15,000 is still a viable option, allowing me to take a calculated risk by continuing to negotiate. 

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,150. This is a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's offer ($9,800).  This shows a willingness to compromise and find a meeting point.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect, which can appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him more receptive to the offer.
* **Closeness to a Deal:** I reiterate the goal of reaching a deal, reminding Bob that this is a good opportunity for both of us. 

This approach aims to maintain a positive and collaborative tone while still pushing for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer. How about $10,075? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,075. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,075
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $10,075 is getting closer to my desired price point of $15,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but continuing to reject his offers might risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob increases.

While $10,075 is still below my initial goal, it's a good deal considering the remaining rounds. Accepting allows me to secure a sale without risking a complete breakdown in negotiations."
