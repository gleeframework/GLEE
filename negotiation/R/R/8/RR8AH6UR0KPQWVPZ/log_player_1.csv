Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While selling to John guarantees $12,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($11,000) makes it tempting while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. Alice can then decide whether to lower the price slightly or stick with selling to John."
