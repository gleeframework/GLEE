Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm, emphasizing the value proposition and the potential for a win-win scenario.

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** $1,200,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value, offering a good profit.
* **Start negotiation:** It leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation process to begin.
* **Maintain leverage:** The offer highlights the product's value and your willingness to sell to another buyer (John) if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to me ($1,500,000). By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Continue negotiations:** I can potentially secure a higher price by counteroffering. 
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away.
* **Explore alternatives:**  I can continue negotiations with Bob while simultaneously evaluating whether selling to John is a better option.

My goal is to get as close to my desired price of $1,500,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,100,000 is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Message:** The message is polite and focused on finding a mutually beneficial solution. It reiterates the product's value while showing flexibility.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Keep negotiations moving:**  It demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The offer is still relatively high, giving Bob an incentive to accept.
* **Signal a willingness to meet halfway:**  The compromise shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is tempting, it's still too far below my desired price of $1,500,000.  Given that Bob claims this is his final offer, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price. 

Selling to John is the best option:

* **Maximizes profit:** I get my desired price and avoid further negotiation with Bob.
* **Eliminates risk:**  There's no guarantee Bob would accept any further counteroffers, and I risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price.
* **Offers certainty:**  Selling to John provides a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements. 

By selling to John, I ensure the best possible outcome for myself."
