"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's room for negotiation.  You can likely get a lower price. It's worth trying to counteroffer to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000 for this product.  Given my value for it, I believe this price is still fair.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise, saving you $3,500 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice walking away, leaving you to pay John's higher price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
