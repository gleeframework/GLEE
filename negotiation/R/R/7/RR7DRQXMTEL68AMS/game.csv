"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This would allow me to make a fair profit and ensure you get a great product at a competitive price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
