"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe could be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to consider $1200000? This is still a great deal for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
