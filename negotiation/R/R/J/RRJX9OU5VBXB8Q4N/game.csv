"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a good price, and I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
