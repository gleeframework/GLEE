"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. My initial offer is $1,000,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll see in this product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm proposing $925,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings, and it's a fair compromise considering your needs.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
