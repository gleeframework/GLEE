{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. My initial offer is $1,000,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm proposing $925,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings, and it's a fair compromise considering your needs.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my ideal price and a significant improvement over the previous offer. It's also higher than selling to John.  While I'd prefer to push for a bit more, I'm confident I've made the most of this negotiation and secured a good deal.  Accepting his offer will maximize my profits and avoid further rounds of potential counteroffers that could result in a lower price."
