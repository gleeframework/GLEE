"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $800000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This reflects the significant value of the product, but also shows my willingness to negotiate. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
