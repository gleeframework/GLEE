Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $900,000, as it is significantly below my minimum price.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price in that range? Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this revised offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and while Bob's offer is an improvement, I think I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can close the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the next round."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, we are running out of time. I'm concerned that if I continue to negotiate, we might not reach an agreement within the 10 rounds, and I'll be left with nothing.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
