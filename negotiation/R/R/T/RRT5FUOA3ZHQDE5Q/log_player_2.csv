"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $160. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $160 is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($120) and what John offers ($120). It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but could you do it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes your interest in getting a price well below her initial offer.
* **Polite but Direct:** The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship but also directly states your price limit. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will help you gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $160 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $140? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is better than her initial offer, it's still above both your maximum price and what John offers. You have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $120 is the highest I can go. If you're able to do that, I'm ready to buy right now."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer presents your maximum budget as a firm offer while still acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating you're ""ready to buy right now,"" you add a bit of incentive for Alice to accept, suggesting you might walk away otherwise.
* **Matching John's Offer:** This price matches your alternative option, putting the decision in Alice's hands. It forces her to decide if selling to you is worth it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. Unfortunately, $120 is a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we do $130? It's still a good compromise, and I think we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go down to $120. She's signaled this twice now, and her counter-offer of $130 reinforces that. 
* **John's Offer is Better:**  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a low chance of success and might mean missing out on John's offer.
* **Time Value:** Further negotiation takes time. Accepting John's offer provides a certain outcome and avoids potential frustration."
