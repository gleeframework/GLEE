"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $11,500? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
