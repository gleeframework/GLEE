Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
