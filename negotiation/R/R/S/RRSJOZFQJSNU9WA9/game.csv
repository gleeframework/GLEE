"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to that amount?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. It's a significant undervaluation of the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? It's a compromise that gets us closer to the middle, but still within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
