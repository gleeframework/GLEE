"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about $700,000? I think that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very good price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
