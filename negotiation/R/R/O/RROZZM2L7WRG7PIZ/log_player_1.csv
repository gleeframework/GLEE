**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested but trying to lowball us. We're still significantly above John's offer, so we have room to negotiate.  We need to signal we're getting close to our limit though."

Round 8

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and while it's not ideal, it's still $50,000 more than John's guaranteed offer. It's better to accept a slightly lower price now than risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer."
