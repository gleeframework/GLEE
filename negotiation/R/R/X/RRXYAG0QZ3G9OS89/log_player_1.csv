Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:**  By starting with a price close to your minimum ($1,500,000), you anchor the negotiation high. Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it sets a strong starting point.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer allows for some negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Highlighting value, not just price:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential"" and ""significant return on investment,"" subtly reminding Bob of the benefits beyond the initial cost.

**Backup Plan (John):**

You have a strong backup plan with John, ensuring you'll get your minimum price if Bob rejects the offer. This allows you to negotiate confidently with Bob."
