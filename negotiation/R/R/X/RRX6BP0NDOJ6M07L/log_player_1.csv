"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly more than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By not starting at my absolute minimum, I give Bob room to counteroffer and I maintain the opportunity to negotiate. 
* **Setting a deadline:**  The 10 rounds gives me a framework to manage the negotiation and avoids dragging it out indefinitely. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 allows me to be more confident in walking away from a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I am willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is a significant improvement over Bob's initial perceived value of $8,000, it's still far below my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a low price.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate.  I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation process and using John's offer as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm making a slight concession by coming down to $11,000, but I'm still well above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm expressing a willingness to finalize the deal, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm using a combination of firmness and flexibility to push Bob towards a price closer to my minimum.  My goal is to get closer to $15,000 while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm not willing to settle for that amount, especially considering I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay $15,000. 

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum. I will use the threat of selling to John as leverage to push Bob towards a more favorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm making a significant concession by coming down to $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing to Bob and make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Focusing on a positive outcome:**  I'm emphasizing the potential for both of us to be ""happy"" with the outcome, which encourages a positive and collaborative negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This is a strategic move to gauge Bob's willingness to come up in price. If he accepts, I've secured a decent price closer to my desired range. If he rejects, I still have room to make a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I am willing to pay $10,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,200 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable range. I am not willing to sell the product for less than $15,000, especially with John as a guaranteed buyer at that price.  

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob. Even though we are getting closer, I believe I can push for a higher price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make another counteroffer and see if I can secure a deal closer to my minimum before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $10,200 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go one step further to make this deal work. Let's try $10,350.  This is a final offer from my side. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to move on to other opportunities. "", ""product_price"": 10350}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:**  I'm framing this as a ""final offer"" to put pressure on Bob and make him realize that this is the last opportunity to strike a deal.
* **Small concession:** I'm only increasing my offer slightly to $10,350, showcasing that I'm still firm on my minimum price.
* **Alternative options:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options (John) if we can't agree, raising the stakes for him.

**Strategy:**

This round is about pushing Bob to the limit.  My hope is that he will realize that he's close to the best deal he'll get, and he'll accept. However, if he rejects, I'm ready to move on to John and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I am willing to pay $10,250 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation process, and Bob's offer of $10,250 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. With only two rounds left, it's highly unlikely that we will be able to reach an agreement that meets my requirements.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John. While I would have preferred to sell the product to Bob at a higher price, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all is too high.  I'm confident that John's offer is the best possible outcome at this point."
