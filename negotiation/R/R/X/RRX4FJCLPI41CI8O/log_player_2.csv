"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a better price than John's $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's a potential for a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
