Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Openness:** I'm emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to counteroffer and hopefully find a price that works for both of us.
* **John as Backup:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $80, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't yield a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Bob's offer of $90 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, so it's a good deal for me.
* **Risk of Counteroffers:**  If I reject his offer, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price in subsequent rounds.  Bob might get frustrated and walk away, or I might end up accepting his offer later anyway.
* **John's Offer:**  While I could sell to John for $80, the $90 offer from Bob is better."
