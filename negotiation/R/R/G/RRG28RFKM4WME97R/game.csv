"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this work. This is a significant investment for you, and I'm sure you'll find this product to be extremely valuable. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. Let's compromise at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
