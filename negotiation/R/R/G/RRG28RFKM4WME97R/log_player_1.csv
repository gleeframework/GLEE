Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this work.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. Let's compromise at $1,000,000.
