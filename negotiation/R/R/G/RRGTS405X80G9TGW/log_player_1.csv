Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the benefits to Bob, highlighting the ""great deal"" he's getting. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a potential compromise.
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware of my backup option (selling to John for $1,200,000), so I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately.

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit while leaving open the possibility of a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for your product. This price aligns better with my budget while still allowing me to acquire the item I need. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I can get from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept his current offer.
* **Strategic Bargaining:** Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and that I'm not desperate to sell. This will hopefully encourage him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives you a good price and allows me to reach a fair deal. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm responding to Bob's offer with a counter-offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate but also setting a clear lower limit.
* **Moderate Adjustment:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's price but not by too much. This shows flexibility while still leaving room for potential further negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message suggests a desire to close the deal, hinting at a possibility of losing out on the sale if he doesn't accept.
* **Strong Justification:**  I emphasize the fairness of the price and reiterate that it provides a good value for him.

This approach aims to push Bob closer to my desired price while maintaining a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $925,000 for your product. This price is closer to what I am comfortable with, while still being a fair offer for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $950,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  While I'd prefer to sell for $950,000, accepting Bob's offer now opens the door for future potential business with him.
* **Risk of Losing John:**  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk John withdrawing his offer. 
* **Time Factor:**  Continued negotiation could prolong the process and potentially impact my overall earnings.

This decision balances the immediate financial gain with the potential for future collaboration and minimizes the risk of losing out on a guaranteed sale."
