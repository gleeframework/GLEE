"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value of the product to you and the original price I'm willing to sell it for, I think we can reach a mutual agreement.

"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground here. Given the product's value to you and my initial asking price, I'd like to suggest an offer of $10375.

I hope this helps us move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10375.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with. I'll meet you at $10250 was too high, but I'll go to $10200. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10200.0,Bob,6,

I'm willing to meet you at $10150, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John for $10000. I'm willing to make one last concession, so I'll meet you at $10150. If I don't get a yes, I'll be buying from John.",10150.0,Bob,10,
