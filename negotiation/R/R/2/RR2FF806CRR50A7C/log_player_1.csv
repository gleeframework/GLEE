Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because:

* It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* It leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $12,000.

By starting high, I can potentially maximize my profit. However, I'm also willing to negotiate and potentially accept a lower price if necessary.  I'm prepared to keep negotiating with Bob until we reach a mutually agreeable price, or I can sell the product to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering his initial offer of $10,500 and the fact that he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,800 is only $300 less than my last offer, and it's getting closer to a point where I might as well sell to John for $10,000.  It's a good deal for me, considering my minimum acceptable price is $10,000. I'll accept his offer and finalize the deal."
