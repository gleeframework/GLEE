Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go down a bit more to $11,750.  This is a fair price that's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a reasonable return.  Let's close this deal!

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly further.  At this point, John's offer of $12,000 is more appealing than continuing to negotiate with a slim chance of saving a small amount."
