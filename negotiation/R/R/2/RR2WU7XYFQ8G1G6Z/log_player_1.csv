"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be of great value to you. My initial offer is $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer while highlighting the potential value. 

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:**  By starting high, you leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Focus on value:** Emphasize the product's potential value to Bob to make the price more acceptable.
* **Be prepared to walk away:**  Remember that you have a backup buyer in John, which gives you leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $6,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* It's too early to sell to John, as I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will keep the negotiation moving and demonstrate my willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.  I'll need to find a price that is attractive to Bob but still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:**  This price is still above Bob's initial offer but shows a significant willingness to compromise. It's also well above my minimum price, allowing me to make a profit.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's perspective while emphasizing my own value proposition and the compromise I'm offering.

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  By offering a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, I am demonstrating a commitment to finding a deal.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the value proposition of the product to remind Bob of the potential benefits of owning it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $8,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* I have already made two counteroffers, and accepting this offer will secure a profit, albeit a small one.
*  It's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers as we get closer to the end of the negotiation rounds.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:**  While I would prefer a higher price,  accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether.  
* **Time is of the essence:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be realistic about the potential for getting a significantly higher price."
