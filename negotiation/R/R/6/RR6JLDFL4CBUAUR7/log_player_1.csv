I'm going to reject this offer and try to squeeze out a bit more in the next round. While $912,500 is tempting, I still have some negotiating room and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept this offer. While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price of $1,200,000, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. $915,625 is a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $1,200,000 and having to deal with the potential hassle of another negotiation."
