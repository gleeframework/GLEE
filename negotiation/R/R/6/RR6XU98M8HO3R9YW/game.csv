"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  $9,000 is just below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great price for a product you value at $10,000, and it gives me a little room to make this worthwhile.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9,800 just isn't going to work for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,150?  It's only $350 more than your last offer and still less than what I initially proposed.  Let's make this happen.",10150.0,Alice,5,
