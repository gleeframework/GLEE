Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and exclusivity to justify the high price, potentially persuading Bob. 
* **Limited-Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:** While this offer aims high, be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust the price downwards, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $15,000."
