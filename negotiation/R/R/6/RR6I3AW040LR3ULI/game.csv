"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  While I understand your perspective on the value,  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  I'm prepared to sell for $1,600,000.  This gives us both a fair profit, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for being willing to come down from your initial price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,520,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value I see in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1520000.0,Bob,4,
