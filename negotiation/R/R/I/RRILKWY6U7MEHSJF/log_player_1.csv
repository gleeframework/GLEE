{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a slightly higher price than my minimum, but still leaves room for bargaining. It also sets the tone for a positive and open negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum value and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to my minimum value of $10,000.  Accepting his offer ensures I secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
