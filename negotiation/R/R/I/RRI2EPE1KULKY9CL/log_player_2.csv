Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business.

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to spend $8000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10000, which is still a good deal considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I'm still interested, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. Could we agree on $9,000?  This would give me a good deal while still allowing you to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $10500, which is still a good compromise considering the value the product brings to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  I've already made it clear that my maximum is $8,000.  There's no sense in continuing to negotiate with Alice, I'm going to buy from John instead."
