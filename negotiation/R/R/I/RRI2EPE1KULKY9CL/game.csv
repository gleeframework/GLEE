"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $8000 on this product.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to spend $8000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10000, which is still a good deal considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I'm still interested, $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Could we agree on $9000?  This would give me a good deal while still allowing you to make a profit.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $10500, which is still a good compromise considering the value the product brings to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
