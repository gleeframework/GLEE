"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While the product is worth $800,000 to me, I want to save as much money as possible. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always walk away and buy from John for $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives you a good profit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer and is closer to my ideal price point.  It's still a good deal for Alice, as it's higher than the value she places on the product. This approach is a good starting point for negotiation and allows for some room for compromise in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $900,000 is still higher than my ideal price. I am aiming for a price closer to $800,000, which would allow me to maximize my savings. Since I have remaining rounds, rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair compromise and reflects the value we both place on this product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a significant compromise, moving closer to Alice's last offer and closer to my ideal price of $800,000.  It shows Alice that I am serious about negotiating, while also giving her a good return on the product.  This should encourage her to consider my offer and potentially move closer to my price point in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. Let's go with $875,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is closer to my target price, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I have several rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to my ideal $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates my commitment to my previous offer. By reiterating my offer, I show Alice that I am serious about achieving a price point that is mutually beneficial. This tactic can sometimes lead to a quick resolution, especially if Alice is eager to finalize the deal.  Additionally, since this is Round 6, there is a sense of urgency that could influence Alice's decision."
