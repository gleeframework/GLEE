Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for what this product offers. Would you consider $1,050,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, suggesting he's willing to pay more. Let's keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium over John's offer. Accepting $975,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
