"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm starting with an offer of $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Setting a positive tone:** I'm friendly and highlight the potential value to Bob. 
* **Open to discussion:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, indicating I'm open to negotiation. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially set the stage for a successful deal, while still being prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** $12,000 is still below my floor of $10,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than my minimum value at this point.
* **Potential for higher counteroffers:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially increase the price closer to my desired range. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and keep the negotiation process moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $13,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to fairly compensate for the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** I'm not going back to my initial asking price, but I'm also not completely rejecting Bob's offer.  $13,500 is a middle ground that shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product, reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him.
* **Staying within my limits:** $13,500 is still higher than my minimum value of $10,000,  giving me some leeway for further negotiation. 

This counteroffer allows me to stay in control while showing flexibility and increasing the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm not comfortable going above $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $12750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum value:** Bob's offer of $12,750 is finally above my minimum value of $10,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:** With only 6 rounds left, it's getting more risky to keep rejecting offers.
* **Potential for better offers:**  While I'd ideally get closer to my initial asking price, there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and I risk losing the deal altogether.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and guarantees a profit. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's a practical decision given the limited time and the risk of getting a lower price in subsequent rounds."
