Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a fair price that leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I make a profit above my minimum of $80.  I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80, and it's closer to my initial offer of $100.  It's likely that we'll be going back and forth for a while, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn.  I'll accept his offer and make a profit."
