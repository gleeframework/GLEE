{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts in the middle of the potential price range.  It's a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation without immediately making Bob feel like he's being taken advantage of.  It also allows me to see how interested Bob really is in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm not going to accept it just yet. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can come to a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's still a good deal for you, as you mentioned the product is worth $15,000 to you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $9,750 is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  It seems like Bob is serious about buying the product and we're close to an agreement. I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate."
