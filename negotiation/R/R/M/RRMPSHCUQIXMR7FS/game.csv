"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to give you a good discount. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. This product is only worth $10,000 to me, so I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling the product for $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I could potentially go up to $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $12,000, but I'm willing to make a small concession. I can sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
