Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. $9,000 is too low for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a great deal, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $9,750 is still a bit low for me, and I have a few more rounds to try and negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $10,250?  That would be a fair compromise, and we could close this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  That's a significant increase from my initial offer and a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,000 is a good deal.  It's only $250 away from my last counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
