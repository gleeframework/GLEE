"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a great deal, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's try to meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $9,750? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $10,250?  That would be a fair compromise, and we could close this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  That's a significant increase from my initial offer and a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
