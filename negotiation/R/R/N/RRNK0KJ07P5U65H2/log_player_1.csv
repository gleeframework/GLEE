Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming high initially allows you to potentially secure the maximum profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $11,500 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate if he wishes, potentially still landing you a deal above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have the safety net of selling to John for $8,000, ensuring you don't lose out completely."
