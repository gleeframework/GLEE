Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a great opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's positive, emphasizes value, and positions the price as an opportunity.
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down slightly if needed while still exceeding your minimum. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before walking away and selling to John.
* **Negotiation:** This is a simplified example.  Real-world negotiations often involve more factors, communication, and potentially building rapport."
