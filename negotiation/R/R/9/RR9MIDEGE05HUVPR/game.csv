,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $85? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to go up a little, but $105 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $95.  I really think this is a fair price and we can finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet at $110? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.",110.0,Alice,5,
