{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know this product is worth significantly more to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This gives you a good profit margin.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob incentive to negotiate, but he still sees a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This keeps the negotiation dynamic.

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point. Your actual offer should be tailored to the specifics of the product and the negotiation dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $900000. This would still be a good profit for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer.  You're in a good position to counteroffer.  

**Here's why rejecting and counteroffering is a good strategy:**

* **You have leverage:** You know the product is worth more to Bob.
* **You can potentially get a higher price:** You can try to bridge the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer. 
* **You haven't lost much:** You're not losing out on your minimum value by rejecting Bob's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to formulate a counteroffer that is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** Aim for a price closer to your initial offer of $1,200,000.
* **But still attractive to Bob:** He's still willing to pay more than $800,000, so you need to find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000.  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep talking!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer brings you closer to Bob's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  It's still significantly higher than your minimum, ensuring you gain a good profit.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:**  This offer leaves space for Bob to make another counteroffer, allowing for a continued back-and-forth. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Bob's Interest:** Observe Bob's reactions to gauge his willingness to pay more. 
* **Your Time:**  If the negotiation drags on, you might want to consider selling to John. 
* **Potential for Compromise:** Be open to finding a compromise that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $950000 seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is very close to your target price of $1,000,000. This is a good outcome for you, as it provides a significant profit.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a deadlock. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more time and energy you invest.  There's always the chance of a deal falling through with Bob, leaving you with the lower offer from John.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures you secure a profitable deal without the risk of further negotiation."
