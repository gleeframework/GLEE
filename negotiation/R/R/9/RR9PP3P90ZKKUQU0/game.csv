"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. Considering my maximum is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000.  This price is still above my perceived value of the product but allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering your offer of $1,050,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit.
