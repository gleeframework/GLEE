"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll find it extremely valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for a better price from John ($8,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for negotiation or can simply proceed to purchase from John and maximize your savings."
