Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Bob still has room to negotiate a lower price, but it's above your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Is competitive:** $1,400,000 is still a good deal for Bob as it's less than the product's value to him.
* **Shows confidence:** Offering a price close to your desired amount indicates you believe in the product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my desired price and only slightly above John's offer. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still leaves you with a substantial profit margin, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $1,150,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

While $1,150,000 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum desired price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try one more time to negotiate with Bob."
