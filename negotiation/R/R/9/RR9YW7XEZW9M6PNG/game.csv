"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still leaves you with a substantial profit margin, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $1,150,000. Would that work for you?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $1,150,000, but I'm struggling to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  It's also a good deal for me, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
