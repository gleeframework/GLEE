"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, while still leaving room to lower the price if needed.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for $1,000,000, especially as I have the option to sell to John for a higher price. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay the same amount. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially losing time, especially since I have a limited number of rounds.  Selling to John is the most sensible decision in this scenario."
