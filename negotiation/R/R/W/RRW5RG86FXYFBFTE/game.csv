"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I believe that's a fair price considering the features and quality you've described. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your perspective, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $7000. Our product is highly valued due to its unique features and quality craftsmanship. To better align with our valuation, how about we consider a price of $7500? This still allows for a reasonable profit while offering a competitive price to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $7000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7250? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers and still think this is a fair price for the product.",7250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and have carefully considered your latest offer. While I would like to accommodate you as much as possible, I am unable to accept $7250 for our product. I propose a price of $7400. This still represents a reasonable profit for us while remaining competitive in the market. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.",7400.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $7300. I hope this is a price that we can agree on.",7300.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your thoughtful consideration, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. After careful reflection, I am proposing a price of $7200 for our product.
