"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  He's willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's a range where both parties can benefit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intention to purchase but also his desire to save money.  It leaves a comfortable margin for negotiation, allowing both parties to potentially reach an agreement.  If Alice rejects, Bob can then make a new counteroffer closer to her desired price if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for Bob compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  This offer is within Bob's acceptable price range, and it's likely that further negotiation might not yield a much lower price.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the most strategic decision at this point."
