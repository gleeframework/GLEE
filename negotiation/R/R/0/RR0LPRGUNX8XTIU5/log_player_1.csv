"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your operations.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for potential negotiation without risking losing the deal completely.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the benefits of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price and even below his own initial assessment. 
* **I need to hold firm.** Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a more reasonable price, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable outcome.  
* **Selling to John is a strong backup option.** If negotiations with Bob ultimately fail, I have a guaranteed sale with John at my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the unique value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm but Reasonable Offer:** I'm significantly increasing the price from Bob's last offer, but still offering a discount from my initial price. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to emphasize why a lower price isn't acceptable.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message is open-ended, encouraging Bob to engage in further negotiation. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** I'm aiming for a price that's close to my minimum acceptable value while still leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects again, I can consider selling to John, but this counteroffer gives me a better chance of a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **I'm confident in my position.** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, and I've already shown a willingness to negotiate.
* **More room for compromise.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my ideal price.
* **Minimizing Loss.** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant financial loss compared to selling to John. 

I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can potentially secure a more advantageous price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $975,000 still falls short of what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects a compromise on both sides, and it's the best I can do at this point. I'm confident you'll see the value this product brings to your business."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** This offer is a slight compromise from my previous offer, showing continued willingness to negotiate while staying close to my minimum price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's unique value to justify the price. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is short and to the point, avoiding unnecessary fluff.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not going lower than $1,025,000 because I'm confident in the product's worth and my guaranteed sale with John. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to avoid further time-wasting and potential loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $987,500. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** It's only a small increase from his previous offer, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a significant loss for me. 
* **Negotiation is getting tedious.**  We're going back and forth with small changes, and it's not clear if we'll ever reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is a strong backup.** I'm hesitant to continue this back-and-forth with Bob. Selling to John guarantees my desired profit and avoids further negotiation fatigue.
* **I'm confident in my position.**  I've shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm not under pressure to sell to Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can move towards a more decisive action, either making a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum or simply selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I've been very patient and willing to negotiate, but $987,500 is still a substantial amount below my minimum.  To be frank, at this point, I'm seriously considering selling to John, who's offering me $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go. If you're serious about acquiring this product, please let me know if you accept."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Confidence, Not Desperation:**  This message is direct and firm, showing that I'm not desperate to sell to Bob and that I have a strong backup option.
* **Highlight John's Offer:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the higher price I could get elsewhere, increasing the pressure for him to accept. 
* **Final Compromise:** This offer is at my absolute minimum, and I'm making it clear that there's no room for further negotiation.
* **Decision Time:** The message directly asks Bob to make a decision, pushing for a resolution. 

This counteroffer is my last attempt to close a deal with Bob. If he rejects, I will immediately sell to John."
