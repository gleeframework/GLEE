Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still potentially securing a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $150 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than John's $100 offer.
* **Confident Demeanor:**  The message aims to project confidence in the product's value, which might make Bob more amenable to a higher price. 

It's important to remember that this is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice (you) will need to adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only able to pay $120 for it. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to your minimum, it's still worthwhile to negotiate further. You have some leverage because you know John will buy the product for $100.  There's a chance to meet in the middle and secure a better deal than both your current offer and John's guaranteed price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting a price of $135, Alice shows she's willing to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Maintaining a Higher Ground:** While moving closer to Bob's offer, Alice still keeps her counteroffer above the guaranteed $100 from John. This keeps the door open for a more profitable outcome.
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is simple and directly addresses Bob's counteroffer, making the negotiation process smoother."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with $130 for the product. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $130 is a reasonable compromise.  

* **Profitable:** It's significantly higher than your guaranteed $100 from John.
* **Minimizes Risk:**  Further negotiation could lead Bob to walk away or offer a lower price, bringing you closer to John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forth negotiations."
