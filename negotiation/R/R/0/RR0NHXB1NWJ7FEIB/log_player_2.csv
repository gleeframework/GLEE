"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better deal than John's offer of $15,000, Bob can likely do better by counter-offering. 

Alice values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $13000, but I'm still looking to get a bit more value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is a good deal:** $13,500 is significantly cheaper than John's offer of $15,000 and is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $13,000. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might not be worth it:**  There's a chance Bob could get a slightly better price, but it's risky to keep negotiating. Alice might be unwilling to go lower, and Bob could end up paying more or losing the deal entirely.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures a good price and avoids the risk of a more costly outcome."
