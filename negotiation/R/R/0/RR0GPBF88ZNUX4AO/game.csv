"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,300,000 is tempting,  I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the product's full potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that would be mutually beneficial.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'd be willing to go up to $1,320,000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
