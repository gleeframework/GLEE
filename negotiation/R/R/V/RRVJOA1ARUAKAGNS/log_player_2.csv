"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a special price as I value your potential partnership. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I truly believe this product could be a game-changer for your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You know you can get the product from John for $15,000. Alice's offer is also $15,000. There's no benefit to accepting her offer, so it's better to keep the option open to potentially negotiate with her or find another seller later."
