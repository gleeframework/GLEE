Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm asking for $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for a price between what it's worth to you ($1,200,000) and what it's worth to Bob ($800,000) creates a potential win-win situation.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale without having to resort to your backup option (John)."
