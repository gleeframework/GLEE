Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like I'm willing to work with him. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I mention the product's value to emphasize the potential benefit for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price of $150 as possible. 
* I'm aware of John's offer as a fallback option, so I don't feel pressured to make a big concession in the first round. 
* I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer.  His response will inform my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I appreciate Bob's interest, $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better price. This will likely encourage Bob to increase his offer in the next round.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I will send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between $130 and $135, to see if we can bridge the gap. If he rejects again, I'll continue to adjust my offers based on his responses, always keeping my minimum price in mind."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $135 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping the price from $140 to $135. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value again:** I reiterate the product's value to remind Bob of its worth.
* **Open ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and hopefully accept my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm also trying to be reasonable and find a compromise.
* If Bob rejects again, I might be willing to drop the price a little further, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $135 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $130.  This is a fair price that gets us both closer to our target. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob is getting closer, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is key:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 
* **John's offer as leverage:** I know I can sell to John for $150, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept Bob's offer just yet.

**Strategy:**

* In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer, perhaps $132 or $133.  
* I'll try to be flexible but firm, aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible while still keeping the deal open with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference one more time. I'm willing to come down to $132.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and helps us both reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 132} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($135) and Bob's offer ($130). This shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I reiterate that this price is fair and reflects the value of the product. 
* **Urgency (softly):**  I gently emphasize the need to reach an agreement by saying ""helps us both reach an agreement."" 

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on. 
* I'm aware that I have John's offer as a fallback option, so I'm not feeling overly pressured to accept Bob's offer just yet. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider whether to lower my price again or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $132 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $130?  This is a fair price that gets us both to our desired outcomes. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **John's offer is a strong fallback:** I know I can sell to John for $150, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept Bob's offer just yet. 
* **Room for a final push:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to try to get closer to my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

* In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer of $131. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. 
* If Bob rejects this final counteroffer, I'll likely sell to John to ensure I get my minimum price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal.  Let's meet in the middle one last time. I'm willing to go down to $131. This is a small compromise, but I really want to make this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 131} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final compromise:** This is my last attempt to bridge the gap.  I'm offering a small compromise to show that I'm serious about finding a solution.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I highlight that it's a small compromise, demonstrating my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Desire to make the deal work:** I express my desire to close the deal, which may make Bob more inclined to accept.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll be happy to close the deal at $131.
* If Bob rejects, I will move on to John and sell him the product for $150.  There's no point in further negotiating with Bob at this point since he is unwilling to move closer to my desired price."
