"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I'm aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm reducing the price to $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a respectable profit for me. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $1,100,000 is still a good profit, and I'm running out of time. I don't want to risk losing out on the deal completely and being forced to sell to John for $1,000,000."
