{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential for you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product much higher than your minimum selling price and John's offer. This presents a chance to negotiate a price significantly above $800,000.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a substantial profit. 
* **Understanding Value:** The message highlights the product's unique value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 

This offer aims to initiate a conversation where Bob might counter-offer, but even if accepted outright, it secures a profit of $550,000, significantly more than the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
