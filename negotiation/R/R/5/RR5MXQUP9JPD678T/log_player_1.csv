Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:** This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000. It reflects my desire to maximize my earnings.
* **Rationale:**
    * While I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a calculated risk. 
    * If Bob values the product highly enough to pay the higher price, I make a substantial profit. 
    * If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:** If possible, I would try to gather information about the market value of the product or similar products to make a more informed pricing decision. 
* **Bob's Situation:**  Knowing anything about Bob's financial situation or need for this product could influence my offer. 
* **Negotiation:** If Bob expresses interest but not at the full price, I might be willing to negotiate slightly."
