"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting point while also leaving some wiggle room to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want for the product. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000, which is still a good profit for me while being closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting very close.  It's a good profit for me, and we're only on round 4, so continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer altogether.  It's time to accept and move on."
