Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I think I can get closer to my goal of $10,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering what the product is worth."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to accept it to close the deal.  I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
