# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident that this investment will yield substantial returns for you.

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product.  I believe this price is fair considering its value and my own limitations."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my best offer, as it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial one, it's still far beyond my budget. It's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer to try and bring the price closer to my acceptable range."
