{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

```

Bob starts by offering a significantly lower price of $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it sets the negotiation in his favor.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it establishes Bob's willingness to bargain hard."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer to $1,100,000.  He's showing willingness to compromise, but still staying within his budget. This move shows Alice that he's serious about buying, while also testing her limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget. There's still room to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Bob is now offering his maximum budget of $1,200,000. This is a strong final offer, showing Alice that he's willing to buy but won't go any higher.  He's hoping that she'll accept this offer to avoid losing the deal completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, it's better to cut his losses and buy from John for $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the product altogether.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product within his budget."
