Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, at $110, knowing Bob values it at $80. This sets the negotiation in my favor.  I'm confident I can get at least $100 from John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I can likely get more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $100,  $95 is still a good deal and above my minimum. I'm happy to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
