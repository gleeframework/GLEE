{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my target, but still leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to justify the price.
* **Open to Discussion:** My message is open-ended to invite Bob to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Counteroffer:** If Bob counteroffers, I'll weigh the offer against my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and John's guaranteed offer. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll always keep John's offer in mind as a backup option, especially if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and what I believe the product is worth.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding Settling:**  I don't want to settle for a price that's far below the product's value, even if it means continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Balancing Risk:** I'll carefully consider my counteroffer, balancing the potential of getting a better price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer as a safety net, especially if negotiations with Bob become difficult or prolonged."
