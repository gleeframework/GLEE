"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This allows me to make a decent profit and you get a high-value product at a competitive price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise. This gives you a good profit and allows me to acquire the product at a price I'm comfortable with. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 just doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $885,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",885000.0,Alice,5,
