Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $18,000 offer leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to lower the price slightly while still staying above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value (""given its value and potential"") to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he immediately rejects the $18,000, you can always propose a lower price, knowing you have John as a backup."
