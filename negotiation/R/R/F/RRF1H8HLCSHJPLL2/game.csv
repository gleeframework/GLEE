"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I've done some research, and I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $9,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about $9,400? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure $9,400 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,300?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",9300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,150, but no higher. I think that's a fair price considering what I'm looking for.",9150.0,Bob,8,
