"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product offers. While I appreciate your offer of $1,200,000, I must be honest that it falls quite a bit short of what I had in mind. To make this work, I would need to see your offer closer to $1,800,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end but demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget of $800,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
