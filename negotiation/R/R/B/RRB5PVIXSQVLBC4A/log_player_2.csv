"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price considering its market value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000), it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts on this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above your budget.  You're close to your desired price of $1,000,000, so it's worth pushing for a lower price with a counteroffer. There's a good chance Alice will accept a price slightly higher than what John is offering."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above what I'm able to pay right now.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $1,025,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase at that price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your latest offer. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1025000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,075,000 is still above your budget. While you're close to your goal, you don't want to overspend. John offers the product for $1,000,000, which is within your budget and the best option at this point. You can always try to negotiate with Alice again in the future if the need arises."
