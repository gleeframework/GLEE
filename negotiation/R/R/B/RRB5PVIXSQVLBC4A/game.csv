"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to secure the product for a slightly lower price.  Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950000.  I believe this price is fair, and we can both benefit from a successful transaction.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit above what I'm able to pay right now.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $1025000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase at that price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your latest offer. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1025000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
