"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's true value of $1,500,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm definitely interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and it would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1150000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is closer to his desired price, it's still higher than his maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue trying to push for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  I see we're getting closer. I'm still aiming to stay within my budget though, and I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while allowing us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1125000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,125,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the sure thing and buy from John at $1,000,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price, and Bob might end up paying even more."
