"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1400000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $950000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
