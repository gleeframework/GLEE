"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $14,500 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,500 is a bit above my budget. How about $13,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. How about $14,000? I believe this price is fair, considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price.  There's still room for further negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit hesitant at $14,000. Would you consider $13,750? I believe this is a fair compromise, and it fits within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $13,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $13,900?  That's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,900 is getting very close to Bob's desired price range, and it's still considerably lower than what Bob would pay from John ($15,000).  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially ending in a higher price or a failed deal.  While there's still a small chance of negotiating further, the risk of losing the deal or ending up with a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
