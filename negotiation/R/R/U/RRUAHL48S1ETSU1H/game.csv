"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,500 is a bit above my budget. How about $13,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. How about $14,000? I believe this price is fair, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
