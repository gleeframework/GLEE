"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $14,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to the maximum I believe Bob is willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to Bob without revealing my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price as close to $15,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that John is a backup option. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,500 is a bit above my budget. How about $13,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation with Bob. I believe I can get a better price.
* **Strategic Move:** Rejecting Bob's offer signals that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm confident in the product's value.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired $14,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. How about $14,000? I believe this price is fair, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the value proposition of the product to justify the price.
* **Open Ended:** I'm using an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and potentially a quicker agreement.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle. If he accepts, I've achieved a good price. If he rejects, I'll continue negotiating, keeping in mind that John is a viable backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit hesitant at $14,000. Would you consider $13,750? I believe this is a fair compromise, and it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum desired price of $12,000, but I'm still hesitant to accept.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Strategic Move:** Rejecting again shows Bob that I'm committed to getting a fair price and not desperate to sell.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $14,000. I'll also factor in the risk of losing Bob entirely and having to accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $13,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $13,900?  That's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession to show flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm stressing the ""compromise"" aspect, implying that this is a final offer and showing I'm willing to meet in the middle. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping a friendly tone, emphasizing the goal of reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

At this point, I'm gauging Bob's willingness to close the deal. If he accepts, I've achieved a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll need to weigh the risk of losing him against the potential of getting a better offer in the next round or accepting John's offer."
