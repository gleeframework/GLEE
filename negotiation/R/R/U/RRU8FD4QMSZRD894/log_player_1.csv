Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the asking price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (your minimum acceptable price),  it's strategic to start negotiations significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, it emphasizes exclusivity and confidence in the product's value. This might encourage Bob to justify the higher price in his mind. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts this initial offer, you gain a significant profit margin. If he rejects it, you can always negotiate down, knowing John provides a safety net at $1,200,000."
