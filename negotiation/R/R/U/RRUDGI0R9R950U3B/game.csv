"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it.  This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've outlined.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I am pleased to counter with an offer of $1250000. This price reflects the value we place on our product and the benefits it provides. I hope this aligns more closely with your budget while still allowing us to fairly compensate for the quality and features of our offering. Please let me know if this proposal is acceptable, or if there's anything else I can provide to facilitate our discussion.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1250000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1125000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of your product and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
