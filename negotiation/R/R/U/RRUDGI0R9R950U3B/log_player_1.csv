Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it.  This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've outlined.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
