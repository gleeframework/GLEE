Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still ensures you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding ""limited time"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision."
