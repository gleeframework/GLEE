"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $600,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be open to a price of $950,000? This takes into account the value this product brings while acknowledging your budget considerations.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant jump from my initial offer.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $750,000 is too low for me. How about we settle at $850,000? I believe this price reflects a balance between the true value of the product and our mutual desire to reach a deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me.  That said, I have a hard limit at $800,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to buy today.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with a different option.",800000.0,Bob,6,
