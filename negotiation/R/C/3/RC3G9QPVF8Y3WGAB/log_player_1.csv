Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $90 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $95 for this round. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the new offer. I'm still not convinced it's the best deal for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than his last offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob, but I still have some rounds left. I'll try to push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just too low. I'm willing to go down to $92 for this round, but that's my final offer. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:**  We're already at round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left. 
* **Bob's offers are getting lower:**  He's not moving significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:**  John offers a price that meets my minimum, and it's a sure thing.

While I'd like to get a little more than $120, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal. Selling to John guarantees my minimum, and I have to prioritize my own financial goals."
