``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my profit.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel valued.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for better negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I retain control of the negotiation and demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair price.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap while still ensuring a profitable deal for myself."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's position:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal to build rapport and show I'm listening to his concerns.
* **Counter with a firm but reasonable price:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial proposal.  
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us, highlighting the value he'll receive from the product.

This counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining my bottom line.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to make a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round."

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still $200,000 less than my minimum acceptable price.
