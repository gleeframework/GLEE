"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it's still a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is my final offer. If you accept, we can close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, and I'm willing to make one last concession.  However, $1,000,000 is still below my bottom line.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,025,000.  This price represents a significant compromise on my part and gives us a solid basis for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
