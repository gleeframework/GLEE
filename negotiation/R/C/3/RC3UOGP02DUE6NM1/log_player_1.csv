Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, considering its potential worth of $1,000,000. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price of $900,000. It's a win-win situation, allowing me to maximize my returns while providing you with a profitable investment. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  I will counter-offer and try to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer, but I need to stay above my minimum price point. I'm offering $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $650,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this product, but I need a price that reflects its true value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm running out of time.  John's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm better off selling to him now."
