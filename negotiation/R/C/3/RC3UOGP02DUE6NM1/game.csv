"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, considering its potential worth of $1,000,000. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price of $900,000. It's a win-win situation, allowing me to maximize my returns while providing you with a profitable investment. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer, but I need to stay above my minimum price point. I'm offering $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's make it happen!",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $650,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this product, but I need a price that reflects its true value to me.",650000.0,Bob,4,
