"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its many features and benefits, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has some nice features, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $14,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly agree on $10,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to consider it if we can meet somewhere in the middle. Would you be open to $12,500? This would allow me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. $12,500 is close, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. It seems we're getting close.  I'd be willing to come down slightly to $11,750.  This is truly as low as I can go while still feeling good about the deal.",11750.0,Alice,7,
