Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a slight deal. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even if it means a slightly lower profit than waiting for John. 

**Important Note:** This assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or other factors that might influence his decision."
