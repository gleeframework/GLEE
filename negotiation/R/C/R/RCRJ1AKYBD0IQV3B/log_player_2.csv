"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $10,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it provides, I am extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special price of $9,500. This offer is designed to ensure you receive the best value while also allowing us to share in the mutual benefits of this transaction. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly aiming high to maximize her profit. Her offer of $9,500 is significantly more than her own valuation of the product ($8,000).
* You have a backup option with John at $10,000. While this is your maximum, there's room to negotiate with Alice further. 
* By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and open the possibility for her to make a counter-offer closer to your desired price range."
