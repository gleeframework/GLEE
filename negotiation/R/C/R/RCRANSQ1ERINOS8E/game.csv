"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I know this is a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and it's a good price for me as well. Let me know if you're interested!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something around $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers,  how about $887,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",887500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $887,500. I'm willing to go up to $882,500, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",882500.0,Bob,6,
