{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I know this is a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and it's a good price for me as well. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This gives you some leeway to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to be flexible:** This shows Bob that you are open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

Remember, the key is to start high, but not too high, and be prepared to negotiate. You want to maximize your profits, but also ensure that Bob doesn't walk away entirely."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something around $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to ensure I get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $900,000.  Here's why:

* **Compromise:** It's a compromise from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above Bob's offer:** It demonstrates I'm not willing to go down to his initial offer.
* **Fair deal for both:**  $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his perceived value, while it gets me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm not yet willing to settle for less than $900,000, especially with John offering me my full asking price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to ensure I get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers,  how about $887,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 887500}
```

I'm offering $887,500, which is the midpoint between my last offer ($900,000) and Bob's last offer ($875,000).  This shows a continued willingness to compromise while still being within a range that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $887,500. I'm willing to go up to $882,500, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $882,500 is getting close to my target price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000. I've already made several concessions and Bob seems unwilling to budge further.  With John offering me my full asking price, it's time to move on and sell to him.  It's a safer and more profitable option."
