# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is under your $10,000 limit, you can do better.  You're better off rejecting this offer to see if Alice will come down in price or going with your backup option of John."
