"That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I'm very interested in the product but my budget is much lower. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000? That's the absolute maximum I can afford at the moment.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go.",16000.0,Alice,5,
