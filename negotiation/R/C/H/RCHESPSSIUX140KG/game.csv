"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130, as I mentioned earlier, or even $132.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $132.5 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $133.75.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this deal!",133.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $133.75. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $133, but I think I can do even better than that. I'll make a final offer of $132.50, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",132.5,Bob,6,
