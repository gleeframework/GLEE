{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $140 is higher than Bob's $120 valuation, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $140 is still above your minimum of $150, ensuring you make a profit.

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, we create a space for negotiation while ensuring we still gain a reasonable profit."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130, as I mentioned earlier, or even $132.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $132.5 is better than Bob's initial offer, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value. I'm confident I can secure a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $132.5 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $133.75.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $133.75. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $133, but I think I can do even better than that. I'll make a final offer of $132.50, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is clearly not willing to go higher than $132.50. While this offer is still above his initial valuation of $120, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rather than continue negotiating and risking a lower price, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $150, ensuring I reach my desired profit."
