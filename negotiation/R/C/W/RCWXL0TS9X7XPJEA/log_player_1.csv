Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a little lower than I'd hoped, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'd like to try to get closer to my target. How about $108? Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $108. While it's still a bit below what I'd hoped for, it's close to my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
