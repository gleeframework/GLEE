{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique and valuable asset.  I believe this product holds immense potential for you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business.  My initial offer is $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I do believe this is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price than you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down. 
* **Confidence & Value:**  Highlighting the product's value and potential can make Bob more eager to buy.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Stating you're open to discussion shows you're flexible, which can be appealing to a buyer. 
* **The John Factor:**  Remember, you have a safety net with John, so you're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1100000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential of this product and my ability to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob is interested, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me the power to walk away if needed. 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to be flexible, and I truly believe this product's potential is worth more than that.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm prepared to accept $1,300,000.  This price reflects both the product's value and your financial capabilities.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** While still above Bob's offer, $1,300,000 shows a willingness to negotiate. It's a significant step closer to his offer but keeps the price above my minimum threshold.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reminding Bob about the potential of the product reinforces the value proposition. 
* **Mid-Point:**  The counteroffer is a mid-point between my initial price and Bob's, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a fair deal. 
* **Direct Approach:** The message is direct and clear, focusing on the proposed price and leaving space for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1300000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000. This reflects my maximum budget while still acknowledging the potential value of this product. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I would prefer a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob might result in a lower offer or a drawn-out process.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The longer I negotiate, the longer I'm delaying the sale and potentially losing out on other opportunities.

Accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and secures a sale at a price that is reasonably close to my minimum acceptable price."
