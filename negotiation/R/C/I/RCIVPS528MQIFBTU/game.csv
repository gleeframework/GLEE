"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1100000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential of this product and my ability to pay.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to be flexible, and I truly believe this product's potential is worth more than that.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm prepared to accept $1300000.  This price reflects both the product's value and your financial capabilities.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1300000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000. This reflects my maximum budget while still acknowledging the potential value of this product. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
