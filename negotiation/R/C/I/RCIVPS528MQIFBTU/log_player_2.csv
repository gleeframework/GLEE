Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.

This price reflects both the product's value and your financial capabilities.  What do you think?

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's closer to your budget, but it's still better to try and negotiate a lower price. 

You have the option of buying from John for $1,200,000, so there's no reason to accept an offer higher than that."
