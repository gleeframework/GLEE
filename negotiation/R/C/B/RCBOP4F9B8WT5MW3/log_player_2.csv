Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $108. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is unlikely to go below $105, and even at $108, it's not worth the potential savings of a few dollars for the extra hassle. You have a guaranteed offer for $100 from John, which meets your needs."
