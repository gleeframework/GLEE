"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1400000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired selling point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  $1300000 is my absolute bottom line.  This price still represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident this product will bring you substantial returns. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is still a bit outside my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
