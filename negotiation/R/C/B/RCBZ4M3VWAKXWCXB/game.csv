"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer in its field and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I agree this product has potential, $1800000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum, but still a bit above your offer. How about $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1100000. Let's bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. Can we meet in the middle at $1200000?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
