"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would still be a great price for you, and a fair deal for me.

Alice is coming down, but the price is still higher than what John offers. It's worth negotiating a bit more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm happy to sell it to you for $8,250. This is a good deal for both of us and allows us to finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,250.  At this point, it's better to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
