"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, considering the value we both agree on. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant step closer to my initial offer.  Let's try to close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",885000.0,Alice,5,
