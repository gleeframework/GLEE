"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I really want to get the product for as low as possible. Can you meet me halfway?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a significant discount and a fair offer considering the product's value.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $70? I'm really interested in getting this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $90, but that's my absolute final offer.  It's a fantastic deal for this product.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet in the middle. How about $85? I'm really interested in getting this product, and I'm willing to compromise to make it work.",85.0,Bob,6,
