"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, we aim to anchor the negotiation in our favor. This sets the stage for potential concessions while still aiming for a price well above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, further reinforcing the high starting point.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price leaves ample room for negotiation over the subsequent rounds, allowing you to strategically move towards a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy is about maximizing your potential gain while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, which isn't surprising after only one round.  We need to negotiate upwards to bridge the gap between his offer and your minimum acceptable price. Selling to John right now would meet your minimum, but there's potential to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This offer reflects a more realistic price point while acknowledging the value you'd be gaining."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a substantial concession ($200,000) to demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, we're still keeping the price well above both Bob's offer and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value and frames the concession as a strategic move rather than a desperate one.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counter-offer still leaves room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds, allowing you to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to your target price.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below what John is offering. We have time to negotiate, and Bob increasing his offer shows he's willing to pay more. Let's see if we can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Framing):** By positioning this counteroffer as ""meeting halfway,"" we create a sense of fairness and compromise, even though the price is still closer to our initial offer than Bob's.
* **Final Significant Concession:** This concession is substantial ($200,000), signaling that we're serious about closing the deal but not willing to go much lower. 
* **Maintaining Above John's Offer:** This price point keeps us above John's guaranteed offer, maximizing potential gains.

This counteroffer aims to create a sense of urgency while still allowing for minor adjustments if needed in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now $100,000 higher than what John is guaranteeing. 
* **Good Faith:**  Bob has consistently increased his offers, demonstrating a genuine interest in the product.
* **Time Remaining:**  While there are rounds left, there's no guarantee Bob will continue to increase his offer significantly.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk him walking away. 

Taking this offer secures a profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation."
