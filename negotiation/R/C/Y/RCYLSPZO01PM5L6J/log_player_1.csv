Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Motivating Language:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've earned a good price.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing negotiations or selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you consider selling the product to me for $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range.
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I'm confident I can get a higher price if I continue negotiating. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $10,000 provides me with a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. My goal is to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your interest, I'm unable to go lower than $9,000.  This price still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but not by a huge margin. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to see the price as a good deal.
* **Openness to Agreement:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've secured a decent price that's closer to my target.
* **Bob Rejects:** I will have to assess the situation carefully. If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll likely move on to John to sell for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $8,750 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not a price I'm happy with. 
* **Opportunity to Improve:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price by continuing the conversation.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I have the option of selling to John for a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $9,000. My goal is to find a compromise that is closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about $8,900? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to accommodate your budget while still getting a good price for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's directly in between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's latest offer ($8,750). This shows a genuine willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Fairness and Value:**  I'm highlighting the fairness of the price, emphasizing that it's good for both of us. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm using encouraging language (""What do you think?"") to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price that's closer to my desired range and acceptable to Bob.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll have to carefully consider Bob's next offer and whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $10,000."
