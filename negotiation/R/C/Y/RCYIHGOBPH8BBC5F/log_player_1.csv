Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob's likely to see value in getting the product for less than $12,000. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired price point.  You're not desperate to sell, so it's worth trying to get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $9,000 might have been a bit low.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! It's significantly higher than your minimum and it's only $500 less than your initial offer.  You're likely not going to get much higher than this, and Bob's already shown a willingness to negotiate.  It's time to close the deal!"
