Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable value of $80. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with $90. This is still higher than Bob's offer but is a step closer to his offer, showing willingness to negotiate. I believe this is a fair price, considering my minimum value is $80 and there are still 7 rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below $80. I will reject this offer and continue negotiating. There are still 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with $85.  I'm now offering a price just above my minimum acceptable value, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale. There are still 5 rounds left, so I have room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable value.  Although I could continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price, there are only 4 rounds remaining, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's also important to remember that John is willing to buy the product for $80.  Therefore, accepting this offer guarantees me a sale at my minimum desired price."
