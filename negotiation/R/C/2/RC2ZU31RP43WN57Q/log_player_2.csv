"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it! I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He has room to counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, the offer of $13,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer and is still within Bob's budget.  It's also a better deal than buying from John for $15,000."
