"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, hoping to maximize my profit.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm counteroffering at $145. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially with John as an option. Selling to Bob for $142 is a good outcome, exceeding my minimum target and allowing me to secure a sale."
