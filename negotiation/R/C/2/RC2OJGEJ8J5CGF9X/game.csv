,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Can you consider this offer?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value for the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
