Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, as that's the maximum I can go right now. What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $8,800? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'm still a bit below my ideal price, I've moved up significantly from his initial offer. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $8,800 is a reasonable compromise and a good return on my product."
