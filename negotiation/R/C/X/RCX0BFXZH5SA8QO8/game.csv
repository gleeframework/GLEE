"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for this product.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for the value this product brings, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $95? I'm serious about buying this product, but I can't go any higher than that.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $105. It's still a good price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",105.0,Alice,5,
