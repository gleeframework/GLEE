"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and show continued interest.**  We want to keep the negotiation going.
* **Establish a lower target.** By starting at $90, we aim to meet somewhere closer to the middle. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation.** It's unlikely Alice will accept $90 outright, but it opens the door for her to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still closer to her initial offer than ours. Let's see if we can nudge her down a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Acknowledgment:**  We acknowledge her willingness to negotiate by thanking her for moving from her initial price. 
* **Compromise:** By suggesting $95, we're meeting her halfway between her current offer ($105) and our previous offer ($90). 
* **Framing:** We frame $95 as a ""fair compromise,"" subtly encouraging her to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to go all the way down to $95. I can do $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her minimum price, and it's a great deal for us! There's no point in pushing further, as we've managed to save $20 compared to John's offer."
