"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth much more than my asking price. Given this, I'm proposing an initial offer of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $750,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet halfway at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $875,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $812,500. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",812500.0,Bob,4,
