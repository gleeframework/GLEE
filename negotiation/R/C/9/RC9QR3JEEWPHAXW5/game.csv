"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,350,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I can bring to the product and the price you're willing to meet me at.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I respect that.  However, I need to be fair to myself as well.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,300,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
