"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, knowing Bob is willing to pay up to $80. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also trying to be friendly and positive, hoping to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $95? That's a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough to him, and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting close to my minimum, $85 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $85 is just too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90, which is a slight increase from Bob's last offer. I'm trying to show flexibility while also sticking to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $100.  Bob's offer of $82 is below my minimum acceptable price, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a lower price or no sale at all. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
