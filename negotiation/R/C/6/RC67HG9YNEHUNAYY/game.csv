"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum. Let me know if you're open to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not convinced that $9,500 is a good price for the product. I'm willing to consider a slightly higher price, but I need to think about the value it will bring to your business. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,5,
