"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm open to negotiations, but I have a starting price in mind. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $900000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
