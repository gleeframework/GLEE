"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is way too high for me. I'm more interested in a price closer to $6,000 for this product.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $10,500 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end. While I'm committed to finding a fair price, I need to be upfront: my absolute lowest price for this product is $9,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it reflects the true value you'll gain.",9000.0,Alice,5,
