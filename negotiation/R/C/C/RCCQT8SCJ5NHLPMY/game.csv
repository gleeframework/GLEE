"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I believe a price of $1500000 is slightly above what I'm currently willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product while still being a fair amount for both of us. Would you be open to discussing this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
