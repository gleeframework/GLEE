"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $11000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one last time.",11000.0,Bob,6,
