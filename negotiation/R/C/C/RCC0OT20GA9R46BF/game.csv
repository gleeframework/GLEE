"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $90? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we make it a deal at $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
