"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $110, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This sets the stage for negotiation, and allows me to potentially reach a price closer to my minimum of $100.  I'm also optimistic and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I need to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  While $60 is not ideal, I'm not ready to sell to John just yet.  I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $90? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counter-offering at $90, which is still above my minimum of $100 but closer to Bob's offer. I'm emphasizing the value he'd get at that price, hoping to incentivize him to come up.  My message also remains positive and friendly, aiming to maintain a good negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $60 is low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob higher.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still potential to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counter-offering at $85, which is exactly in the middle of my last offer ($90) and Bob's offer ($75). This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate. My message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of this price, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise. I'm also reiterating the desire to ""close the deal"" to increase urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we make it a deal at $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, so I'll accept it. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $100 or continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal altogether.  I'm also recognizing that pushing for a higher price might lead to a stalemate, which would be detrimental to both of us."
