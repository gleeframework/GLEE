(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. There's no harm in rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to test the waters and see how flexible Alice is.  This offer is significantly lower than the original price, and it provides room for negotiation while still being within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her original offer, but it's still within my range for negotiating further.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $80, and rejecting this offer allows for more negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $85. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still aiming for a price that's within my budget. This is a good compromise point, and hopefully, Alice will find it acceptable."
