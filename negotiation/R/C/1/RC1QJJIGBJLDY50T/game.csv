"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is my best offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is my best counteroffer, and I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
