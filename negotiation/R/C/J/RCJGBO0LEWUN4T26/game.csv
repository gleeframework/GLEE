"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
