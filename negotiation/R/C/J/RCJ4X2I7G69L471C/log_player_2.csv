"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150 and Alice is offering the product at that price, there is no incentive to negotiate. Buying from John ensures you get the product at your budget limit."
