"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking that $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, so I'm offering $9,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need the price to be lower. Would you consider $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $9,500. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'm offering $9,350. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",9350.0,Alice,7,
