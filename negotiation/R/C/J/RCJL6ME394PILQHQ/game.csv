"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would you be willing to come down a little further?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're aiming for a lower price. I'm willing to go down a little further, but $1,150,000 is just not workable for me. How about we meet at $1,200,000? This is a fair compromise, and allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
