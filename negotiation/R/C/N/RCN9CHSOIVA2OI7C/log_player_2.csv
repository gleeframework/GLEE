"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is way above my budget of $800,000.  I need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,300,000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it. This is my maximum offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below its market value and what I'm looking to receive for this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a substantial concession on my part, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $2,000,000 is still far beyond my budget.  I need to continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about reaching an agreement, and I appreciate that.  Your offer moves us closer, but we're still not quite there yet.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to consider $1,700,000.  This is a significant move on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal considering the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is still higher than my budget.  While it's a significant move on her part, I need to continue negotiating to try to get closer to my target price. I'm confident I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us. Your offer is moving in the right direction, but it's still a considerable distance from my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still well above my budget.  While I've made progress in the negotiation, it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable price. To avoid wasting more time, I'm going to buy the product from John for $800,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation that might not yield a better result."
