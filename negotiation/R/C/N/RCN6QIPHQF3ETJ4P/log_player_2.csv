{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  $12,000 is a good start, but you can likely do better."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start by making a bold counteroffer.  $10,000 is a significant discount, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. Hopefully, Alice will be willing to negotiate from here."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $11,000. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better deal. Hopefully, Alice will see that we're close to a deal and be willing to compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still not budging much, but I'm still not ready to give up. I'll try one more counteroffer before seriously considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm going to raise my offer to $11,500.  This is a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm willing to meet her halfway. Hopefully, this will convince her to close the deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where negotiating with Alice is getting frustrating.  I'm not confident I can get the price down much further, and I'm already halfway through my rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $15,000."
