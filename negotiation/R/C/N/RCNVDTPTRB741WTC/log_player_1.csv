"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My initial offer is $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value for the product, hoping to get a quick deal. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is far below what I need for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $100? It's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
I'm still trying to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware that I need to be flexible to reach a deal. I've lowered my price significantly from the previous round, but I'm still confident that I can secure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price point. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better offer from Bob or if I should move on to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this work. Let's find a way to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm trying to stay above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and Bob will accept. If not, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Would you consider $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150, I'll choose to sell the product to John."
