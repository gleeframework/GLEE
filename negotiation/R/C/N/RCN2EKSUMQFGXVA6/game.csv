"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. I'm happy to continue discussing, but I'm really not comfortable going much lower than $110.  Let me know if you're willing to budge a bit, or I might need to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me halfway and offer $108? That's the best I can do.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to go down to $109, but that's my final offer. If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",109.0,Alice,7,
