Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($100) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Ensure a Sale:** Offering it for a price significantly lower than $90 risks leaving money on the table.  

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
