"Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's a fair price, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is my final offer, let's make a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $100 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $105 for the product. This is a fair compromise and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
