Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with my desired price of $1,000,000. I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so this is a high starting point.  However, I want to see if he's willing to negotiate upwards. If he rejects, I'll have to assess whether to counter or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm going to try and counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial price but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be seen as reasonable and bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is getting too low for me. It's significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  At this point, I'm going to accept John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's not ideal, but it's the best outcome given Bob's unwillingness to negotiate closer to my desired price."
