Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal.  This product offers immense value, and I believe $1,400,000 is a more appropriate reflection of that. Let's find a middle ground."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is moving closer to my desired price point, and we're getting into the later rounds. Accepting $1,300,000 now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
