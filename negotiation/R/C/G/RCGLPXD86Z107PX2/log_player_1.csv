Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I want to see if I can maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Since he's offering my minimum price, I'll take it to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection."
