"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate down from this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is far too low. It's less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,500,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and hopefully closer to a price that Bob might find appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and try for a better price in the next round.  I'm also starting to consider the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, as the negotiations with Bob are becoming increasingly difficult."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,300,000. This is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a more reasonable offer in the next round. If he doesn't, I'm seriously considering selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm also keeping the option of selling to John in mind.  I'm starting to run out of time and don't want to risk settling for a price that is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is right above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go lower. If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $1,200,000.  The risk of continuing the negotiation is too high at this point. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob is too high. There's no guarantee he'll increase his offer, and I might end up with a price lower than John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
