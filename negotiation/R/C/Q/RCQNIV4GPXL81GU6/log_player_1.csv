Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if listed publicly, giving Bob an incentive to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?"") suggesting a willingness to negotiate, which might be necessary to secure the deal with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still maintaining a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
