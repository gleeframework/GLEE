Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I know I can get $8,000 from John, so I won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000. Offering $12,000 is a good compromise, giving him a significant discount while still earning a substantial profit for me.
* **Negotiation room:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $8,000. This provides a buffer and allows for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers."
