"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $110? That's still a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $107. This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $107 is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $109. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $109 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $107. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. 

Even though I was hoping to get closer to $120 with Bob, it seems like we've reached an impasse. There's only a $2 difference between what I'm willing to accept and what Bob is willing to pay, and it's not worth risking another round of negotiation. 

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
