"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $175. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Attractive Offer:**  $175 is a significant discount from my perceived value, making it potentially appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to a better agreement. How about $140 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a step closer to my minimum, $140 is still below my minimum threshold of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. If I can't, I'll be happy to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155? It's a fair price that values both our positions."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer to Bob, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also maintaining my minimum price.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering $155 is a middle ground between my previous offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($140).
* **Fair and Reasonable:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, giving me more time to secure a better price before potentially resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe we can still negotiate further. Would $145 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Close to John's Offer:**  I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before accepting John's deal.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still a chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $145 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $150 - that's my absolute minimum, and it's still a great deal for you. "", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** I'm making a final counteroffer at my minimum acceptable price, $150.
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is direct and clear, leaving no room for misinterpretation. 
* **Attractive to Bob:**  While it's my minimum, it's still a good deal for Bob, considering he values the product at $80. 
* **Pressure Point:**  This offer puts pressure on Bob to decide, as it's my final stand.  If he rejects it, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to what I'm comfortable with. Would $142 be within your range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $142 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We are approaching the halfway point in the negotiations, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $150 is secure and meets my minimum requirement.  

It's time to secure the guaranteed sale to John.  While I would prefer to get a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  I'll take John's offer and move on."
