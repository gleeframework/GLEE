"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I want to see if I can push him up a little more before considering John's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of this product.  How about $8,500?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6500 for it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway.  If he doesn't, I'll go with John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $6500 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $7500 is still a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $6000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've reached my limit with Bob's counteroffers. He's not getting close enough to my minimum price, and I don't want to waste any more time. John's offer of $8,000 is a fair price, and I'm going to take it."
