Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $7000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of this product.  How about $8500?  This would give us both a good deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $6500 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $7500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product.
