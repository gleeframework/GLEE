"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  I'm offering it to you for $10000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7000 for it.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $7000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of this product.  How about $8500?  This would give us both a good deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6500 for it.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $6500 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $7500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product.",7500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $7500 is still a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $6000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,6,
