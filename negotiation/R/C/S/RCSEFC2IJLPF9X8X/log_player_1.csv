Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if listed publicly, giving Bob an incentive to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice is secure knowing John will buy it for her minimum acceptable price."
