"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraint, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I've been considering my options carefully, and I believe $100 is the maximum I can spend. Could we perhaps meet at $105? I understand if this isn't feasible, but I hope we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above $100. How about we try $108? It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for this unique product.",108.0,Alice,5,
