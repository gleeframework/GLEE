"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit lower than what I want but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is more than Bob thinks the product is worth, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I have 8 more rounds to get a better deal, so I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate. $95 is still a good deal for Bob, and it gets me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit high. I'm happy to pay $90. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not at my minimum acceptable price of $120. I have 6 more rounds to try and get a better deal, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

I'm proposing a compromise at $92.50, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to agree. This is still a good price for me, and it leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
