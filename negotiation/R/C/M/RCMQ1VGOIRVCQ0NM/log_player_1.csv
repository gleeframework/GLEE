**Reasoning:** 

Bob is consistently inching closer to our $1,000,000 minimum acceptable price. However, his increments are getting smaller, and we are still at a point where selling to John is a better guaranteed outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's time to cut our losses and take the sure thing with John."
