"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the product's intrinsic worth and potential for future benefits warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects a fair balance between its value and your initial offer.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer,  I'm confident this product's unique qualities will yield significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's true value.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
