Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep Bob engaged.
* **Not Too Aggressive:** I'm not asking for the full $100 immediately. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $100, so I'm not desperate to make a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a Backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $100 gives me leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from $110.
* **Meeting My Minimum:** $100 is my absolute minimum, and this offer ensures I'm not losing money.
* **Positive Language:** I'm emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Clarity:** I'm stating my price clearly to avoid further back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close But Not Enough:** While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $100.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, and I don't want to risk going below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids the uncertainty of more negotiation rounds."
