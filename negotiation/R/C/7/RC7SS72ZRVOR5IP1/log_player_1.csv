It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  $11,500 is a solid profit above my minimum price.
* **Time Value:** Dragging negotiations longer risks losing Bob altogether. 
* **Uncertainty:** While I could push for more, there's no guarantee Bob will budge, and John's offer is a safety net."
