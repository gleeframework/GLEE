(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than her perceived value ($120), it's still more than your maximum budget of $80 and more expensive than John's offer. You can likely negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy it from John for the best deal."
