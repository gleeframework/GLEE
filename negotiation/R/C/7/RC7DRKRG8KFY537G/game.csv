"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I have to say that $11,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,3,
