"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",925000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $925,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $875,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum.  How about we settle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true value while still providing you a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference; I'll come down to $875,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other interested buyers at this price point if needed.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is the best we can both agree on, considering the product's value to me and the market value.",850000.0,Bob,6,
