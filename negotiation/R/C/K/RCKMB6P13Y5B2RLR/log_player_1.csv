Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $925,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is the best we can both agree on, considering the product's value to me and the market value.

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is unlikely to budge beyond $850,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000) and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or losing Bob as a buyer."
