"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $9,000.  Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential deal, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $8,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on $8,750? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice's offer of $8,750 is still below Bob's maximum budget of $10,000 and above Alice's minimum of $8,000, suggesting a reasonable deal.
* **Compromise:** Alice demonstrated willingness to compromise, moving from $9,000 to $8,750.
* **Risk:**  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but also risks Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures a good deal for Bob."
