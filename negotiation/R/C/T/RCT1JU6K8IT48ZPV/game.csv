"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm starting at $900,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is valuable, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a lot, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for you. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential for you. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, this product has great potential. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000 even. I think that's a really fair price and shows how serious I am about acquiring this product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,6,
