Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is valuable, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

Round 6
