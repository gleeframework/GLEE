Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and while it's worth a significant amount to me, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm asking for $950,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $950,000 leaves room for negotiation and ensures I still get a decent profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price is higher than Bob's value, but not so high that he'd immediately reject. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  The message indicates flexibility, prompting Bob to potentially counteroffer.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I won't accept a counteroffer lower than $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* **John is a better option:**  I can immediately sell to John for $1,000,000, making it a more lucrative choice than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, rejecting it allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low for me. Given the product's value and our initial discussions, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've lowered my price to $850,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product, justifying the price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While lower than my initial offer, $850,000 is still above Bob's valuation, allowing me to maintain some leverage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for further negotiation, inviting Bob to counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **No significant improvement:** While Bob is coming closer to my price, the gap is still too large to justify further negotiation.
* **John's offer is the best option:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me the maximum profit and avoids further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
