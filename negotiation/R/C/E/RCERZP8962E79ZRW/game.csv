"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, the price you're suggesting is considerably lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would be a fair price considering the product's true value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really only comfortable going up to $90.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take it.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
