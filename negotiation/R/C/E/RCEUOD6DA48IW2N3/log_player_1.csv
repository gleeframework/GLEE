Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation is helpful, starting with a price closer to your desired outcome ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though you haven't explicitly revealed its worth to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By stating you're ""confident it will exceed your expectations,"" you hint at the possibility of a deal even if Bob initially hesitates at the price. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your desired price, so you're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's perspective."
