"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $90 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price of $100. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $100 is the best option to achieve your goal."
