Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it holds significant value and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's potential to get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident this product holds even more value for you.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $900,000.  This reflects the unique benefits and potential of this product.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've highlighted. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price point.  While $850,000 is still below my initial target, it's a good deal considering:

* I'm already in round 4, meaning I'm running out of time.
* This is a significant increase from his initial offer of $800,000.
*  Accepting this offer is better than selling to John for $800,000."
