"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you proposed doesn't reflect the true potential and unique features this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's unique features, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  To be frank, $1,700,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I value reaching an agreement with you.  Would you be willing to consider $1,800,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and ultimately prove to be a worthwhile investment at this price.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Alice. I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
