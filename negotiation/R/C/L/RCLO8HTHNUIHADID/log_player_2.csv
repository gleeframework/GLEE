"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it for $95. This price reflects its true worth while allowing you to enjoy significant savings. I trust you'll find it to be a valuable investment. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her ($100), it's still more expensive than your maximum budget ($80) and the price John offers ($80). It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the extra money."
