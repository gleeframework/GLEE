Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, but still secures a significant profit for me.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going in with an offer too close to $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could scare him away.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
