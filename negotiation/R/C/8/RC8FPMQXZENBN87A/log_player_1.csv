"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $8,200. This aligns closer to my budget while still reflecting the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want. I'm going to try to push for a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a higher price.  How about $8,800? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it would make this deal work for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. Would $8,600 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again, but if Bob isn't willing to budge much more, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $8,700. I believe that's a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. Considering the ongoing negotiations, I would like to propose a price of $8,650. This seems to be a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, I'm not sure how much more I can push Bob.  $8,650 is only a bit more than his initial offer, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's probably better to accept and secure the sale."
