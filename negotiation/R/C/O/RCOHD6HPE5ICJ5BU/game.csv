"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,025,000? This reflects my need for a fair return on this valuable product while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. It's significantly closer to my budget and still allows you a good return on the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is significant.  I could consider coming down to $980,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",980000.0,Alice,5,
