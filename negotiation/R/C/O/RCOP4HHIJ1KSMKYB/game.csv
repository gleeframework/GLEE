"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for a significant discount and I'll still be able to recoup a good portion of its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to have to counter with $950,000.  This is still a significant discount for you, and it allows me to recoup more of the product's value to me.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit higher than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm offering $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think $850,000 is the most I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",850000.0,Bob,6,
