Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, $78 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $82. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $80, and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $80 price."
