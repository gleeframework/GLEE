Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle above your minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,000,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** This offer assumes you don't know Bob's negotiation tactics. If he's known to be aggressive, you might start slightly lower to avoid scaring him off.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even though you have John as a backup, building a good relationship with Bob could lead to future business opportunities. Consider if a slightly lower price is worth a potentially long-term gain."
