"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below your maximum budget, you know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or even get John to come down a bit. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door to potentially save more money."
