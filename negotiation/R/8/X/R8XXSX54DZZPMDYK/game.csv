"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That way we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $92? This would allow us to stay within my preferred spending limit while still being fair to you.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $92 is still a bit below what I need. Would you be willing to go to $94? It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think!",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I am still aiming to keep the cost under $94. Would it be possible for us to agree on $93? This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle and respect our respective budgets.",93.0,Bob,6,
