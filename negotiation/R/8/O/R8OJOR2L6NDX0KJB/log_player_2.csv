Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9250. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still not willing to come down to your acceptable range. It's getting late in the negotiation, and you're risking going over your budget if you continue. It's best to take the safe option and buy from John."
