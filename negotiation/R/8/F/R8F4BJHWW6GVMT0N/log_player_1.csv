I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a reasonable price that I believe is high enough to potentially make a profit but also low enough to be attractive to Bob. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **My minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so I'm not willing to sell it for less.
* **Potential for profit:**  $15,000 would be a nice profit for me. 
* **Risk and reward:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $12,000.  But, I'm taking a chance that Bob might be willing to pay more. 

This offer balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to avoid losing a sale."
