"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for us both to feel good about the deal. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000. How about $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $787,500 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $812,500. This is a fair price that considers your needs and allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",812500.0,Alice,5,
