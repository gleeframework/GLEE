Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $900,000}

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $700,000. This is lower than my minimum price, and I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $850,000}
