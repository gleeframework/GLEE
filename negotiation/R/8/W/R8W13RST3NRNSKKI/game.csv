"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. Can you meet me at $108? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. But $108 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise.  How about $109? That's only a dollar more than your last offer, and it's closer to my price.  Let's make this happen.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $109 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $109, which would be $108.5. Can you consider that?",108.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $108.50 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $108.75. This is a fair compromise, and it lets us both get a good deal. What do you say?",108.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that $108.75 is a good compromise, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $108.50, which is the same as my previous offer. Can you consider that?",108.5,Bob,8,
