Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth more to Bob ($1,500,000) than it is to you.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You need to find a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also maximizes your profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,350,000 is significantly more than your minimum, giving you a substantial profit. It's also well below Bob's valuation, leaving him with a potential gain.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""fair deal"" and ""potential value"" helps justify the high price without being too aggressive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong starting point, there's always room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could:

* **Start higher:** Aim closer to $1,400,000 if you want to test Bob's willingness to pay top dollar.
* **Offer a more rounded number:**  $1,400,000 might seem more psychologically appealing than $1,350,000 to some buyers. 

The key is to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
