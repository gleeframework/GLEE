Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $950,000 is more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **Lower than Bob's perceived value:** It's still significantly less than the $1,000,000 Bob values the product at, giving him room to negotiate.
* **A clear starting point:**  It sets a clear price and opens the door for a back-and-forth negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by counter-offering.  

**Next Steps:** I'll counter-offer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his counter-offer.  This will keep the negotiation moving forward and demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This is still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $950,000, Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close and a good deal considering his initial offer.  I'm confident that I can still find a way to benefit from the sale. Accepting his offer will allow me to move forward with the transaction and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
