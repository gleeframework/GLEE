"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $100. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120 maximum, and Alice's offer is $100. 
* There's room for negotiation to get a better price. 
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the first offer isn't a risky move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $100 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $95. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120 and Alice is offering $95. This is getting closer to your desired price point.
* You have 7 more rounds of negotiation. There's still room to try and get a lower price, especially since Alice already said she's willing to meet you halfway. 
* You can also use this round to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $92.50. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $97.50. This is as low as I can go, and I'm starting to think it's worth considering other options. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $97.5, which is getting close to your desired price point, but you're still saving $22.5 compared to buying from John.**
* **You have 5 rounds left, but Alice is showing signs of being less flexible. She's explicitly mentioning considering ""other options,"" which indicates a potential risk of losing the deal.**
* **Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price and minimizes the risk of Alice walking away.**"
