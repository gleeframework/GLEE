"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $725,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. Let's meet in the middle at $737,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",737500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $737,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $712,500?  That's halfway between our last two offers.",712500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $720,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we settle at $725,000? This is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",725000.0,Alice,7,
