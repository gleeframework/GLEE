Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly hints at its worth without directly stating Bob's own valuation.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning she'll list it publicly, Alice implies Bob might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act, even though she has John as a backup.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know what you think"" keeps the communication open and invites Bob to counter-offer, starting the negotiation process. 

This approach aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to consider the offer."
