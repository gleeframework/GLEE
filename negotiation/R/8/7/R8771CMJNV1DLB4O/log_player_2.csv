"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about buying but looking for a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,000,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice has come down to John's price. There's no point in negotiating further as it won't save any money."
