"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $11,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $12,000 to $11,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11,000, which is the minimum you mentioned earlier. How about we try $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
