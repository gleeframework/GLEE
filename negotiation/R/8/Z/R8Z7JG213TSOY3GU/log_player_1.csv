{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm going to try to counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $11,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $12,000 to $11,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11,000, which is the minimum you mentioned earlier. How about we try $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While Bob's offer of $11,250 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold.  John's offer is much closer to my desired price, and I'm confident I can find another buyer if this deal falls through."
