# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price. You have the fallback option of buying from John for $1,500,000, but it's worth seeing if Alice will come down closer to your ideal price."
