Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I believe the product's value to you is worth this price, and I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach our target of $800,000 or lower. She's stated this is her lowest offer.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation and potentially missing out on the guaranteed deal with John."
