"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to make this work.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $700,000. I think this is a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I believe the product's value to you is worth this price, and I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
