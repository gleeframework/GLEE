"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is still a relatively high price for Bob. Since there are 10 rounds, it's worth negotiating further to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer of $700,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $900,000, but still above Alice's minimum value of $800,000.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there are still rounds left to negotiate. It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $750,000.  This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise, but also demonstrates that he's not willing to overpay. This should hopefully be a sweet spot that Alice will accept, given that it's still above her minimum value and that there are fewer rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there are still 5 rounds left.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.  Bob should continue to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $775,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice that he is willing to meet her halfway. It's also a good price for Bob, leaving him with a decent profit margin. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's time to get closer to a final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $812,500. This is still above Bob's ideal price, but with only three rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance that Alice will increase her price again, or refuse to negotiate further.  It's a better strategy to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price, rather than risk ending up with a higher price or no deal at all."
