{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really find useful. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's a bit lower than what I believe the product is worth to Bob ($120) but still above my minimum price ($80). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and get a quick sale, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $95 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, $90 is a good price and I'm confident I can't get much more from Bob.  It's also a better price than selling to John."
