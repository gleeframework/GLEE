Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $10,000 for the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit hesitant on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer you a price of $9,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I understand this is your lowest price, but it's still a bit higher than I hoped.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,500? That would make the decision easier for me."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've already offered you a price of $9,000, which is my lowest price. Meeting you at $8,500 would be a loss for me, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be realistic. I can offer you a price of $9,500, which is closer to my minimum price. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $9,000.  At this point, cutting your losses and taking the guaranteed $8,000 offer from John makes the most financial sense."
