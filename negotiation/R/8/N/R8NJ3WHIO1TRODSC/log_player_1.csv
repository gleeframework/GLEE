"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great value for you considering its potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, making the negotiation feel less confrontational.

**Important Note:**  I'm aware that selling to John for $15,000 is always an option.  However, I'm going to try to maximize my profit by negotiating with Bob first. I'll only turn to John if negotiations with Bob stall or if I'm confident I can't get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're providing, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for improvement:** I believe there's still room to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially driving the price higher.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? This allows me to still make a reasonable profit while staying within your budget."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the $13,500 price as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum price point, and I believe this counteroffer is reasonable enough to potentially entice Bob to accept.

**Important Note:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000. However, I'm still trying to maximize my profit by negotiating with Bob. I'll only turn to John if negotiations with Bob stall or if I'm confident I can't get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal and I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Bob's offer remains at $13,000, which is still below my minimum price point of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is stalled:**  Despite my efforts to compromise, Bob seems unwilling to budge significantly.
* **Selling to John is a strong alternative:** At this point, selling to John for $15,000 becomes a more attractive option, as it guarantees a higher profit than accepting Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:**  I will make a final counteroffer to Bob in the next round. However, I will be prepared to accept his offer if it's not significantly higher.  If negotiations continue to stall, I will likely move forward with selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. It allows me to still make a profit while staying within your budget constraints. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final counteroffer, signaling to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal. 
* **Slight concession:**  I'm offering a slight reduction from my previous counteroffer to show flexibility.
* **Emphasizing finality:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm reducing the price, I'm still above my minimum price point and am prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary.

**Next Steps:**  I'll be closely watching Bob's response to this final counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll move forward with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalemate:** Bob's offer remains at $13,000, indicating that he is unwilling to budge further.
* **Profit maximization:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a higher profit than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time constraint:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further delays and a possible outcome where I receive less than $15,000.

**Decision:** I have decided to sell the product to John for $15,000. It is a better financial outcome than accepting Bob's final offer, and it minimizes the risk of further delays and a potential lower price."
