Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,100,000. There are still rounds left, so I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,125,000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and provides a fair return for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to pay $1125000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1130000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get even closer to my desired price,  $1,130,000 is a good deal considering the risk of Bob backing out or me needing to sell to John for $1,000,000. It's better to secure a solid profit than risk losing the deal entirely."
