{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate while still ensuring you get a good price.
* **It's significantly below your minimum:** This allows for some wiggle room in case Bob counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It directly states the offer and encourages a response.

Remember, the goal is to maximize profit while also considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing you to deal with John, who is offering your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly less than your ideal price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Negotiate further:** You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting immediately, you demonstrate that you're not desperate to sell and can potentially get a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. Consider a price between $900,000 and your previous offer of $1,200,000. This will show you're willing to compromise but still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,000,000?  That's still a good deal for you considering the product's value and it gives me some room to work with.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims for a middle ground:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows you're willing to compromise but still aiming for a higher price.
* **Lower than your previous offer:**  It demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to meet you halfway. 
* **Clear and concise message:** It reaffirms your desire to reach a deal while leaving room for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, you'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John. Your decision will depend on how determined you are to get a better price and how comfortable you are with the risk of potentially losing the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $900,000. While you could try to push for a higher price, there's a high risk that:

* **Bob might walk away:**  He's already rejected several offers and might not be willing to go higher.
* **You'll lose time:**  Further negotiations could drag on, potentially leading to a missed opportunity with John.

**Accepting Bob's offer:**

* **Minimizes risk:**  You're guaranteed a sale above your minimum, eliminating the risk of getting nothing from Bob.
* **Saves time:**  It allows you to move on to other opportunities quickly.
* **Offers a decent profit:** While not ideal, $950,000 is still a substantial sum.

**Next Steps:**

You can now finalize the deal with Bob and move on to other endeavors."
