Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price better reflects the value it will bring to my company, while also being a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,550,000? This would give us both a good deal and allow for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going and find a solution that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,475,000? This price seems more reasonable to me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can nudge him a little higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,475,000 is still a bit too far from where I need to be. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's compromise and settle on $1,525,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable deal for both parties.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1525000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,525,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,475,000, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's clear that Bob is not willing to budge on his price. I've made several counteroffers and tried to compromise, but he remains firm. I'm at risk of wasting more time in negotiations without reaching a satisfactory agreement. To avoid further delays and ensure I get the value I want, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
