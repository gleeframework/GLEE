"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $60 is quite low for the value this product offers.  Could you do $110? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a fair deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $110 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is simply too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $100.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair. If it doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'll need to explore other options.",100.0,Alice,5,
