Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""special price"", you create a sense of urgency and perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room:** While John offers a safe $120, aiming higher initially gives you a chance to potentially get even more from Bob. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping the option of John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $60 is far below your minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, his message indicates interest. There's room to negotiate towards a more reasonable price.
* **Backup Option:** You still have the option to sell to John for $120, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $60 is quite low for the value this product offers.  Could you do $110? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Drop:** Showing willingness to negotiate with a substantial price drop can encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The $110 offer keeps you well above your $80 minimum and leaves some space for further negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the price reduction and desire for a ""fair deal,"" you frame your counteroffer positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $110 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  $75 remains significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would still mean a considerable loss.
* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving slowly towards a more reasonable offer.  Continuing negotiations at this pace might not yield a satisfactory result.
* **Strong Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $120. This provides you with leverage and the ability to walk away from a bad deal with Bob. 

**It's time to signal to Bob that you're serious about your valuation of the product.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is simply too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $100.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair. If it doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you signal seriousness and limit further lowballing attempts.
* **Slight Concession:**  Coming down to $100 shows a degree of flexibility while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob of John's offer and the possibility of you walking away. 

This approach balances firmness with fairness, increasing the chances of either closing the deal at an acceptable price or moving on to a guaranteed sale."
