"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's clear she's starting the negotiation far above your price range.  You should definitely reject this offer and counter with a price much closer to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counteroffer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and doesn't immediately shut down the negotiation.
* **Signals budget:** By starting significantly lower, you signal that your budget is much lower than her asking price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  While $60 is your ideal starting point, offering this low leaves space for you to negotiate upwards towards your $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $60 is quite low for the value this product offers.  Could you do $110? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still too high for your $80 budget.  It's worth making another counteroffer to see if you can meet in the middle somewhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $110 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"", 
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Acknowledges progress:**  You're recognizing that Alice is negotiating and that her lower price is a step in the right direction. 
* **Firm but fair:** You're holding firm to your budget constraints, making it clear that $110 is still beyond your limit.
* **Strategic compromise:**  $75 is a strong counteroffer. It's a significant jump from your $60 offer but still keeps you below your $80 maximum. This demonstrates willingness to compromise while aiming for a price that works for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is simply too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $100.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair. If it doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is a strategic point to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Her language (""final offer"", ""firm offer"") suggests she won't go lower than $100.
* **You're close to your limit:**  While you could try another counteroffer, anything above $80 means overpaying compared to John's guaranteed price.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:** You know John will sell the product for $80, eliminating further negotiation risk. 

Sometimes, the best negotiation tactic is knowing when to walk away and take a good alternative deal."
