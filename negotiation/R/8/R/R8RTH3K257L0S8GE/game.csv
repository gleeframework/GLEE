"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. I'd be willing to meet you halfway if you're willing to negotiate further.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $16000? It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know your thoughts.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $16000 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $14000. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",14000.0,Bob,4,
