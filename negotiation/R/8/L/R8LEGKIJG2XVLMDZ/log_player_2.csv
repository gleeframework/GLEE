You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. It's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $8,125.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to take the sure thing and save the $125.  Further negotiation with Alice might not yield a better outcome."
