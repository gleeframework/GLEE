This offer is a starting point. I'm trying to get as close to my desired price of $10,000 as possible, while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."

While $7,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I consider fair.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price with another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
