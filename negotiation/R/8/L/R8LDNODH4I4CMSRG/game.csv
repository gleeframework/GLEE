"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which I think is fair considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still just a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? That seems like a fair price, and it gets us both closer to what we want.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92.50, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",92.5,Bob,6,
