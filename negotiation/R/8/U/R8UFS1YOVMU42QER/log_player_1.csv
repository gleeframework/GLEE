Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $97.50. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $97.50 is closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $97.50 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $102.50.  That's a fair compromise, and it still gives me a good price. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $102.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and pay $100.50. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm happy to accept Bob's offer of $100.50.  It's a bit more than what I'd get from John, and it means I don't have to risk losing the deal completely."
