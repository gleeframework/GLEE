"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is a special opportunity for you to acquire an item that is worth more than $10,000 to you, while also providing me with a satisfactory return for my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to go up to $10,500 at this time. This price still allows you to profit from the sale and is within my budget.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to accept $10,500 for the product. My minimum acceptable price remains at $11,500. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has refused to budge from her initial price. It's clear that further negotiation will not be successful. It's more beneficial to buy from John at $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
