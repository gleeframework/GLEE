"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's significantly higher than Alice's valuation of $800,000. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price by starting lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $900,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's offer ($900,000 vs. $1,200,000), we aim to bring the negotiation closer to Alice's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a price well below our $1,500,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, expressing continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This price would still give you a significant advantage, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving almost halfway towards your offer.  However, there's still a significant gap between her offer ($1,050,000) and her valuation ($800,000). Continuing to negotiate might yield a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's offer with a smaller increase ($975,000 from $900,000), signaling our willingness to compromise but also our firm stance on getting a good deal.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to the middle of the current negotiating range ($900,000 - $1,050,000). 
* **Maintaining Collaboration:** The message continues the positive and respectful tone, emphasizing fairness and a mutually beneficial outcome."
