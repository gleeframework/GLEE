"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This price would still give you a significant advantage, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
