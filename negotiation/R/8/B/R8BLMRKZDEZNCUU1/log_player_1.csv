"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see potential value in the product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I still have 9 rounds left and can always sell to John for $800,000 if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $900,000? This reflects the value I'm confident you'll see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $900000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $825000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $825,000 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000. I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
