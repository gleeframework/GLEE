"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see potential value in the product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $900000? This reflects the value I'm confident you'll see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $900000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $825000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
