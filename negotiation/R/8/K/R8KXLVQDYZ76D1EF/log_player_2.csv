"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $11,000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, he's still within his 10 rounds and can continue negotiating to get a better price.  Bob should keep trying to get closer to his $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still very interested in the product, but $13,500 is just outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's already close to his target price of $10,000.  He's within his 10 rounds and can still try to negotiate a better price. It's likely Alice is also nearing her bottom line, and with some persistence, Bob might be able to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping we can reach a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I'm not sure I can go higher. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price for both of us and I'd like to move forward with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky decision, but here's why accepting might be the best move:

* **Close to Target:** $12,000 is only $2,000 over Bob's target price of $10,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  This is round 9. If Bob rejects, there's only one round left, and he may not get a better deal. 
* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice has already made multiple concessions. It's unlikely she'll drop much further.
* **Risk of Jhon:**  Buying from John for $10,000 is tempting, but there's a risk that the product might be less desirable or John might not be as reliable.

While Bob would ideally get it for $10,000, accepting at $12,000 is a reasonable compromise considering the limited negotiation rounds and the potential risks of going to John."
