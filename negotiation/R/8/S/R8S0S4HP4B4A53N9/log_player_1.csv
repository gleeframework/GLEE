"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $150 to me. I'm hoping to get as much as possible, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering at $175. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this price will be appealing to Bob while still giving me a decent profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try for a better price by rejecting his offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $160. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping that this offer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can finally reach a deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, even though it's getting closer to my minimum. There are still rounds left, and I think I can get a better price. I'm willing to risk it and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}

I'm making a final push with a counteroffer of $155. It's only $5 more than John's offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and close the deal."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's clearly not willing to go any higher than $150, and I don't want to waste any more time.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, as it's my minimum acceptable price."
