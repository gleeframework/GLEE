Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1100000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your target of $800,000.  You have a solid alternative in John who's willing to sell for your target price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, hoping she'll come down closer to your target."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad to see you're serious about acquiring the product.
