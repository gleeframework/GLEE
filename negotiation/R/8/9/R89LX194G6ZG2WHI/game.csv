"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a significant amount of money, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $950000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in acquiring it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad to see you're serious about acquiring the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $950000. Considering the value it holds for me is $1500000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
