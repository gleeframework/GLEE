"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 is simply out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique benefits, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you.  To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is a competitive price considering the long-term potential of this product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant amount for me.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to achieve a successful deal. Let's make this happen.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
