"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1600000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
