"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1450000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still leaving a healthy profit margin for me.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000,  so it's not worth accepting. I will try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my desired value while remaining attractive to Bob."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,350,000.  I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to show some flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me in the middle. I'm confident that this price is still within the range that Bob is willing to pay, and it's significantly higher than the price I could get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still hoping to secure a higher price.  There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway with this offer.  It's a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than what I could get from John. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as we are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although it's not my ideal price, it's only $10,000 less than my last counteroffer, and we're running out of time.  It's better to secure the deal than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for a significantly lower price."
