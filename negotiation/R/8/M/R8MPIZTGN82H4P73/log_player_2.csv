"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our product to you. It is an exceptional opportunity that holds significant value for us at $1,500,000. We believe in creating win-win situations and are open to discussing terms that could be mutually beneficial. Let's work together to find a solution that respects the worth of our product while also aligning with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is better than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Alice's initial offer indicates she's willing to come down from her initial $1,500,000.  A counteroffer gives Bob a chance to try and get a better price."

I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for a fair profit margin for you. Let's work together to bridge the gap and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a counteroffer that respects both our interests. Given the value you place on the product, I am willing to consider $1,300,000 as a potential price point. This proposal aims to create a balance between the worth of our product and your budget constraints. I look forward to your feedback and hope we can move towards a satisfactory agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a significant improvement over her previous offer and brings the price closer to Bob's desired range.  It's still a good deal compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  There's a risk in continuing to negotiate that Alice might not come down further, and Bob could end up paying more.  Accepting the offer at this point ensures a good deal and avoids the potential for a higher price."
