"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm hoping we can find a price that's more aligned with my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for a fair profit margin for you. Let's work together to bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
