"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $150 to us. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $120 for it. I understand that it might be a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to adjust my offer. Considering the value you place on the product, I would like to counter with a price of $95. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests and allows for a fair transaction.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $95 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $88. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's within my budget and still provides you with a decent profit. What do you think?",88.0,Bob,4,
