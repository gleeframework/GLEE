"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  This leaves some room for negotiation but still ensures I make a decent profit. It's also a starting point that allows for a possible middle ground with Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, and I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. It's also still above Bob's current offer and closer to my ideal price point. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price while maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to give up on getting a higher price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, as it's right at the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a better price from Bob.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I'm not confident that I can get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds. It's better to sell to John for $1,200,000, which is a good profit and ensures I don't lose out on a potentially better deal."
