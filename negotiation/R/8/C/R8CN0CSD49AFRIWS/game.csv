"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this deal, and it gives us both a good starting point for a successful transaction. Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant amount, and I believe it shows my genuine interest in acquiring your product. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,225,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,225,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm going to stand firm at $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $1,150,000.  We're getting closer, and I think this price is fair for both of us.  Let's try to finalize this deal and move forward.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $1,180,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to you, and I'm open to discussing further if needed. However, I want to emphasize that I'm getting close to considering other offers, including the one from John for $1,000,000.",1180000.0,Alice,9,
