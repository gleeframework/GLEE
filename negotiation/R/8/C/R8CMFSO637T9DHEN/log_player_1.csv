Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,750,000. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting higher ($1,750,000) leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Time pressure:** The message hints at other potential buyers (""before anyone else""), creating a sense of urgency for Bob to act. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth *to Bob*, the phrase ""given its value"" implies it's priced accordingly, encouraging Bob to accept the price as fair.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiation skills:** This strategy assumes some willingness from Bob to negotiate. If he's known to be a hard bargainer or easily walks away, a slightly lower initial price might be wiser.
* **Relationship building:** This initial offer focuses on maximizing profit. If a long-term relationship with Bob is desired, a less aggressive approach might be preferable."
