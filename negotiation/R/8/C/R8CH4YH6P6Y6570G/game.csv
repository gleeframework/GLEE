"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is still too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $850000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it gives you a good return on your investment. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  However, $850000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1000000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a decent return on your investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still too far below my minimum requirement.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still committed to buying the product, but $950000 is still beyond my budget.  I can offer you $925000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm happy to see us getting closer, $925000 is still a bit too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $940000.  This allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's seal the deal.",940000.0,Alice,7,
