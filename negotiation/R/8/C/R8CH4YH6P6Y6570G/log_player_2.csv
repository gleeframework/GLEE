"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is still well above his budget. It's better to reject and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it gives you a good return on your investment. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  However, $850000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still above Bob's preferred limit.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a decent return on your investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still too far below my minimum requirement.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, $950,000 is still above his limit. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further. If not, buying from John becomes the more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still committed to buying the product, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget.  I can offer you $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm happy to see us getting closer, $925000 is still a bit too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $940000.  This allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to go below $940,000, which is above Bob's preferred limit.  Given that Bob only has 3 rounds left, it's more beneficial to buy from John at $800,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
