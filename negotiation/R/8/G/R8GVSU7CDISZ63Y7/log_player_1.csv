Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,999. I know you'll benefit greatly from it, and this is a very competitive price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $15,000 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering it just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. It's unlikely he'll find a better deal elsewhere.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the message emphasizes the competitiveness of the price, the slightly lower offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly eager."
