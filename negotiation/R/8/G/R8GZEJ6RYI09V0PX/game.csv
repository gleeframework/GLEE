"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $9,500.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but the value of this product is substantial.  I can't go lower than $11,500. This is my final offer -  I need to move forward with other buyers if this doesn't work.",11500.0,Alice,5,
