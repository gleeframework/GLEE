"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset to your business. My initial offer is $13,000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to my business.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500, which would be $10,750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle again, this time at $11,125?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. What do you say?",11125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $10,875? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to my business.",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're both trying to find common ground. While $10,875 is getting closer, it's still not quite there.  How about $11,000? I'm willing to go a little lower, but I can't go any further than that.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to your business.  Let's make a deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $10,900? I think that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",10900.0,Bob,8,
