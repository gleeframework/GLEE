"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a little high for me.  How about $105?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
