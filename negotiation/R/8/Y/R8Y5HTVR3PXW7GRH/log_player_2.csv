"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, it's still above your target of $150. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your commitment to finding a good deal. $100 is still within your budget, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my target price, it's still slightly above it.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice, hoping to get the price down further. I have rounds left, and Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise, suggesting there's potential for a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a little high for me.  How about $105?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step towards Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while staying within my desired price range.  The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect, appealing to Alice's desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
