"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious investment in it. I'd like to know if you're open to negotiating further.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a good offer, it's a bit below what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still allows me a reasonable profit while ensuring your investment is valuable.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
