# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This exceptional item holds immense value to me, and I believe it would be a perfect fit for your needs and aspirations. After careful consideration, I propose a purchase price of $1,300,000 for this product. I am confident that this offer strikes a balance between fair compensation for my investment and providing you with a significant benefit that aligns well with your valuation of $1,200,000. I look forward to discussing this further and exploring the possibility of a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the value Bob placed on the product, it's still above his maximum budget.  Since he has a guaranteed alternative with John for $1,200,000, rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to achieve his goal of getting the product within his budget."
