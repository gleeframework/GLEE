{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value to incentivize Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is a good offer, I'm not able to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my threshold of $8,000. I'm willing to take one more round of negotiation, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'll sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to come down to $8,200. This is my final offer, as it's getting very close to my minimum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7900 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000.  I've already negotiated for several rounds and I'm not convinced I can get a better offer from Bob.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $8,000, ensuring I get at least my minimum price."
