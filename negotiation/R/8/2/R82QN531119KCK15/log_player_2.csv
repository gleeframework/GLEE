"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum of $12,000, you know you have a backup option with John.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price."
