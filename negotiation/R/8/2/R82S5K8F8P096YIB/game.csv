"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than $12000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. Can you consider this price?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not sure I'm willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do better than $13000. How about $14500? I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'd rather not drag this out too long.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $13500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $13500. I'm still confident that the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a bit more movement from you. How about $14200? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13500 and $14500, but I need to see some more flexibility from you.",14200.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a bit more movement from you. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13800 and $14500. How about $14150? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to feel like we're getting close to a fair price.",14150.0,Alice,9,
