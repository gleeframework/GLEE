"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is the highest I can go, considering my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this deal work for me.  This price still offers you a good value, and it leaves some room for us to find common ground.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding of my budget constraints, but I'm afraid $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is the absolute maximum I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations.  However, $1,250,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to move forward.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  It's important to remember that this is a unique opportunity, and the product may not be available for long. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a final offer, and I'll meet you at $1,200,000. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for the same price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
