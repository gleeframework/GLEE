"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll experience. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that number is too low for me to accept, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than what I had in mind. Could we settle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
