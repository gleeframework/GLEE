"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product is only worth $10,000 to me at most.  How about we start the negotiations at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a significant discount for you, but I still need to make a profit. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe you'll find acceptable.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,000?  That's the maximum I'm willing to spend.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
