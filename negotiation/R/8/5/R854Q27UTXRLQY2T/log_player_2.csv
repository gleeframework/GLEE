Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product is only worth $10,000 to me at most.  How about we start the negotiations at $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a significant discount for you, but I still need to make a profit. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe you'll find acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is only $1,000 more than John's price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. Accepting now avoids the risk of her increasing her price or me missing out entirely."
