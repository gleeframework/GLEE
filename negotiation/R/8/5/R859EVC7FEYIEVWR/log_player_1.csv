Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $100 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a significant profit margin for you. It's close to Bob's maximum but still substantially more than your minimum.

**Why not higher?**

While you could start higher, there's a risk of alienating Bob. This offer strikes a balance between ambition and the potential for a quick, profitable deal."
