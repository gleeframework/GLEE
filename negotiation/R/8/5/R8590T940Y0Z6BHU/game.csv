"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of your product,  $500000 is significantly below what I can justify at this time.  I'm willing to pay  $1000000 for it, which reflects a strong interest in acquiring it while still staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to invest in our product. After careful consideration, I am pleased to counter your offer with a price of $750000. This price reflects the unique value and capabilities of our product, while still allowing us to cover our costs and ensure a fair return. I believe this offers a mutually beneficial solution that respects both our interests.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer of $1000000. Let's compromise and meet in the middle at $875000. This would still be a substantial profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
