"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $1,200,000 is a fair price, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my new offer is $1,225,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more and offer $1,275,000. This is a great price for both of us, and I think it's fair to both parties. Let's make this deal happen!",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $1,275,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,200,000, and I'll also throw in a one-time payment of $10,000 to sweeten the deal. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
