"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $22,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly.  We have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Price Reduction:** We need to bring Alice's expectations down significantly from her initial inflated offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $10,000 leaves us space to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $8,000 walk-away point and John's offer. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $18,000 is still significantly higher than both our target price and John's offer. 
* **Slow Progress:** Alice's counter-offer shows she's willing to negotiate, but the progress is too slow. We need to encourage larger price drops. 
* **Alternative Option:** We have the security of John's offer if the negotiation with Alice doesn't reach a favorable price soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could go up to $12,000 if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** Increasing our offer to $12,000 shows Alice we are willing to move, but we're keeping it well below her last offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help us gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to make a significant jump down, we can continue negotiating. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While we have time, we don't want this negotiation to drag on unnecessarily, especially since we have John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $12,000 is quite a way off from what I have in mind.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $15,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Price:** $15,500 is still considerably more than our $8,000 limit and John's offer. 
* **Slow Convergence:**  While Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, the pace is too slow. We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Time Pressure:** We're halfway through the rounds, and we need to start seeing significant movement from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still too high for me. To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for a much better price. I can offer you $13,000 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with the other option."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** It's crucial to make it clear that we have an alternative and are serious about walking away if the price doesn't meet our needs.
* **Final Offer:** Presenting this as our ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to make a decision.
* **Slight Increase:** We're increasing our offer slightly to show some flexibility, but we're still well below her last offer and our maximum budget.
* **Time Factor:** With only a few rounds left, we need to push for a resolution and avoid wasting time on endless back-and-forth."
