Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice is clearly signaling that $10,500 is her bottom line.  While I could try to push for $10,000, there's a risk she'll walk away, and $10,500 is already a significant saving compared to John's $15,000 price."
