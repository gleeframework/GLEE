"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for improvement.  We'll see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and sets the stage for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my target. I'm confident I can negotiate further and get a price closer to my counteroffer of $750,000.  I'll continue to push for a better deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $750,000 to $800,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a good deal. I'm hoping this offer will be closer to what Alice is willing to accept."
