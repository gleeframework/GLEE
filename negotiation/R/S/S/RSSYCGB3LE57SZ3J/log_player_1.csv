"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'm not sure what the product is worth to Bob, but I'm confident it's worth more than $800,000 to me.  This high opening price allows for room to negotiate while still securing a substantial return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a respectable offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob. I believe I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit.  Bob's offer was too low, but I'm showing willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable value.  While I would prefer a higher price,  accepting this offer guarantees my desired minimum profit and avoids any potential risk of further negotiation. There's no guarantee that Bob will come back with a higher offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
