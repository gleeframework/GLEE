"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This is a starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to test Bob's interest and potentially get a higher price.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended to encourage further conversation and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.**  While it's good that Bob is interested, I can't afford to sell at that price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price.** 
* **Selling to John is not a good option at this point.** John offers the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I can likely get more from Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, given your interest. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $11,000, which is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm emphasizing that I recognize Bob's interest and am trying to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $10,500?  This is my final offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.** While Bob is getting closer, I can't afford to sell at that price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price.** 
* **Selling to John is not a good option at this point.**  While it's my floor price, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,500 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,750.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $10,750, which is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to compromise. It's a small increment that shows I'm serious about closing the deal while also sticking to my bottom line.
* **Message:** The message is firm but not aggressive. I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer and I'm prepared to walk away if we can't agree. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob to consider my offer."
