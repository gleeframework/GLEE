Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9500 is simply too low. It's not even close to what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $11000. How about we split the difference at $10250? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.
