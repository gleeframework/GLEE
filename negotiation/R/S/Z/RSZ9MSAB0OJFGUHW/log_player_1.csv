"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a significant mark-up from my minimum value of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gives Bob a good deal considering the product is worth $10,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to settle for that low of a price yet.  I believe I can get closer to my desired amount through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still keeping the price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting close to my minimum, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
