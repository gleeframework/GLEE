"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  Offering $10,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a lower price. Bob can continue to counter-offer and try to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer in this round takes a more measured approach.  Instead of making another large drop, he's proposing a smaller decrease that demonstrates his seriousness while still leaving some room for potential compromise.  This approach shows a willingness to meet in the middle without completely surrendering his position."
