While closer to my budget, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer again to see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice is holding firm and $11,000 is a reasonable price.  It's a good saving compared to John's offer."
