"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $115 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",120.0,Alice,5,
