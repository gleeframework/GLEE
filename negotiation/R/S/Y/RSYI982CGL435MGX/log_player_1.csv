"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to build rapport with Bob by highlighting the product's value and framing the price as a ""great deal"".
* **Open-ended question:**  This encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $110 is a tempting price, it's below my minimum threshold of $120. I'm not willing to sell at a loss. 
* **Proceeding to next round:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is a good offer, it's a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's still a great deal for you, and it works for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Positive message:** I'm reaffirming my interest in selling to Bob and highlighting the value he's getting for his money.
* **Clear and concise:** I'm making a specific counteroffer with a clear explanation to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $115. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $112.50. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $112.50 is getting closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below my target price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.
* **Proceeding to next round:**  I'm willing to continue the negotiation, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal.  However, $112.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $113.50, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 113.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm again making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum threshold. 
* **Final offer:** I'm putting the pressure on Bob by declaring it my final offer. This could encourage him to accept rather than risk losing the deal. 
* **Fair price:** I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is fair to both of us. 
* **Direct question:** I'm giving Bob a clear opportunity to respond and move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $113.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and pay $113.00. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $113
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer of $113 is very close to my minimum threshold of $120 and the negotiation has reached a point where it is likely that Bob will not increase his offer further. Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  While $113 is not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit.  Staying in the negotiation might lead to a lower price or the negotiation might break down completely, forcing me to sell to John at $120. It's better to accept a slightly lower price than risk losing the sale altogether."
