Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth rejecting and trying to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $140

Alice's offer of $140 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer to my limit.  I'm going to accept this offer since it's better than going with John, and it's still a decent deal for me."
