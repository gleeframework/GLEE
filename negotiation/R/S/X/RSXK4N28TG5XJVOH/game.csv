"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's value. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me there?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $85 just isn't enough for me to move forward.  Let's split the difference - how about $90?  This way, we both get a fair price.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Can you meet me there?",87.5,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $89?  This is just a small step up from your last offer, but it's the best I can do at this point.",89.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $89 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $87. I really think that's the best I can do. Can you meet me there?",87.0,Bob,8,
