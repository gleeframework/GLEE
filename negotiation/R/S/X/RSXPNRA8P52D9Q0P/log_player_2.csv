"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration of its value, we believe it is worth $2000000. We understand that the true value might be subjective, but based on our research and market analysis, this is a fair price. Let's discuss how we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $2,000,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
