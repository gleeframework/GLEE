"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,700,000.  It's a fair price considering its potential, and it's the maximum I can afford.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

It's a fair price considering the product's potential, and it's the absolute maximum I can manage.  Let's close this deal!",1700000.0,Bob,6,
