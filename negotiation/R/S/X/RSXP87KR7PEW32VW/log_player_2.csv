While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still over your budget. Rejecting and counteroffering again is a better strategy to try and get a price closer to your target."

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, it's still a bit above your ideal price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can land a deal at $1,700,000.  If she rejects again, you can always buy from John."
