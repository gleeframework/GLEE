"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd really find it valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```
Reasoning:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Gauging Interest:** The initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he immediately accepts, you might have gone too low. If he counters much lower, you know he's far off from your valuation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have John as a backup who will buy the product for $100. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $90 is still above his perceived value of $80, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Closer to Your Minimum:** While $90 is less than your ideal price, it's getting closer to your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows you're willing to walk away if necessary, which can push him to increase his offer in the next round.  You'll use the next round to try and get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $105?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer of $90 and your initial asking price of $120. This shows a willingness to negotiate but holds firm to a price above your minimum.
* **Above Minimum, Targeting Profit:** By aiming for $105, you're seeking a price that's both above your minimum and provides a reasonable profit margin.
* **Time Consideration:** There are still several rounds left, so there's room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $97.50 is above your absolute minimum of $100, securing you a profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield very small increases, and there's a risk that Bob will walk away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further rounds and allows you to move on."
