Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he might get a ""deal.""
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" Alice subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone remains collaborative and open for discussion, making Bob more likely to counter-offer instead of outright rejecting the initial price. 

**Important Note:**  While Alice has a guaranteed sale with John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a significantly better outcome."
