"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so it's likely worth even less to me. I can get it for $15,000 from John, so I'll reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
