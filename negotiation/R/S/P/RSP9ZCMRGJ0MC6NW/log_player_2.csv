"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to give in at $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the lowest price I can accept. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not budging from the $12,000 price point. It's unlikely she'll go any lower in the last round. At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $15,000 is the best option, even though it's not ideal."
