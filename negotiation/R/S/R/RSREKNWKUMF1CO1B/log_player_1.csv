{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that while Bob values the product at $15,000, he may not be willing to pay the full amount.  By starting at $14,000, we leave space for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is more than my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a reasonable compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold and within my acceptable range. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John at a lower price."
