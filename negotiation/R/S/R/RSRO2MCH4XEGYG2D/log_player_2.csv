**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, while John wants $1,500,000. 
* **You can still make a profit:** Even at $1,200,000, you are still getting the product for less than your maximum value of $1,500,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision to save money."
