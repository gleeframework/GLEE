"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a great opportunity for your business, and I believe you'll find it extremely valuable.  My starting price is $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that leaves me significantly below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this time. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I need to ensure I receive a fair price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1600000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. Would you be willing to meet me at $1400000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price,  $1,400,000 is still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to acquire this product, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, $1,400,000 still doesn't meet my minimum requirement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, reflecting the value I see in this product and the potential it holds for you. Let's finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1550000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. Would you be willing to meet me at $1450000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price, it makes more sense to sell to John now and avoid further negotiation with Bob.  The potential for a longer negotiation with Bob is not worth the risk of getting a lower price."
