"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget and I'm not sure if I can stretch to $130. Can we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from it.  Let's meet in the middle.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can we meet at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
