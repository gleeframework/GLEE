"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I think this is a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $800000 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a budget, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still believe that $800000 is the most I can afford for this product. I would like to stick to that figure if possible. Could we find a middle ground?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable accepting that price. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1000000. This is as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
