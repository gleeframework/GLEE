"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  However,  I'm mindful of the 10 round limit and the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent profit, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still represents a significant profit. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to close the deal, as I want to avoid going back and forth too many times."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is still a profit, it's getting closer to John's offer. I'm going to try to get a little more from Bob. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, but if he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. $1,250,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping it's enough to convince him to buy. If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. It's time to take the deal and secure the profit."
