"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but one that still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway, considering the product is worth $8,000 to him. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for more. I believe there's room for compromise.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can get closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is only a $500 increase from Bob's last offer, and it shows I'm getting closer to making a deal. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are at a critical point. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired value, I've already gone through several rounds and the negotiation isn't moving fast enough.  The risk of further negotiation and reaching a stalemate is high.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees I achieve my minimum value and avoid further risk."
