"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm very interested in the product but can't go above $1,200,000.  This is my best offer. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is considerably below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a significant compromise on my end.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my original offer of $1,200,000. This is the highest I can go. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your budget, but I also need to be fair to myself.  How about this: I'll come down to $1,600,000, but only if we can close the deal today. This offer is off the table if we don't reach an agreement this round.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to close quickly, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
