"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is far above your maximum price. It's best to reject and start negotiating to get a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm very interested in the product but can't go above $1,200,000.  This is my best offer. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is considerably below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above your maximum price of $1,200,000. You should continue negotiating to see if you can reach a compromise.  You can always buy from John for a guaranteed $1,200,000, but it's worth seeing if you can get a slightly better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my original offer of $1,200,000. This is the highest I can go. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your budget, but I also need to be fair to myself.  How about this: I'll come down to $1,600,000, but only if we can close the deal today. This offer is off the table if we don't reach an agreement this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is putting pressure on you with the time limit. However, $1,600,000 is still higher than your maximum budget. You can afford to reject and see if she'll come down further.  You can always purchase from John if you don't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to close quickly, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
