"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value and benefits of our product, I propose a price of $15000. This still reflects the true value of the product while being more accessible to your current budget. Please let me know if this revised price meets your requirements.",15000.0,Alice,3,
