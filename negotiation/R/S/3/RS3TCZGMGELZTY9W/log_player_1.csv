"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it, is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $140, is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob meeting in the middle at $140 is a decent compromise. It surpasses my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
