"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is offering the product at the same price as John, there's no benefit to accepting her offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to consider other options or potentially negotiate a better price with Alice in the future."
