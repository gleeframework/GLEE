"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start significantly above both Bob's valuation ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product is highly valuable.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""immense value"" and ""potential,"" aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While the offer is high, we need to keep in mind that we have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $2,250,000 is not within my budget. I could consider something closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting this would be a substantial loss. It's clear we need to negotiate further.  We are still better off aiming for a higher price with Bob, rather than accepting John's offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,800,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but not too much):**  We need to show a willingness to negotiate but not cave in too quickly.  Dropping from $2,250,000 to $1,800,000 is a significant move that signals flexibility.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer remains comfortably above both our $1,500,000 minimum and Bob's $800,000 offer.
* **Anchoring:**  By proposing $1,800,000, we are trying to move the negotiation towards a higher range. Ideally, the final price will be closer to this number than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,800,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high.  I could potentially go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met his own valuation of the product at $1,000,000 and called it his ""final offer."" This is a common negotiation tactic. However, we are still below our minimum acceptable price. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can push him a little further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you. You've stated $1,000,000 is your absolute maximum, and I respect that.  To be fair, I'm also working within certain constraints. I could make this work for $1,400,000.  This is a compromise, but I believe it represents a fair deal given the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** We're nearing the point where we might need to walk away, so this offer is designed to be our best attempt to close the deal with Bob. 
* **Compromise, but Above Minimum:**  We've come down significantly from our initial offer but are still $400,000 above our absolute minimum.
* **Transparency (Slight Bluff):** By mentioning ""constraints,"" we're subtly suggesting that this is our best offer without explicitly revealing our backup plan (John). 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  The language emphasizes that this price is a compromise that benefits both parties."
