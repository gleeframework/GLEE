Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $2,250,000 is not within my budget. I could consider something closer to $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,800,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your initial offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you. You've stated $1,000,000 is your absolute maximum, and I respect that.  To be fair, I'm also working within certain constraints. I could make this work for $1,400,000.  This is a compromise, but I believe it represents a fair deal given the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice is not budging enough and you've hit your maximum price. It's time to walk away and take the guaranteed deal with John."
