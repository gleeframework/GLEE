"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
