"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you as well. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a reasonable price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it would bring to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This product is truly worth that much to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable for your business.  Let's close this deal at this fair price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
