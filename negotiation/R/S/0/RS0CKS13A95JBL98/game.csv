"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  While $8,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good price.  While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $8,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
