Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob, increasing the chances of acceptance.
* **Prepared for Counteroffers:**  I'm aware that Bob might counteroffer, and I'm ready to negotiate further.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. If Bob doesn't accept my offer, I can always walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's closer to my floor price, I can likely do better by continuing to negotiate.
* **I have a stronger bargaining position.** I know John is willing to pay $15,000, so I have a safety net and can afford to be firm with Bob.
* **I'm aiming for a higher price.** I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm but Reasonable Price:**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer but still maintained a margin. $10,500 is a solid compromise.
* **Emphasize the Value:**  I reiterate that this is a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:**  My message conveys a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price, encouraging Bob to continue the discussion.

**Key Points:**

* I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* I'm not accepting Bob's offer but showing flexibility to avoid a breakdown in negotiations. 
* My offer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial counter, leaving room for potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Floor Price:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might risk losing the deal entirely. He has already indicated $9,500 is his maximum.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale.

**Conclusion:**  It's better to accept Bob's offer and make a profit than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with no sale."
