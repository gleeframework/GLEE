"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. That being said, $900,000 is still a little rich for me. How about we meet in the middle again, say around $750,000? That would be a fair deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the value the product brings to your business, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. It seems like we're getting close.  How about we split the difference and call it $825,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,6,
