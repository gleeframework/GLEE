Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target.

This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

Alice is not budging much and we're running out of rounds. It's unlikely she'll go below $850,000.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $800,000."
