"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $95. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $90. How about $92? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still looking to make a profit, and $92 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about $97? It's a fair price that still gives us both a good deal.",97.0,Alice,5,
