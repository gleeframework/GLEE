"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $108?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet in the middle at $109. That's just a dollar more than your offer, and it's a good price for both of us.  What do you say?",109.0,Alice,5,
