Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is your maximum offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we try $912,500?

```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly lowering her price, it's clear she's unlikely to reach our target of $900,000, let alone go lower. We've been firm with our maximum offer, and continuing negotiations risks running out of rounds. At this point, the potential savings from haggling with Alice are outweighed by the guaranteed savings of buying from John at $800,000."
