"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $100 for you. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. It's worth seeing if Alice will negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $85. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let me think about it and come back to you with a better proposal. In the meantime, I would like to remind you that the product has a significant value to you, and we're trying to find a fair price for both parties. Could we meet somewhere in between, say at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $90 is closer to his desired range, it's still higher than his initial counteroffer.  There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting and making a new counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While I understand the value you're placing on the product,  $88 is the absolute highest I'm willing to go.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your response. Considering the value of the product to you and my position, I believe we could reach an agreement at $92. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get a lower price. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $92 is still a bit high.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best option to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $89 is my final offer. If you're willing to take that, I'm ready to buy. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I am prepared to offer the product at $91. This allows us to maintain a fair transaction while respecting the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $91 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $89. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and time-consuming.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, saves time, and avoids the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal."
