"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. The product is worth significantly more to me than his offer. I will counter in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a great deal."",

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your target. How about we try $825,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is clearly trying to get a good deal, but his latest offer of $825,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's significantly more than my fallback option with John, so it makes sense to accept and close the deal now."
