"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This offer reflects the product's true value while still acknowledging your budget concerns.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find a price we can both agree on, I can't go as low as $9,500.  Would you consider $10,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",10750.0,Alice,5,
