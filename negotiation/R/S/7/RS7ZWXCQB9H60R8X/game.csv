"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more like $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. Can you consider my new counteroffer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
