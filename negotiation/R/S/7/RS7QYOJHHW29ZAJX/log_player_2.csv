Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $78, which would be $81.50. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $80. Buying from John for $80 is the best option to ensure you get the product within your budget.  There's no point in further negotiation with Alice."
