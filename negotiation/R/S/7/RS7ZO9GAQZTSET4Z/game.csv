"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I am hoping to keep the price closer to my maximum budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum price. I'm proposing $850,000.  This still allows you significant value, and it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm aiming to keep the cost within my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $800,000. I hope this proposal works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
