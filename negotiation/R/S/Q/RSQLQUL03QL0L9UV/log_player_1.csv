Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, we want to secure the highest possible price. Starting with an offer closer to his valuation increases the chances of a quick and profitable sale. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:**  Offering $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value while avoiding an overly aggressive initial offer that might alienate Bob."
