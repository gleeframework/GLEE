# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, making it a better deal for you."
