Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's her guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering it at $119 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slightly better deal if he's inclined to haggle. 
* **Avoid Going Too Low:**  Dropping the price significantly below $119 risks losing potential profit, especially since Bob's perceived value is only $100."
