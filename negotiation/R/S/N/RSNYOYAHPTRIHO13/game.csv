"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to make a special offer just for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is intriguing, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
