# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?

```"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's initial offer was wildly inflated. I need to counter with something reasonable, but leaves room for negotiation.  

```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to a realistic price. Would you consider $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $18,000 might have been on the high side, $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we try $10,000? I think that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $10,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept.  I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  To be fair to you, I'm willing to come down to $12,500, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough one. Alice is playing hardball, and $12,500 is getting close to my limit. However, I think there's still a small chance I can get it lower, and I'm willing to risk one more round.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
