"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to a realistic price. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $18,000 might have been on the high side, $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we try $10,000? I think that's a fair offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $10,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept.  I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  To be fair to you, I'm willing to come down to $12,500, but this is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $11,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.",11000.0,Bob,6,
