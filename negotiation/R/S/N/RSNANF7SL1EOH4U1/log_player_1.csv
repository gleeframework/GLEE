Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I think you'll find it to be of excellent value at $15,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he counters.
* **Creating Value:** The message emphasizes that Bob is getting a special opportunity and hints that the product might be offered more widely later at a potentially higher price. 
* **Leaving Room:** While we start at $15,000, the message is open-ended, allowing Bob to counter with a lower offer.  We can then negotiate down towards our minimum of $12,000.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still ensuring the sale of the product."
