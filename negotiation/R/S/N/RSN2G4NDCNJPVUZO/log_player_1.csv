Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep at $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1,500,000. This is the highest I can go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is now offering a price equal to my guaranteed sale with John. Accepting ensures a quick and favorable deal without risking further negotiation."
