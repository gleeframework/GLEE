"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $14000. Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $14000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17500.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground here!",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
