"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140? That's still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $130? That's the lowest I can go, but I really want to make a deal with you.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $130 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That's a fair price, and I'm hoping you'll agree.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $125. If you can meet me at that price, I'll make the deal. That's the lowest I can go.",125.0,Bob,6,
