"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, it's great to connect with you about this.  I'm offering the product to you at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than my minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""potential value to your business,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Alternative:** While I have John as a backup, it's early in the negotiation. It's worth seeing if Bob is willing to pay a premium before settling for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is a significant jump down. While $1,000,000 is still a profit, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter to see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand your perspective on the price, but I can't go as low as $1,000,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?"",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting $1,175,000, I'm aiming for a compromise. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still holding a strong position. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I haven't drastically lowered my price from the initial offer. This reinforces that the product has significant value. 
* **Urgency:** I'm not mentioning John at this point, as it might make me seem desperate.  However, as rounds progress, I'll consider bringing him up to add a time pressure element to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we agree on $1,075,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating more slowly, but he's still moving. I'm not willing to accept his current offer, as it's a relatively small concession. I'll counter with a price that keeps the negotiation moving but also signals that I'm nearing my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,075,000 is pushing my bottom line. Would you consider $1,125,000? This is a significant investment for me, and I need to ensure it makes sense from my end as well."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm only reducing my price by $50,000 this round. This signals that I'm getting close to my lowest acceptable price.
* **Justification:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a significant deal for me too, adding a layer of ""fairness"" to the negotiation and implying I'm not just trying to maximize profit at his expense.
* **No Mention of John:** I'm keeping John as a backup option for now. I want to see if I can secure a deal closer to my desired price before introducing that time pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is a significant investment for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? That's a firm offer from my side. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,100,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum of $800,000.
* **""Firm Offer"":**  Bob's language suggests he's unlikely to move much higher.  
* **Time Investment:**  Continuing to negotiate for potentially small gains isn't worth risking the deal entirely. It's better to secure a good offer now."
