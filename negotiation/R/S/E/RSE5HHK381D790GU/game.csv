"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the midpoint of our values.  How about we split the difference and I pay $1,050,000?  I believe this is still a good deal for you as it's well above your value for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm now offering the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference again and I'll offer $987,500. This is a fair compromise that allows you to get a good price for the product while still saving me a significant amount.  What do you think?",987500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $987,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll only go down to $990,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",990000.0,Alice,5,
