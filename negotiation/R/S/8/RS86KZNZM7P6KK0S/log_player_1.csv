Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me. To be honest, anything over $800,000 is a tough sell. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? It's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're trying to find a middle ground, so I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit.  How about $750,000? That's the best I can do.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum requirement of $1,000,000.  I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
