Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offering price:**  $1,150,000 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** It's important to be friendly and emphasize the value of the product while also conveying a sense of fairness.

**Strategy:**

This starting price allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I consider selling to John.  I'm aiming for a win-win, but I'll be prepared to counter Bob's offers and even walk away if the price doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is far too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a good price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my absolute minimum to encourage continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great price considering the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $1,050,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer but still well above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining a respectable profit.
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal while also reiterating the value of the product.  The message focuses on finding a mutually beneficial compromise.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to consider a price closer to my desired range. It's a calculated risk, as Bob could reject this offer again.  However, I'm prepared to make further adjustments if necessary.  My goal is to reach a deal without selling to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal considering:

* **Potential for further negotiation:** I could continue negotiating, but there's no guarantee I'll get a significantly higher offer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with selling to John for a lower price.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's just above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation or a lower sale price with John. It's a practical decision that prioritizes a guaranteed sale at a reasonable price."
