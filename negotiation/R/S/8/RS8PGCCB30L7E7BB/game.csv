"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective, I need to be closer to $11000 to make this work for me.  This product is truly unique and offers significant value, and I think $11000 is a fair reflection of that. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a little too low for me. The value of this product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident that $12000 would be a fair price for both of us.  This would give you a great deal, and it would allow me to get a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, which is my absolute maximum. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000",10500.0,Bob,6,
