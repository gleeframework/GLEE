"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to drop the price to $13,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
