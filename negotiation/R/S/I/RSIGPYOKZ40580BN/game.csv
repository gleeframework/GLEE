"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still within my budget and represents a significant gain for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short on my desired profit margin. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
