"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair and reasonable starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000, so it's worth negotiating further. There's room for both parties to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still within my budget and represents a significant gain for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short on my desired profit margin. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and brings the price closer to Bob's desired range. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a much higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal for Bob while still leaving room for him to potentially make a profit."
