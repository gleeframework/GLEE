"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $6,500.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
