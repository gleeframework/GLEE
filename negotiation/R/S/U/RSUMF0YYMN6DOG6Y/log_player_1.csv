"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still maximizing potential profit.  I'm confident in the value of my product and want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could accept and walk away with something, it's significantly less than my minimum target.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but a considerable drop from my initial price. I'm hoping to find a compromise that's closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price. There are still several rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $10,000. This is a smaller decrease than before, showing I'm serious about making a deal. It's also a good middle ground between our current offers, hopefully pushing Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still determined to get closer to my ideal price. I've already lowered my offer significantly and Bob has only increased his by a small amount. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to make a small counteroffer of $9,750. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob doesn't accept. We're very close to a deal, and I'm hoping this small gesture will push Bob to accept."
