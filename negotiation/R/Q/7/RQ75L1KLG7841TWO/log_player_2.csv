"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500 for it. This offer takes into account both the high value you see in the product and my goal to maximize the return on this valuable item. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $10,000.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer if you reject her initial proposal.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so it's worth seeing if she'll come down further."
