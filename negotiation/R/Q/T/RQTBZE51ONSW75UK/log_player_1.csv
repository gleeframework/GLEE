Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to bargain and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Anchoring:**  By offering $120, I'm setting a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be closer to my asking price than if I started low. 
* **Knowing Your Worth:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $80, aiming higher allows me to potentially maximize my profit.

It's important to remember that this is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
