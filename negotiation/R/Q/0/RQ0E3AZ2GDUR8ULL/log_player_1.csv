Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" might make him reconsider. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency and reminds Bob that I have a strong fallback option.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation skills, I (Alice) might adjust the price slightly during the negotiation process."
