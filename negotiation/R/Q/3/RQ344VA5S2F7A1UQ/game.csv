"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's unique advantages, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
