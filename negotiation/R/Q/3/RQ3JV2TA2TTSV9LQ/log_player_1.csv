"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm going to start by asking for my full value. While I'm willing to negotiate, I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and what his initial stance is.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter-proposal and how many rounds are left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up in his next offer.  We have many rounds left, and there's still a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a significant profit for me and allows for some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value. While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. We still have a lot of rounds left, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm still within a range where I can make a decent profit. I hope Bob sees this as a sign of good faith and is willing to meet me in the middle. We're nearing the middle rounds, and I want to make sure we can come to an agreement before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value. We've been through a few rounds of negotiations, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to pay my desired price.  With only a few rounds left, the risk of not closing the deal is too high.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This will guarantee a sale and ensure I get the best possible outcome."
