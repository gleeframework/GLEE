Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and I have a guaranteed sale for that price with John, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $1,500,000 offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might try to haggle, but I have the security of John's offer if Bob rejects it.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
