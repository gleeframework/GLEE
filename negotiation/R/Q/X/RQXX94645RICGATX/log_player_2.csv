"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  He's willing to pay up to $120, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to sell for $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  I'm sure we can find a price that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal.  It's only $5 more than Bob's counteroffer, and continuing to negotiate may not result in a significantly better price. It's a better deal than buying from John for $120."
