I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. What do you think?,9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $8500? It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but $7000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8250? It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $8250. I'm still thinking $7000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make a small concession, so how about we meet at $7500? It's still a bit lower than your last offer, but I think it's a good compromise.",7500.0,Bob,6,
