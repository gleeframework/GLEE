"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than Alice's initial value of $120, it's still above Bob's maximum of $80.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget. How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his maximum of $80.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price. It's possible Alice is willing to go lower, and Bob has several rounds left to get there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit over my budget at $100.  Would you consider $95?  That's the absolute most I can do, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
