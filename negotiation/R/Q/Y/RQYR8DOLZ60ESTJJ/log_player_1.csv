"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price that's more reasonable for both of us in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget. How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price for this great product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit over my budget at $100.  Would you consider $95?  That's the absolute most I can do, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to $100, I recognize that Bob is really pushing the limit of his budget.  $95 is a fair compromise and secures the sale.  I'd rather get $95 than risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for $120."
