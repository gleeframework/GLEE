"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a fair starting point, as the product is worth $100 to Bob, and I need to make a profit. I'm hoping to close the deal quickly, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to make a bit more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a compromise that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $110 is a good price, and we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's not worth risking losing the sale to John."
