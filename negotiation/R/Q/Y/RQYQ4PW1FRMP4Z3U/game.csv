"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78?",78.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $78 isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $81?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this price.",81.0,Alice,5,
