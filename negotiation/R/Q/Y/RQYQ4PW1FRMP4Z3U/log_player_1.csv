Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer because it is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer again. While it is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $80. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $78 isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $81?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 81}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $81 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $79? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $79 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob in the next round, I'm worried we might not reach a deal before the 10 rounds are up.  To avoid losing out, I'm going to sell the product to John for $80."
