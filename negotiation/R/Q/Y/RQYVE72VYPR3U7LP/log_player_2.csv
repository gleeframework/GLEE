# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could consider a price closer to $700,000."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer you the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm eager to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $850,000, and you can get the product for $800,000 from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
