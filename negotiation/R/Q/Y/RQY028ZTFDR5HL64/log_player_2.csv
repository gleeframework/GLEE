"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a significant opportunity for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. This price gives us both a good deal. If you're not interested, I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
