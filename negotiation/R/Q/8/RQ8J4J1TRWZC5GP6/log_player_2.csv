Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,050,000, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. While there's a chance we could negotiate further, it's not worth the risk. I can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal for me."
