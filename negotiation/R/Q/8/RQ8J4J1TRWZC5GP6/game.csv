"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,050,000, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
