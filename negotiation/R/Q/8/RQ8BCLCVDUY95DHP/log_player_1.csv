Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
