"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $120 from John if you reject Alice's offer.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer, allowing you to save even more money."
