"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round.  $100 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price, and I have a fallback option with John if the deal doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to try to get closer to my desired price. However, I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed $150 sale with John, which is a strong safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit more to try and reach a deal with Bob. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price and hoping to close the deal before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is closer to my ideal price than Bob's previous offers, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  I'm keeping my eyes on John's offer of $150 as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

I'm making a final attempt to close the deal with Bob.  $130 is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still fair considering my minimum acceptable price and the value of the product to Bob.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to John for a guaranteed sale at my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the time is running out.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired price.  I've already made significant compromises to reach a deal with Bob, and it seems unlikely he'll meet my price.  It's time to secure a guaranteed sale with John at $150."
