"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you can likely get a better price.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate and Alice's offer is close to your upper limit.  It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing you are serious about negotiating.  It's also above Alice's value of $80, giving her some room to make a profit. This sets a fair starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $95 is still too high.  You are willing to pay up to $120, but you want to save as much as possible.  Continuing to negotiate has the potential to get you a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer reiterates your previous offer of $85, showing you are firm in your desire to get a lower price. It also acknowledges Alice's compromise, showing respect while maintaining your negotiation position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. How about $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $92.50 is still a bit high. You are willing to pay up to $120, but you want to save as much as possible. There's still room for negotiation, and you have a few more rounds to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still aiming for $85, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you are willing to compromise but are still trying to get a better deal. You are meeting Alice halfway by offering $90, which is closer to her offer of $92.50 but still below your initial counteroffer of $85. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price you're comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're still looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about $92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $92 is still more than you are willing to pay right now. You have a few more rounds to negotiate, and with a little more pressure, you might be able to get her down to your price of $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer reiterates your previous offer of $90, showing that you are committed to getting that price. You also acknowledge Alice's need to make a profit, showing that you are negotiating in good faith.  You're hoping that with only a few rounds left, she'll accept and make the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can sell it to you for $91. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
