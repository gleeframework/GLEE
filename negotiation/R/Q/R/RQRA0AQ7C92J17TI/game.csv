"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to find a mutually beneficial price.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is intriguing, but it's a bit lower than I'd hoped. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to pay $700,000. This represents a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer you the product for $650,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $650,000 is closer to where I want to be, I still believe $680,000 is a more reasonable price considering the value of this product. Let's try to find common ground. This offer is a compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",680000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $660,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $650,000 and $680,000, so I'll offer you the product for $665,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",665000.0,Alice,5,
