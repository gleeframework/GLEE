"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. I could go up to $720,000.  Let me know what you think.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
