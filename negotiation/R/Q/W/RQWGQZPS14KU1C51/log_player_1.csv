Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. Please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers the safety net of $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better outcome.
* **Understanding Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't pay more. There might be strategic reasons for him to acquire it.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above Bob's perceived value. It also keeps the price attractive compared to your guaranteed offer from John.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to decide quickly."
