"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11000, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. Bob can save $4,000 compared to buying from John, and it's still a reasonable price considering Alice's minimum price is $8,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
