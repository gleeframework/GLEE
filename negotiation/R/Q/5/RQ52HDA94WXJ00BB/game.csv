"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and should make this deal very attractive to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This would be a great price for you, and it would allow me to achieve a fair value for my product. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
