"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad to hear you're willing to make a serious commitment. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $9500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to make another counteroffer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10000.

This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $12000. I'd like to make one final offer of $9500, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",9500.0,Bob,6,
