"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my research, I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the value I know it holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's exceptional quality and rarity.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still out of my range. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $700000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the product's true worth. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still looking to negotiate, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1000000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer of $1000000, and I see we're getting close. However, my maximum budget is $800000. If you're serious about selling, I'm willing to offer that amount for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it reflects a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know your decision.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where I need to consider other options. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from your end. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other opportunities.",900000.0,Alice,7,
