Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm asking for $20,000. It's a unique item, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Highlighting value, not just price:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, I want to emphasize the product's worth and why it's a good investment for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I'm aiming high, the message is phrased to show I'm open to discussing the price further. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough that Bob might accept it outright."
