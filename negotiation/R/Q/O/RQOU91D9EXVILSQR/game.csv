"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to your target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $13,500 is still a little more than I had in mind. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
