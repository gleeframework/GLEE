Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to your target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $12,500.  Since John offers the product for $12,000, it makes more sense to buy from John and save the extra $500."
