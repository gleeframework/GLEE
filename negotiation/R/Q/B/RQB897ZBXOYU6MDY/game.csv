"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $950,000 is tempting, I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
