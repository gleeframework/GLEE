Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a high starting point, but I believe it's important to set the bar high initially.  I'm hoping that Bob values the product more than $800,000 and is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $920,000 is a solid deal and significantly better than the $800,000 I would receive from John. It's clear Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, and I don't want to risk losing that value by continuing to negotiate."
