"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $1,100,000 is too low, I'm willing to move down to $1,325,000. This reflects the significant value the product brings, especially for a business like yours.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,325,000 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
