Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it's important to set a high baseline and see if Bob is genuinely interested.  If he's not, I can always lower the price gradually until we find a mutually agreeable point. It's better to start high and negotiate down than to start low and have to fight to get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $900,000 is a good price,  and while I was hoping for a bit more, continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely.  At this point, it's best to secure the sale and avoid the chance of ending up with John's lower offer."
