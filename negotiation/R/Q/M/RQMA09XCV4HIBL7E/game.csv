"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This price is fair, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair price, taking into account your budget and the product's worth to you.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000. This price allows for some profit for you, while still fitting within my budget. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price, taking into account your budget and the product's worth to you. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm offering it to you for $1,212,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my own needs. I hope we can finally find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1212500.0,Alice,7,
