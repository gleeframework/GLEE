Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but not too high that it would scare Bob off immediately.  I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to negotiate or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $80. I'm not willing to accept that price, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $90. This is still above my minimum value but a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and avoid having to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still below my initial desired price, but it's above my minimum value of $80.  It's also closer to my last counteroffer, so it seems like a reasonable compromise.  I'll accept his offer to avoid risking losing the sale and having to sell to John for less."
