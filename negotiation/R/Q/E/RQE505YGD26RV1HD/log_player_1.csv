Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $14,000 allows for potential bargaining without risking a complete rejection. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $12,000 gives me the confidence to push for a higher price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, creating a positive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but still below my minimum:**  While $12,500 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:**  I have the opportunity to push for a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob don't work out.

I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay above $12,000.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $13,250. This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, encouraging Bob to see it as a win-win situation. 
* **Remaining Firm:** I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $12,000, setting a firm boundary.

By offering $13,250, I'm trying to find a price that Bob is more likely to accept while ensuring I still get a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,250. Can you consider $12,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,875 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  It's unlikely that Bob will offer much more, and pushing for a higher price could risk losing him as a buyer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $12,000.

Considering the potential for a successful sale and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer, accepting his offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
