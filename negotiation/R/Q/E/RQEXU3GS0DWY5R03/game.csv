"Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However,  $10,000 is significantly below what I  had in mind. Could we meet in the middle at $11,500? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while still being a good deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
