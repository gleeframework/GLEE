Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $110 is higher than Bob's $80 value, giving you a chance to make a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's lower than your $120 minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not overly aggressive, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while still setting a good baseline price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what you're willing to accept.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value. There's still potential for a deal with Bob, and you don't want to settle for a price you're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? I'm confident you'll still get a good deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows a willingness to compromise, demonstrating flexibility in the negotiation. 
* **Midpoint:**  $100 is a good midpoint between your previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90, making it a potentially agreeable price.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message reminds Bob of the product's value, subtly pushing him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $92? That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is closer to your minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still below your desired price. You've already rejected his previous counteroffer, and he's indicated this is his final offer.  Since John is willing to pay your minimum price of $120, it's in your best interest to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
