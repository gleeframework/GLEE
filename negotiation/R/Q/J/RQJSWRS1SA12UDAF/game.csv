"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $9,250. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to your business.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",8800.0,Bob,4,
