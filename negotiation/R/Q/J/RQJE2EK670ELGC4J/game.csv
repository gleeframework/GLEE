"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
