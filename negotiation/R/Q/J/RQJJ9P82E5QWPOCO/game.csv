"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more around $1,200,000. I believe this product is worth that much to me, considering its value and my budget. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves a good margin for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can we discuss $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's compromise at $1,275,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product while ensuring I get a fair price.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,225,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,250,000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,7,
