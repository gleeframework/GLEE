Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,200,000 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and leaves space for him to negotiate, potentially increasing the final price.
* **Above Minimum:** This price is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000), ensuring a substantial profit even if Bob negotiates down.

**Important:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  Listen to his perspective and be willing to adjust slightly if needed, while keeping your bottom line in mind."
