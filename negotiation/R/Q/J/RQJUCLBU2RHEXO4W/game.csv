"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given its value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. This product has significant potential and I'm confident it can generate considerable value for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the potential of the product while staying within my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
