"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1000000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done, but I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist this offer. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $900000 just yet. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you, while also acknowledging your desire to negotiate. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $920000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $920000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $980000. This is a final compromise that I believe reflects the product's true value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
