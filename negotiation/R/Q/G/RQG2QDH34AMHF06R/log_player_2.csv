"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product for a special price. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Would you like to purchase it from me for $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $16,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $12,500 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $16,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob can still buy the product cheaper from John, Alice's offer of $14,000 is a good compromise. It's a lower price than her initial offer and still leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price in the future if he continues to push."
