"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference - how about $132.50? That way we both get a good deal.",132.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $132.50 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? That seems fair to both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
