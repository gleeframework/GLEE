"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I know you're interested in for $145.  I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.  Alice is offering it for $145. While this is a better price than John's, it's still more than the product is worth to you. You can do better.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate with her further or buy from John as a last resort."
