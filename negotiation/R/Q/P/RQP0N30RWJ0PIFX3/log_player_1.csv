Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $1,000,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $1,200,000 value to Bob, leaving space for him to counteroffer and for you to negotiate. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not an outrageous price, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob, but also be ready to accept John's offer if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your ideal price. By rejecting this offer, you can try to push for a higher price. You have room to negotiate, and Bob has shown he's willing to pay a premium for the product.  

Let's see if you can get closer to your desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000? This would still be a significant saving for you compared to the value you place on the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,100,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now firm on his offer of $1,100,000.  While it's not your ideal price, it's still a good profit and he's made a commitment to purchasing the product.  There's a risk in further negotiation that you might lose Bob as a buyer and end up selling to John for $1,000,000. 

This seems like the best option to ensure a sale and a good profit."
