"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to settle at $775,000 yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $825,000? It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $800,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $850,000? It's still a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,7,
