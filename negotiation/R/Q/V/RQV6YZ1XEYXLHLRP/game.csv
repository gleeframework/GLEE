"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is much higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both reasonable.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a significant gap from what I had in mind. The value this product brings to the table is substantial, and I can't let it go for less than $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. It's a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering our respective positions. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm moving in your direction as well. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer. However, I value our discussions and believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is my final offer.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product.  Let's finalize this deal and make it work for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
