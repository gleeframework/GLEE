"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking for something within my budget of $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $135 is still slightly out of my budget. I would like to propose $120 as the final price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our negotiation, but $120 is unfortunately not a price I can accept.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $127.50. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",127.5,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to counter with $125 as the final price for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",125.0,Bob,6,
