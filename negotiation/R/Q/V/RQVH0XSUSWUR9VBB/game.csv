"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to sell it for $11,000. This price still leaves you with a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While I value your offer, $10,750 doesn't quite meet my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $10,900 as a final compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would you consider selling it to me for $10,800?",10800.0,Bob,6,
