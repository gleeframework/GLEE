"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price higher than my minimum of $12,000.  I'm curious to see how Bob values the product and if he's willing to meet me at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a profit. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up in his offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm willing to accept his offer and secure a sale."
