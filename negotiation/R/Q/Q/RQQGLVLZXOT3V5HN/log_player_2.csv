"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your compromise, $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway -  how about $925,000? This price is still well below your estimated value, and it allows us both to walk away with a satisfactory deal.
