Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the value to you (which could weaken your position), the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies it's worth a significant amount.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's input and potential counter-offer.

Since you have a backup buyer (John) at $12,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob.  This strategy balances maximizing profit while still offering Bob a potentially attractive deal compared to finding the product elsewhere."
