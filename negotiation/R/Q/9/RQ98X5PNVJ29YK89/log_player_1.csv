"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without making it seem like I'm unwilling to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I consider fair.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  Bob's willingness to counteroffer shows he's interested. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for a better deal.** There's a good chance I can get a higher offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $10,500?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway.
* **Fairness:**  I'm highlighting the compromise as a fair solution for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and optimistic. 
* **Urgency Implied:** By suggesting a ""walk away happy"" scenario, I subtly imply there's a time limit on the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **More room for negotiation:** I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Not desperate:**  I'm not desperate to sell, as I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll come down to $10,000. That's my final offer. If you're not able to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm communicating that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, $9,000 is as low as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make a decision soon. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  He's not willing to budge significantly from his previous offers. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Guarantee a Higher Price:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **No More Time to Waste:** Further negotiation with Bob would likely result in a lower price and could ultimately lead to a dead end."
