"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit too high at $11,000. Let's try $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,500.  However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,
