"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see the value in this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a good price, I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $12,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit too high at $11,000. Let's try $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price.  While $10,500 is tempting, I'll counter Bob's offer once again and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,500.  However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
