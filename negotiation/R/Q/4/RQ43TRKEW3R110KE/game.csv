"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is outside of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is really my bottom line. I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000, but I can't go any lower than that.",16000.0,Alice,3,
