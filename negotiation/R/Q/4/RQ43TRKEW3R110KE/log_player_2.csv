"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $18,000, which reflects the true worth of its capabilities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $18,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's a significant gap between Alice's asking price and Bob's willingness to pay, leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is outside of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Clear and direct:** Bob's message clearly states his budget constraints and his continued interest in the product.
* **Reasonable counteroffer:**  $10,000 is Bob's maximum price, and it's a significant step down from Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about buying but also that he is willing to walk away if the price doesn't come down.
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""Let's see if we can find common ground"" indicates Bob's willingness to continue negotiating, potentially with a slight increase in his offer if Alice shows some flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is really my bottom line. I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000, but I can't go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has come down from $18,000, $16,000 is still outside of Bob's budget of $10,000.
* **Continue negotiation:** Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating with Alice. There's still room to find a compromise. 
* **John's offer remains a strong alternative:** The option of buying from John for $10,000 is still available, providing Bob with a fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $16,000 is still a bit high.  I'm firm on my maximum of $10,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to purchase.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reiterate budget:**  Bob reinforces his maximum budget of $10,000, showing Alice that he's serious and unlikely to budge further.
* **Directness:**  The message is straightforward and clear, leaving no room for ambiguity.
* **Open to closing:**  The phrase ""If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to purchase"" demonstrates Bob's readiness to close the deal at his proposed price. 
* **Pressure on Alice:**  By stating his willingness to purchase at $10,000, Bob puts the pressure on Alice to make a decision."
