Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,212,500 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the price I was initially willing to pay for the product from John. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's the same price I could get from John, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
