"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 2

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000? I think that's a fair price."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down in price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $825,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut the negotiations and buy from John for $800,000.  This saves $25,000 and avoids the risk of Alice not budging further."
