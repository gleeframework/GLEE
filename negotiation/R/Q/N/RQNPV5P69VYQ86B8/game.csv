"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000? I think that's a fair price.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, how about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're getting closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
