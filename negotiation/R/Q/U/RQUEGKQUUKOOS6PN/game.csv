"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still leaves room for you to profit from this purchase.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
