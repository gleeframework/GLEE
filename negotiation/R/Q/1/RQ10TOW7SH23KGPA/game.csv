"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $950000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm still trying to stay within my budget and make this a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $925000. This is my final offer in this range, so I hope you can meet me here.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $925000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think about buying from John at $800000 if we can't come to an agreement. Can you meet me at $900000 or lower?",900000.0,Bob,6,
