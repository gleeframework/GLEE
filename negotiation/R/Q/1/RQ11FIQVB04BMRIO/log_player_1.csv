Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's value but lower than my minimum. It allows for negotiation and hopefully leads to a win-win scenario.  I'll be ready to counter if needed, but I'll also keep John in mind if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120 for this product. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget.  Let's split the difference. How about $130? That's still a great deal for you and closer to my value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to counter with $125, which is still below my ideal price point but closer to what you're asking. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to take $125 to avoid the risk of further negotiation or losing the sale to John. It's a good compromise and secures a sale."
