Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure $1,100,000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,120,000. This is my last offer, and I'm not going to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000.
