Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still make a profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you're subtly reminding Bob of its worth and justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly if Bob declines, you create a sense of scarcity and potential loss for him. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable."
