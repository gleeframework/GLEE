,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can meet you in the middle at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $125?,125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I can go as low as $135, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $128 for the product, can you meet me at that price?",128.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll make the deal.",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $130, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I can meet you at $139, but that's my final offer. If you want the product, this is it.",139.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really disappointed that we couldn't come to an agreement. I'm willing to walk away, but I'll make one last offer: $129. If you can meet me at that price, I'll make the deal. If not, I'll buy it from John for $100.",129.0,Bob,10,
