"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. It's a great opportunity to own a valuable item worth more to you than its cost. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. While this is a good deal, you can potentially save more money by counter-offering.  There's a chance Alice will be willing to drop the price further to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your interest in the product, and I'm glad to work towards a fair deal. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $95 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while acknowledging its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is closer to your ideal price. However, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get the price even lower by counter-offering again. You still have some wiggle room before needing to buy from John."
