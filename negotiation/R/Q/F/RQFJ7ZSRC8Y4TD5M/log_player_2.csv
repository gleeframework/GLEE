"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to Bob, a price of $50 is a good deal. However, Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal. He offers $40, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for a back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $55 is still within Bob's budget of $80 and is a better deal than buying from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting the offer avoids the risk of losing the product and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
