Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer serves as a way to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's immediately put off by the price, you haven't lost anything. You can always negotiate down or proceed with John."
