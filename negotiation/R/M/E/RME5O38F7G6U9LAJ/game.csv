"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,020,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
