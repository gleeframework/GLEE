Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's important to start high and see how he reacts. If he rejects the offer, we can then gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, suggesting he might be undervaluing the product. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's lowball offer. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better sense of his true value for the product and can decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
