"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm starting high because I know how valuable this product is. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. It's above his maximum budget, and he has room to negotiate.  He should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, recognizing its value.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should continue to negotiate, as he is very close to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I see the value in the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute top limit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to make one more concession. My counteroffer is $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort we've put into the negotiation so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but Bob is very close to his goal of $1,000,000. At this point, it's in his best interest to just purchase from John.  The remaining rounds are unlikely to get a better price, and Bob has already invested a few rounds in negotiating with Alice."
