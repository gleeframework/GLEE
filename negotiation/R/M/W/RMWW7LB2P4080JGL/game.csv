"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $10,500 is a fair reflection of that. How about we meet in the middle?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit shy of $10,500. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference -  $10,150. This reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a great price.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we try $9,800 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9800.0,Bob,6,
