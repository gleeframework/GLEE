Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth the investment.

Alice has come down significantly, and you're only $250 away from your ideal price. It's likely that Alice won't budge further, so accepting her offer is the best option. You'll get a good deal, and you'll avoid the risk of losing the product to John."
