"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my highest offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000,  which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,5,
