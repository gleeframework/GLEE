"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a valuable item, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of the price. This might make Bob feel more inclined to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:**  By starting at $12,000, I can potentially negotiate down to a price that still gives me a profit and keeps Bob interested.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round, and I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining. I'll also be mindful of the $15,000 offer from John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my highest offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and much lower than my initial offer.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob says this is his ""highest offer,"" there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Value of Time:** I have 8 rounds left. I'm not desperate to sell, and I can use the remaining time to see if I can find a better deal with Bob or potentially use John's offer as leverage.

**Next Step:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000,  which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial $12,000 offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Middle Ground:**  $10,000 is a reasonable middle ground between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer.
* **Time is on My Side:**  I still have 7 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**  I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly, potentially moving closer to his offer or leveraging John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's willingness to compromise suggests he might be willing to go higher.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I can use John's $15,000 offer as leverage, potentially pushing Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **Time Remaining:** I have 6 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to accept a suboptimal offer.

**Next Step:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $10,000. I'll also consider using John's offer as leverage if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm making a small compromise by coming down from $10,000 to $9,500, showing a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I'm emphasizing fairness and the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Time is Running Out:**  I still have 5 rounds left, but the time is ticking, and I need to start moving closer to a potential agreement.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still leverage John's $15,000 offer to potentially push him further.

**Next Steps:**  I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob continues to reject offers, I'll need to make a decision on whether to accept his offer, risk another round of negotiations, or go with John's offer."
