"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite comfortable with that price point. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. How about we meet in the middle between our initial offer and your counteroffer at $1,000,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.
