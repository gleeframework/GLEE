# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1,200,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

It's not a good idea to accept Alice's offer at $1,200,000 because you are willing to pay only $1,000,000.  You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

It's still better to reject the offer and try to negotiate further.  While $1,050,000 is closer to your maximum price, you can still try to get a better deal."
