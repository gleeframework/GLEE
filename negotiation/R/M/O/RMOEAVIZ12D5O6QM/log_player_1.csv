"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it seem like you're willing to compromise. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The opening offer is above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value without being overly aggressive. 

This initial offer allows us to gather information about Bob's negotiation style and potentially secure a favorable deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value of the product. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. We have time and leverage since we have a backup offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a starting point, it falls short of the value this product brings. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  We're coming down from the initial offer but staying significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a strong outcome.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the compromise and reiterating the product's value, we aim to keep Bob engaged and emphasize that we're not easily budging.
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer and is now above our guaranteed sale price with John. While we could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could stall. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and concludes the deal quickly."
