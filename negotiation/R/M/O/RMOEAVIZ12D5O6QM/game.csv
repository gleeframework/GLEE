"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a starting point, it falls short of the value this product brings. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
