"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product brings, and $700,000 falls quite a bit below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This allows you to benefit significantly while still reflecting the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I'm still very interested.  How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $750,000 is closer, I can't accept that price.  It's worth considerably more to both of us. How about we make this our final offer: $825,000.  This ensures you're getting a great deal on a product that will really benefit you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
