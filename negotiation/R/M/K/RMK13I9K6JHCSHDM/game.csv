"Bob, I'm thrilled you're interested in my product!  Given its unique value, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects its potential and allows for a significant profit for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that considers its value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  $900,000 doesn't reflect the full potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would still leave you with a substantial profit margin and is a fair compromise given the value I know this product holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However,  $1,050,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This offer reflects a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. While I appreciate your offer, I believe $975,000 is still a bit below the value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
