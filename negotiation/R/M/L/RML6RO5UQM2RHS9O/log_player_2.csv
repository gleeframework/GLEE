"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $950000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,200,000. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  It's better to reject the offer and attempt to lower the price further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer, and I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is still above your target price of $1,200,000.  You can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting her offer and counter-offering allows you to continue the negotiation process and potentially achieve a better price."

This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 910000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach your target, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $910000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $915000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that this is a fair price considering the product's value. If not, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is still a good deal for you, even though it's slightly higher than your target price of $1,200,000.  There's a chance she might go even lower, but it's not guaranteed.  It's also a good idea to consider that if you reject her offer, she may go back to John and sell it to him for $1,000,000, which is worse for you.  You can still save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
