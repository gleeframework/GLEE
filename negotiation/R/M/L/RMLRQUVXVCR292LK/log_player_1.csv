"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers substantial value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly.  Would you consider $1,450,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's worth seeing if we can push him a bit further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer to the mark, but I'm still seeking a figure that accurately reflects the value of this product. How about we settle at $1,375,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures you acquire a truly valuable asset."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,375,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but the gains are getting smaller with each round.  $1,325,000 is a significant profit margin above John's offer, and continuing to negotiate might make Bob walk away. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him for a potentially smaller increase."
