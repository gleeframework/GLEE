"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product is worth considerably more to me based on its broader potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
