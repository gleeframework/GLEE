"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $12,000. This is a significant profit for me, and it's also a good starting point for negotiation, given that the product is worth $15,000 to him. I'm confident that he'll find this offer appealing, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's willingness to pay $15,000. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more enticing than his previous offer, and we can close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up just a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $9,500. This is a compromise, as it's higher than his offer, but still lower than my previous offer. I believe it's a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as what John is willing to pay. It seems like we're at an impasse with Bob, so I'll choose to sell the product to John for $8,000 to avoid further negotiation."
