Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling for $11,000 is a substantial profit over John's offer of $8,000."
