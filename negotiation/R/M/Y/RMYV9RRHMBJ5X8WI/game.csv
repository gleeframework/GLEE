"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the value the product brings to your business. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm willing to make a deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the value the product brings to your business. How about we meet in the middle again at $13,500? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm willing to make a deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
