"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  Starting high gives me more room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Appeal to value:** Emphasizing the value to Bob positions it as a potential bargain even though it's above his perceived value.
* **Open to discussion:**  Inviting further conversation allows for a more collaborative negotiation. 

**Important note:**  While $2,000,000 is a very high starting point, it's crucial to remember that my minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000 (John's offer).  I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to that number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, so I can afford to be firm with Bob.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range. 

I'll counter with a price closer to $1,500,000 in the next round. This keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is still a significant bargain, and it allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility but not giving away too much.
* **Highlight value to Bob:**  Reminding him of the product's worth to him strengthens my position.
* **Set a clear price:**  This counteroffer establishes a firm price point for further negotiations.

This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price, meaning I can't do better with Bob.
* **John's offer is equivalent:**  John is also offering $1,500,000, so there's no advantage to selling to him at this point.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Accepting Bob's offer avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds where I might have to lower my price even further.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price, closing the deal efficiently."
