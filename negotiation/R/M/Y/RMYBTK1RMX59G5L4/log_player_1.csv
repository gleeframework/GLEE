{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth significantly more to you.  Let's start with a good price and see if we can finalize this quickly."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to what I believe the product is truly worth.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I won't accept anything below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  That's still a great price for you considering the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. I'm still committed to getting this deal done, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous numbers and offer $1,012,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,012,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if we can reach a more favorable price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,012,500 isn't quite there yet. Let's try $1,050,000.  This is a good compromise that gives us both a fair price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there on the price.  Let's try $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that keeps us both in the green.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, I've already negotiated quite a bit and I need to consider the time factor. Accepting Bob's offer of $1,025,000 guarantees a sale above my minimum goal."
