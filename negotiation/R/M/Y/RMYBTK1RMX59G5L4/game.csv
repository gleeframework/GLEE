"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth significantly more to you.  Let's start with a good price and see if we can finalize this quickly.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to what I believe the product is truly worth.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  That's still a great price for you considering the value you'll receive.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. I'm still committed to getting this deal done, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous numbers and offer $1,012,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1012500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,012,500 isn't quite there yet. Let's try $1,050,000.  This is a good compromise that gives us both a fair price.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there on the price.  Let's try $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that keeps us both in the green.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
