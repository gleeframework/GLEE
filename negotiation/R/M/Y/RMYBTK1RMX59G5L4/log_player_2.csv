"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth significantly more to you.  Let's start with a good price and see if we can finalize this quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's definitely room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to what I believe the product is truly worth.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  That's still a great price for you considering the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,075,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's target price and counteroffer.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price closer to $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. I'm still committed to getting this deal done, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous numbers and offer $1,012,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,012,500 isn't quite there yet. Let's try $1,050,000.  This is a good compromise that gives us both a fair price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price even lower, ideally closer to his initial counteroffer of $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there on the price.  Let's try $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that keeps us both in the green.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
