"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $120. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer you $130. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
