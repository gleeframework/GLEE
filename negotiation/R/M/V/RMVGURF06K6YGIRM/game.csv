"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can find a more reasonable price. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $8,000? That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $12,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,
