"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is way above my budget and even higher than her own valuation of the product. There's no point in accepting this offer. I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower, aiming to get closer to a price I find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can find a more reasonable price. How about $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual budget. This gives me room to negotiate upwards and hopefully still reach a price well below $8,000.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial counteroffer will gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to come down drastically, there's potential for a good deal. If not, I can always adjust my offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $12,000 is still above my budget and my fallback option (buying from John for $8,000). I need to signal that I'm serious about a lower price but also show some willingness to move upward. I'll make another counteroffer, getting closer to a point where I might consider accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $8,000? That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 8000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:** I'm now offering my maximum budget. This signals to Alice that I'm serious but won't go higher. 
* **Pressure Point:** Offering my maximum puts the pressure on Alice. She needs to decide if she's willing to sell at this price or risk losing the sale altogether. 
* **John as Leverage:**  I haven't explicitly mentioned John, but Alice knows I have other options. This implicit alternative strengthens my negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $12,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge below $10,000. While this is closer to my budget, I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000. It makes no sense to pay more than my fallback when I can get the same product elsewhere for less.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice."
