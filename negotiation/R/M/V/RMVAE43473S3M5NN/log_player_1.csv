Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

I'm not willing to sell for my minimum price yet, so I'll counter Bob's offer.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. While $1250000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a little above my limit. I'm prepared to offer $1150000. This shows a good faith effort on my part, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.

I'm still hoping to get a better price than Bob's current offer, so I'll reject and counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  My final counteroffer is $1,200,000.
