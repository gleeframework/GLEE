"I understand that you're working within a budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
