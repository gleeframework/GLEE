"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This represents a significant discount and shows my serious interest in making this deal happen.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price takes into account your budget and the product's value. I believe it's a fair price for both parties.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
