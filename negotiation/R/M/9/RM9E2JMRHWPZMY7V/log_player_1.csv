Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get more from Bob, I'm not confident I can get a higher price from him.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and it saves me time and effort."
