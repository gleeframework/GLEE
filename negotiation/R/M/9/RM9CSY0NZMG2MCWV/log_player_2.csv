"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is $120. This means there's room for negotiation.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $120 and my maximum willingness to pay of $150.
* This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm willing to compromise.
* It also leaves some room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $125, which is still within my budget of $150.
* It's only $5 higher than my last counteroffer, and there's a risk that further negotiation will lead to a higher price or a stalemate.
* Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the potential for a more expensive outcome with John or a failed negotiation with Alice."
