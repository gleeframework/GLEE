Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than the $8,000 Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $9,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It signals your willingness to negotiate:** Offering a price slightly below your ideal price shows Bob you're open to discussion.

However, the strategy will change depending on Bob's response. We need to be ready to adjust our offer based on his counteroffers or potentially accept the John's offer if Bob's negotiation becomes too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is significantly below our minimum value of $10,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $8,000. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for us.
* **We have a better alternative:** We can still sell the product to John for $10,000, which is our ideal price.
* **Counteroffering might work:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, we can try to counteroffer him. A counteroffer might lead to a more acceptable price. 

We will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to our minimum while still attempting to find a price that is acceptable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering your interest, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer above minimum:** This counteroffer is still above our minimum of $10,000, ensuring we make a profit.
* **Meeting Bob halfway:** We've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on fairness:** We're framing the offer as a ""fair price"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially encouraging him to accept.

This counteroffer strategically balances our need for a good price with the potential for a successful deal with Bob. We'll see how he reacts to this new offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to our minimum:**  $8,250 is only $750 below our minimum of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a quick deal:**  Accepting this offer will finalize the deal with Bob, avoiding further negotiation and the risk of him walking away.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** While we could sell to John for $10,000, accepting Bob's offer would require less effort and still result in a good profit.

Given the proximity to our minimum and the potential for a quick agreement, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best strategy."
