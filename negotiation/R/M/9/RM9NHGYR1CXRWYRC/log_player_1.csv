"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and counter with a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $17,500. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get Bob to move further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $16,000.  This is a significant reduction, but it's still above my minimum. With only 5 rounds left, I need to be more flexible, but I'm still hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$13,000 is still below my minimum, and with only 4 rounds left, I need to make sure I get a price I'm happy with.  I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

With only three rounds left, I'm going to stick to my minimum price of $15,000. It's a risk, but I believe the product is worth it, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I don't have much negotiating power.  It's unlikely Bob will move much higher than $14,000, and that's still below my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. It's a guaranteed sale, and it's worth more than what Bob is offering."
