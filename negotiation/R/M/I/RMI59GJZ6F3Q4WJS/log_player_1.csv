Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'd like to offer you. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. I've also added a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my absolute minimum ($80), it's still lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's a fair price, and it still gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm countering with $85. This is closer to my initial offer, but still shows some flexibility. I'm also highlighting the good deal he's getting at this price to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $82 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
