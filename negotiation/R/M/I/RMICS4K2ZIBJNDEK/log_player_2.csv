# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $100.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92.

You can still try to negotiate a lower price.  You're closer to your goal of $85.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $85. How about we split the difference and go with $88.50?"", ""product_price"": 88.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $95, which is a bit higher than your initial offer, but still a good discount from the original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd prefer to pay closer to your initial $85, Alice has come down to $95, which is a reasonable compromise.  Buying from John for $120 would be a worse deal."
