"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? I believe this might be closer to what we can agree upon.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  While the product's value is significant to someone with your plans for it, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,275,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth.  What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I've reviewed Alice's latest offer and while it's a step in the right direction, I still feel there's room for further negotiation. Could we possibly aim for $1,200,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement without compromising too much on either side.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
