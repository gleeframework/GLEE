""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I've carefully considered its worth to you, and I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a fair deal that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from owning it."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** Your minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000 (John's offer). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, you want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without going over.
* **The Offer:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 leaves a good margin for you while still being a very attractive price for Bob, making it likely he'll accept.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
