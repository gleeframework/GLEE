"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a little below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
