"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a little below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
