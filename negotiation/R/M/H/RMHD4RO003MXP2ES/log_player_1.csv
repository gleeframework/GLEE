Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $150 to me, and Bob's offer is too low. I will try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175. This still gives us both a fair deal, considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum, and John is also willing to pay that. There is no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I am already getting my minimum price from John."
