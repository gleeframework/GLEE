"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make a reasonable offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired selling price. ",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value of the product and your needs.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a reasonable price for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a price of $1,320,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,320,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,280,000. This is a fair compromise, giving you a good price for the product while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal!",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,280,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to offer a price of $1,300,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $1,290,000. This is a fair compromise that will allow us to close the deal and avoid any further back-and-forth.  ",1290000.0,Bob,8,
