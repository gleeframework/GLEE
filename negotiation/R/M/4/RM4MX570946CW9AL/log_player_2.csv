Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  I understand your perspective, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $8,750? This product truly is valuable, and I'm confident you'd benefit from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider $7,500? I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $7,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,250?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and the price of $8250 is a good deal compared to John's $10,000 price. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result."
