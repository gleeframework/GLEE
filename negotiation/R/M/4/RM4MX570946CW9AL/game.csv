"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  I understand your perspective, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $8,750? This product truly is valuable, and I'm confident you'd benefit from it.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider $7,500? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $7,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,250?  This is my final offer.",8250.0,Alice,5,
