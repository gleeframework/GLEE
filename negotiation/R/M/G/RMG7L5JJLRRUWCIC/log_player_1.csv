Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $125 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $125 is above your minimum price of $100, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $125 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price based on his counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it would be a loss for me. I can do better.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer, aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? It's still a great deal considering the value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is above my minimum:** $105 is still above my minimum price of $100, ensuring I make a profit.
* **It's a compromise:** $105 is a compromise between my initial offer of $125 and Bob's offer of $90, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can still adjust my price further.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and keep the negotiation moving forward while still ensuring I get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $95 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm not thrilled about selling to John for $100, it's a better option than accepting Bob's offer and losing money. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll sell the product to John for $100 and move on.  It's not ideal, but it's the most financially sound decision at this point."
