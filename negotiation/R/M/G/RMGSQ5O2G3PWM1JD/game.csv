"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about we start at $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $80?  It's fair to both of us, and I can get the product right away.",80.0,Bob,4,
