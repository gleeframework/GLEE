"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll receive. Let's start with this figure and see where we can go from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify spending a fraction of that.  Would you consider $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, but the gap is still too large.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 just doesn't make sense for me. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a substantial discount from my original asking price.  This is a fair offer that acknowledges your budget while also allowing me to recoup a reasonable portion of my investment. Let's make this deal happen. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000.  While she might budge a little, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the guaranteed $800,000 deal with John."
