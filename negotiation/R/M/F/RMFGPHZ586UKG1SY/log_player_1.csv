{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  He's willing to pay $120, so $140 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** You won't settle for less than $150, but this offer gives you room to adjust if needed.
* **It's a clear, friendly message:**  It establishes a positive tone and sets the stage for a potential deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $120 is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $130?  That's still a great price for this amazing product!"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Could we possibly meet at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is insistent on $120, which is below my minimum.  Rather than continue a potentially lengthy negotiation with him, I'll go ahead and sell the product to John for $150.  It's a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum price."
