"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true value of this product and its potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is my best offer considering its unique benefits.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has unique benefits, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. You're right that market comparisons are important, but this product offers advantages that others simply don't. To move forward, I'm willing to consider $2,000,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer given the product's unique value.",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, considering its value to me and the market value of similar products.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
