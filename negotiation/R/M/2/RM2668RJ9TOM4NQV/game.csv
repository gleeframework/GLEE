"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least receive $1,300,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $1,500,000. Let's work together to find a solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Can we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
