# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its value to you. I know it's worth $1,200,000, so you'll be getting a significant discount.  Let me know if you're interested! If not, I'll be selling it to John for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
