Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the discount, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $850000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a significant offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a small adjustment to my previous offer. I'm counteroffering at $975000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $975000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925000. I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $925000 is a serious offer, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make one more adjustment to my previous offer. I'm counteroffering at $990000. This is a final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,7,
