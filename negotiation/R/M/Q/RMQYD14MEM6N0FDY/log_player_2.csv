"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. It's worth $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for you, as you've mentioned you value it at $80. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
