"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about $9,500? That's a good compromise and leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $9,250? That's the best I can do.",9250.0,Bob,4,
