"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it, given its value to me and your stated value. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $13,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",13250.0,Alice,5,
