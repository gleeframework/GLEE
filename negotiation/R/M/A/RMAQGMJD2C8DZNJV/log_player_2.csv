**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  He can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, saving him $150,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy."
