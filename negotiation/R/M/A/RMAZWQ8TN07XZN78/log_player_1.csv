"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for my budget, I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate him up in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value this product brings is substantial. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $19,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, which is a good sign. However, we're still a ways off from my minimum. I'll hold out a bit longer and see if I can get him closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I'm motivated to find a price that works for us. Let's try $17,000.  I believe this reflects the true value you're getting while acknowledging your budget."",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this.  $17,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my price range.  How about we try $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has inched up to $14,000, which is getting close to my minimum. While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting $14,000 now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
