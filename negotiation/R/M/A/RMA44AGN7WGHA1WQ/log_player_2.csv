"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  It's still better to reject and continue negotiating, as Bob can still get a better deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still above what I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $10000. I think this is a fair price, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000. This saves Bob $2,000 compared to Alice's offer."
