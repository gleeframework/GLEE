"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $8500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still above what I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $10000. I think this is a fair price, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value the product will bring to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
