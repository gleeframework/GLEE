"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just too low. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't go lower than $100. That's the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. This product is truly worth more, but I'm making an exception for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting the $100 offer is the best way to maximize savings."
