"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've thought about it and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $8,500 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I can do $8,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $8,000. Let's say... $7,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",7500.0,Alice,5,
