{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price.**  This suggests there is room for negotiation. 
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.**  It's worth exploring if you can get an even better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's your last resort.** You want to see if you can save money by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that you are serious about getting a good deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $400,000 is a big jump down, it still leaves room for both of us to meet in the middle. 
* **Early Bargaining:** This establishes an aggressive negotiation stance early on, potentially putting pressure on Alice to consider your offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good price.
* **Midpoint Approach:**  $450,000 is roughly the midpoint between $400,000 and $500,000, making it a reasonable and potentially appealing offer for Alice.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 6 rounds left, there's still time to see if we can reach an agreement."

* **I have 5 rounds remaining.**  There's time to continue negotiating for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still the last resort.** I believe I can still get a better deal from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is the midpoint between my previous offer of $450,000 and Alice's current offer of $550,000. This shows a clear willingness to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Increased Pressure:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is on for both of us to close the deal. This counteroffer puts the ball back in Alice's court, encouraging her to consider my offer.
* **Balanced Approach:**  While I still want to save as much money as possible, I'm also aware that time is running out. This offer balances my desire for a good deal with the need to avoid buying from John at a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my initial counteroffer.**  It's a sign that we're both getting closer to an agreement.
* **Time is running out.** With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Alice increases. 
* **Buying from John is still an option, but it's expensive.**  While $600,000 is not my ideal price, it's better than paying $1,200,000.

This seems like a reasonable point to accept the offer, as continuing to negotiate could result in not reaching an agreement at all."
