Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

This is a lowball offer from Bob, significantly below both of our valuations. It's important to hold firm and negotiate strategically.  We will counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $2,000,000 is still too high for me. To be honest, my budget caps out at $1,500,000. I can offer you that amount, but I can't go any higher.  It's a fair offer, so what do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price. It's best to accept and close the deal, ensuring we get the product's full value."
