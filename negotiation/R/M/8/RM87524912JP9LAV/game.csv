"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $2,000,000 is still too high for me. To be honest, my budget caps out at $1,500,000. I can offer you that amount, but I can't go any higher.  It's a fair offer, so what do you say?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
