Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a steal! I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a fantastic deal on something you'll truly value."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if needed while maximizing potential profit.
* **Creating urgency and value:** Phrasing like ""limited time"" and ""steal"" are sales tactics to encourage a quicker decision and make Bob perceive the offer as more valuable. 
* **Leaving John as a backup:**  Knowing John will buy at $15,000 provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the initial high price, you can negotiate down, knowing you won't go below your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually decrease your asking price, but never go below your $15,000 safety net."
