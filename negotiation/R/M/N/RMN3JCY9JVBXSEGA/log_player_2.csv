"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have nothing to lose by trying to negotiate, and you might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.  This counteroffer is half of her initial price, which is a significant drop. This should make Alice think that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, it's still not within my acceptable range.  I can continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get a better price, or I can purchase from John.  Since I have a guaranteed alternative with John, I don't need to accept this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $900,000, which is closer to Alice's counteroffer but still under my maximum budget.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to pay more, but I'm still not willing to meet her price.  Hopefully, this will lead to a more favorable outcome."
