Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is my opening gambit and will give me some room to negotiate.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $1,000,000 as possible, but I'm also hoping to get closer to the maximum value possible for Bob.  

It's important to remember that I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd love to sell the product for more, I'm willing to negotiate further. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also showing Bob that I'm still confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm not confident that I'll get a better offer in the next round. Selling to Bob for $900,000 is still a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
