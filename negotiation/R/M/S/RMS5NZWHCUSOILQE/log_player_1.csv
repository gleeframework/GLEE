"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. This is a very valuable piece with a lot of potential. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,500,000, which is significantly above my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room to negotiate down while still achieving a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value, which is crucial for building a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate, which encourages Bob to counteroffer and keeps the dialogue open. 

**Remember:** This is just the first round. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer now keeps the negotiation process going and allows me to potentially get a better deal.  
* **Time is on my side:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to work towards a higher price.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price, but still leaving room for compromise.  I'll try to find a middle ground that encourages Bob to accept."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a bit higher to reflect the product's unique value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** My counteroffer of $1,400,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  The message reiterates the product's unique value, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Positive and Encouraging:**  The tone is positive and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation by asking for his thoughts.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to gradually decrease my price while maintaining a firm stance. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway. I'm also aware of the time constraint and the alternative offer from John, so I'm prepared to be flexible to close the deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $1,300,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. 
* **Time is on my side:**  With 6 rounds left, I can afford to continue negotiating, aiming for a slightly higher price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob's offer indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate.  By rejecting, I maintain control and signal my willingness to bargain further.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,350,000. This will hopefully entice Bob to accept while still allowing me to secure a more profitable deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,350,000.

```

* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and encourages further negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Value and Compromise:** I reiterate the product's value while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, moving us closer to a deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. This counteroffer is a strategic move to gauge Bob's willingness to close the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to consider my options more carefully in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000. Can you consider my revised offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is Still on My Side:** We have 4 rounds remaining, which is enough time to continue negotiating. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Bob's offer indicates he's still interested and willing to negotiate. Rejecting allows me to see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between $1,250,000 and my initial asking price of $1,500,000. I will try to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. I will also be mindful of the time remaining and the alternative offer from John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be fair here.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This is a good compromise that keeps the deal moving forward for both of us.  Let's try to close this out."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a final attempt to bridge the gap. It's halfway between my previous offer ($1,350,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,250,000).
* **Urgency:** The message highlights the need to close the deal, increasing the pressure on Bob. 
* **Reasonable Price:** $1,300,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer to Bob's range. 

**Strategy:**

This is a high-stakes round. If Bob rejects, I have very little room to maneuver. I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough to encourage Bob to accept, ensuring a good outcome.  I'm also prepared to consider the offer from John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1275000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing Time:**  We are down to the final two rounds. If I reject, I risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Acceptable Price:** $1,275,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Secure the Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. There's no guarantee that we can reach a better price in the remaining round.

**Next Steps:**

While I'm not thrilled with the price, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure the deal. It's a calculated risk, but with only two rounds left, it's the most prudent decision."
