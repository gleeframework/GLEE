"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the price I'm willing to pay for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to Bob, and $100 to John. Even though Bob is offering $100, which is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is offering more than John, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to take a risk and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $102. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $100.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'm still hoping to get a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $100.5 is a good outcome. It's a small increase over John's offer of $100, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward with a potential buyer who values the product highly."
