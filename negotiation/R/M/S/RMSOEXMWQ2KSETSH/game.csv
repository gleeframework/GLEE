"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the price I'm willing to pay for it.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $102. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $100.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.5,Bob,6,
