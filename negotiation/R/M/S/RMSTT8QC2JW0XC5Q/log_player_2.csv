"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to try to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to get a price closer to his maximum budget. This counteroffer is a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget, but it's closer to it than her initial offer. Considering the potential risks of further negotiation (Alice might not budge further, and the process could take time), it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer. He's saving $50,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable compromise."
