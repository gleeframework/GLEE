"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening move, designed to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident in the value of my product and want to maximize my profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my price based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's lower offer while still pushing for a price closer to my initial target. I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. It's still early in the game, and I'm not giving up on getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is another compromise, showing flexibility and attempting to bridge the gap between our current positions. I'm hoping that by consistently counteroffering with a price closer to my minimum, I can convince Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price, and we've already had several rounds of negotiation without much progress. I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a low price. Selling to John at $1,500,000 ensures I get my minimum value. It's a safer choice than continuing to negotiate with Bob, who seems unwilling to budge."
