"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $95?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget. While I'm not able to go down to $95, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This would still allow me to make a fair profit while staying within your range. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me.  Would you be willing to go to $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
