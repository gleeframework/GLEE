Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

* **We're approaching the middle ground.** Alice's offer is only $25,000 away from your last counteroffer.
