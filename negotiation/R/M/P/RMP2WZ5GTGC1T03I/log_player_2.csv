"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth $14000. We're confident this investment will provide significant returns for you. Let's discuss how we can make this work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, but unfortunately, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our product's quality and the value it brings to you, I propose a price of $13500. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another chance to try and get a lower price. There are still several rounds left, so there's potential to get closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  I'm confident this price is fair considering the value I see in your product and my budget limitations."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement, Bob. To move forward, I propose a price of $13250 for the product. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle of our current positions. I believe this will be a fair compromise for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget. With only 5 rounds left, there's a high chance that the negotiations will continue to drag on without reaching a satisfactory price for Bob. It's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John at $12,000, ensuring a guaranteed deal within his budget."
