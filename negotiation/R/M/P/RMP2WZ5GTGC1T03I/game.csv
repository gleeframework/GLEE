"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, but unfortunately, $14000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $12500, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our product's quality and the value it brings to you, I propose a price of $13500.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product.  I'm confident this price is fair considering the value I see in your product and my budget limitations.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement, Bob. To move forward, I propose a price of $13250 for the product. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle of our current positions. I believe this will be a fair compromise for both parties.",13250.0,Alice,5,
