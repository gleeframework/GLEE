Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I am still hoping to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible for us to negotiate further towards my budget of $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored to his $80 budget and doesn't seem willing to budge.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from him. It's more profitable to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $100 from John."
