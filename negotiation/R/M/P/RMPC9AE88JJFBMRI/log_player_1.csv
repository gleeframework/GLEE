Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, an investment reflecting its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Confident Language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to entice Bob without revealing your guaranteed sale to John. 

**Outcome:**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts the $950,000, netting you a higher profit.
* **Acceptable Case:** Bob negotiates but you agree on a price above $1,000,000.
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer, you sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
