Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has incentive to counteroffer, potentially getting a better price.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher opening price might make Bob immediately reject the offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $9,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. How about we meet at $10,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is close to my minimum desired price of $8,000 and it's better than selling to John. This is a good deal for me, considering the potential risk of further negotiation or a deal with John falling through."
