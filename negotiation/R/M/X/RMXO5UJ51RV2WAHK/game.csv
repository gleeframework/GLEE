"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential impact on your business. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to reap substantial benefits while acknowledging the true value of what you're acquiring.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's split the difference and go with $1,300,000. This price allows me to move forward with the purchase while still staying within my budget. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  Your understanding of this product's value is evident, and I want to make this deal happen.  How about we meet halfway at $1,325,000? This reflects my commitment to a win-win solution.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
