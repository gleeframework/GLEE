"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my current budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my current financial limitations. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given the value of the product and its potential impact on your business, I am willing to consider $1,275,000 as a compromise. This price reflects a slight adjustment from our initial offer and provides some flexibility for both parties. I hope we can reach an agreement that meets our respective needs.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,275,000 is still a bit out of my price range. As I mentioned before, $1,200,000 is the absolute maximum I can afford at this time.  This price allows for a mutually beneficial transaction while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work with me.  While $1,225,000 is a good offer, it's still slightly above my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  My final offer is $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product and my financial limitations. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Bob,6,
