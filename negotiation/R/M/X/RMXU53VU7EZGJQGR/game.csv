"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll find it meets all your needs and exceeds your expectations. I'm willing to offer it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $25000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid the product's value to me is much higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is my best counteroffer for now.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18000. However, it's still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and closer to my maximum budget. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to continue the negotiation. However, $10000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to offer it to you for $16000. This is my best compromise for now.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in the product, but $16000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This is a good compromise for me and hopefully a fair price for you.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $12000 is still not enough to meet my minimum price. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you for $17000. This is my final compromise.",17000.0,Alice,7,
