"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This is based on the fact that I don't know Bob's valuation.  It's a strong opening position that leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is getting close to my minimum but still leaves a little room for negotiation if Bob is willing to meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're getting close to my minimum price, but Bob seems unwilling to go any higher, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk getting less from Bob."
