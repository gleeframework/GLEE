**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, accepting Bob's offer at $1,115,000 is a strong deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price is $115,000 above our minimum acceptable price and represents a healthy profit margin.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly interested and has steadily increased his offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling. 
* **Time Value:**  Every round that passes is a chance for unforeseen circumstances to arise.  Securing a good deal now is generally preferable to risking the unknown."
