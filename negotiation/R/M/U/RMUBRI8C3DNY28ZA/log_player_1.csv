"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room to lower the price if necessary. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate.  I'm also keeping in mind the backup offer from John at $1,500,000, so I have a safety net if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,600,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher amount.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,700,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. I believe this counteroffer is fair and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to secure a deal.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit, and I can always try to negotiate a better price with future buyers."
