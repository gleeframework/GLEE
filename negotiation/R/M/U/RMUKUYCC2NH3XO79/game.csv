,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the bottom of the price range I'm willing to consider. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a price that's closer to the value I believe the product is worth. I'm thinking of $1040000.
