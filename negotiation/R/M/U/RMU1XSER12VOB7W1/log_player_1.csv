Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's value of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation and ensures I get more than my minimum of $120. I'm also keeping John's offer of $120 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial $80 value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it seems like Bob isn't willing to meet my price. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120 to ensure I get my desired profit."
