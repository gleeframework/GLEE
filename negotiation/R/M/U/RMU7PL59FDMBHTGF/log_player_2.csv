"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer or buy from John right away.  You have no information about the product's value to Alice.  Rejecting allows you to explore if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and understand her desired price point.  If she rejects this, I can adjust my counteroffer in subsequent rounds based on her reaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'd like to pay. I'm going to continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price.  I still have several rounds left, and there's potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good price. I'm hoping this is a sweet spot where Alice might be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer. While $1,150,000 is still higher than my last counteroffer, it's approaching a point where it's worth accepting. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether.  I'm willing to accept this offer and save a considerable amount compared to buying from John."
