"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 Alice's offer is quite high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

We're starting with a reasonably ambitious counter-offer.  This probes Alice's willingness to negotiate and leaves us room to increase our offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price. How about we split the difference and go with $115? That way, we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm happy with. Let's see if we can push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about $105? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

We're moving closer to the middle ground. This offer maintains a downward pressure on the price while showing Alice we're willing to be reasonable."
