"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $90, which is a significant discount from my original price. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle somewhere, say around $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think $75 is still a bit low for me. I can do $95, which is my best offer. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
