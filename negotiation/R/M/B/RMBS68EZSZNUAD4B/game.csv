"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $100 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it, which is still a good deal for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $95. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $95 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $92 for it. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",92.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go down to $92, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $97. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",97.0,Alice,7,
