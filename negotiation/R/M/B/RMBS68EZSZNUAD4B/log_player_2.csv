{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120.  I can get it from John for $80, so I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it."", ""product_price"": 85}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to stick with my strategy of gradually increasing my offer.  $90 is still a good deal for Alice, and I'm hoping she'll see the value in getting the sale now rather than risking losing me to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $95. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $95 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $92 for it. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to increase my offer incrementally, trying to find a price that's close enough to my target without risking losing Alice completely. $92 is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful she'll accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go down to $92, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $97. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still not within my budget.  I've already made several counteroffers, and we're only a few dollars apart. However, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too high.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $80, which is the best deal I can get at this point."
