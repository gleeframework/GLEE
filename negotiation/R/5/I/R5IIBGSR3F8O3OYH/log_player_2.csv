"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds significant value to both of us. This product, which I believe will greatly benefit and enhance your endeavors, is priced at $1,300,000. My goal is to ensure that we both achieve a fair transaction that respects the worth of the product to you and the investment I have made into it. I look forward to discussing this further and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than what John is offering. You can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
