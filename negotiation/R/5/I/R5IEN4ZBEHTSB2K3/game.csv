"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline the $12,500 offer. To ensure we're both satisfied with the transaction, I propose a price of $14,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that considers both the value of the product to you and its worth to us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $13,250. This feels like a fair price that balances both our needs.",13250.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,750 is still a little too high for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is the absolute maximum I can do, and I believe it's a fair compromise that will allow us to reach an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
