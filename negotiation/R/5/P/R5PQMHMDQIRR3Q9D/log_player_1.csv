Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?

Round 3

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm getting closer to my budget limit. How about we settle at $14,000? It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $14,000.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
