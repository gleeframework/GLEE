"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $110**. This is less than your maximum budget of $120.
* **Buying from John would cost you $120**.
* **Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $10.** 

It's always beneficial to take the lower price option when possible."
