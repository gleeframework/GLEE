"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering your asking price and my budget. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $750,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $750,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000. This is a significant amount for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to make this work.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $725,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
