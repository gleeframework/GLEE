Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for something closer to $60.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll reach $100. I have a guaranteed offer from John, and it's not worth the risk of Bob not budging further."
