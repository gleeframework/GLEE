Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob the full $10,000. While I know it's worth less to him, I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll then start negotiating down, but I'll always have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping I can get a bit closer to my asking price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $9,800. This is a slight compromise from my original price, but it's still closer to my minimum than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to sway him, but I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. John's offer guarantees me my minimum, and it's not worth risking a longer negotiation with Bob for a small potential gain."
