"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's significantly above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
