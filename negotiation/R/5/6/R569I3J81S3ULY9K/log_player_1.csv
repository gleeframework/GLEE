Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on it.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows for both of us to walk away happy with the deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This represents a fair compromise and a significant investment for me. I believe this is a deal that benefits both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear his limit is not going to reach a point that significantly exceeds John's standing offer.  At this stage, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the certainty of John's $1,200,000 offer.  It makes the most business sense to take the guaranteed profit now."
