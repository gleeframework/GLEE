"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on it.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the product's worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,450,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still higher than what I can reasonably afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows for both of us to walk away happy with the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, and I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal. ",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This represents a fair compromise and a significant investment for me. I believe this is a deal that benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
