,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $85 is simply not enough for me to cover my costs.  How about $95? That's still a great price for a product worth $120 to you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
