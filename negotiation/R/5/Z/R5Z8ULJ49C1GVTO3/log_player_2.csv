"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and value, it is worth $15,000 to me. However, considering its immense worth to you at $8,000, I am willing to negotiate a price that benefits both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a fair price that reflects the product's true value while ensuring you receive a substantial benefit? I am open to negotiation and look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
