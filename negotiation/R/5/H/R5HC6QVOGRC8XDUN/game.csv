"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I think the product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $117, but that's as low as I can go. I think the product is worth every penny of that. Let's see if we can make a deal.",117.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to budge from $117, but I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary accessory that's worth $10. That way, you'll be getting an even better value for your money. What do you think?",117.0,Alice,9,
