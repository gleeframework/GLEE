"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but $800,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet at $950,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm willing to move a bit closer to your number. Would $1,000,000 work for you?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
