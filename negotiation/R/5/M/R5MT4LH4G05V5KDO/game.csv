"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  The value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1200000. This is a fair price that reflects the unique benefits of my product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still beyond my price point. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer $1000000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while staying within my budget. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
