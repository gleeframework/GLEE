"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1,000,000 to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000.  This is still a significant value for you, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal, but $975,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  Let's keep moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $1,025,000? This offer is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you and represents a fair compromise. ",1025000.0,Alice,5,
