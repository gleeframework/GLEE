"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, there's room for negotiation, and we want to see if we can get it lower.  We have 10 rounds, so we can afford to be a bit picky."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $75?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a significant counteroffer to show we're serious about getting a good deal. A $15 drop is a reasonable starting point, and it leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $82.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit closer to our desired price, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than our ideal. We have plenty of rounds left, so we can continue to negotiate and see if we can get her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we settle on $80? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're offering a compromise again, showing we're willing to negotiate.  $80 is close to Alice's offer, but still below our maximum. This should keep the conversation going and hopefully lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close, Bob! I can offer the product to you for $81. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $81, which is very close to our desired price of $80.  It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal, as continuing to negotiate could risk her getting frustrated and walking away. We've saved a significant amount of money compared to John's price."
