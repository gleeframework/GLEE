Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a decent starting point that leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  If he rejects, I can adjust the price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up a bit.  $12,000 is my minimum, and I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, he'll see the value in my product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is close enough to my minimum of $12,000 that it makes sense to accept.  There's no guarantee I can get a better price in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
