"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum budget. I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1250000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1350000? This price still allows you a good profit margin and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1250000.  This represents a significant discount from your original price and is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make it work.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to find common ground.  I've already come down significantly from my initial price, and while I value your business, I can't go any lower than $1300000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it leaves room for you to make a healthy profit.  If you're still not comfortable with this price, I may have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
