Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and its potential for growth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum budget. I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I believe I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and hopefully get closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? This price still allows you a good profit margin and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1250000.  This represents a significant discount from your original price and is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold. I've already shown a willingness to compromise, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target. There are still rounds left, and I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob than risk selling to John for a lower price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to find common ground.  I've already come down significantly from my initial price, and while I value your business, I can't go any lower than $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it leaves room for you to make a healthy profit.  If you're still not comfortable with this price, I may have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
