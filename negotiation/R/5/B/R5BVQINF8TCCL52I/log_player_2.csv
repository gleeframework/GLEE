"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. After careful consideration, we have decided to offer it to you for $950,000. We believe this price reflects the value of the product and we hope it aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $950,000 is still above his budget, and he has room to negotiate. He can try to get a better price from Alice or, if unsuccessful, purchase from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, due to the exclusivity and high demand for our product, we cannot accept your offer of $850,000. Our minimum acceptable price remains at $950,000. I would like to suggest a compromise at $900,000, which still reflects the value we place on the product while being more accommodating to your budget.

While Alice's compromise to $900,000 is getting closer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate further. He's still in a good position to either negotiate with Alice or purchase from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Bob. Considering the value of our product and your willingness to negotiate, I am prepared to consider a price of $887,500. This price reflects a compromise between our original offers and I believe it provides a fair value for both parties involved.

While Alice's offer of $887,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he wants to pay. Bob is better off rejecting this offer and seeing if he can negotiate a lower price.  He still has the option to buy from John for $800,000, so he's in a good position to continue negotiating."
