"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  While $130 is more than the product's worth to Alice ($100), it's still cheaper than buying from John ($150). Bob aims to save money, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that goal."
