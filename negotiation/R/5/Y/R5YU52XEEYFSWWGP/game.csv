"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $9500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $8750? I really want to get this product, and this price feels right to me.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to come down to $8900. This is a very fair price for both of us, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make. Let me know if you're interested.",8900.0,Alice,5,
