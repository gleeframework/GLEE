Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. This offer is still attractive to Bob, as it's less than his valuation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while acknowledging that Bob may counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum valuation.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm hoping for.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  I'm willing to walk away from this deal rather than risk further negotiations with Bob."
