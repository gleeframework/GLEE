"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $13,000, given its worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $15,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate or see if Alice will lower her price."
