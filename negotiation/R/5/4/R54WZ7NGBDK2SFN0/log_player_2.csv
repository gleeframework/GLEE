"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly above your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate and try to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but gives room for negotiation.  We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to your maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and risking losing the deal, especially since John offers the same price."
