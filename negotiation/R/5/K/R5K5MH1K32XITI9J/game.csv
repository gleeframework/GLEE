"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the value it holds for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000. This is a fair compromise and allows for some profit for you while remaining within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,500. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for my product, considering its value to me and the value it holds for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,750. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9750.0,Alice,5,
