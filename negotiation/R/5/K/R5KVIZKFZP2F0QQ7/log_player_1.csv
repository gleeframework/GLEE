"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible while still remaining attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a loss. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $16,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully closer to a price Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to offer $15,500.  This is a compromise, as it's above my minimum but still gives Bob a good deal.  I'm hoping he sees the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $14,800 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price. I'm concerned that we might not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $15,000."
