Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $12,000 might make Bob balk, pushing him towards rejecting the offer and forcing Alice to accept the $10,000 from John."
