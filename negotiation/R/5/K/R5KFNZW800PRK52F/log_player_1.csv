Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I know John will buy the product for $100, that's my fallback.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Starting High:** $150 is a significant markup, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Value Proposition:** My message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob, allowing him to potentially value it higher than $100.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation style, I might adjust my approach in subsequent messages."
