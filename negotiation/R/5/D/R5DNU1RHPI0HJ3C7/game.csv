"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of immense value to you.  It's something that I'm confident could significantly benefit your business.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product, but also allows for some flexibility.  I understand you may have other options, but I truly believe this product could be a game changer for you.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
