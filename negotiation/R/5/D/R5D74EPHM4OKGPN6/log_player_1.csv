Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. Would you be interested in paying $12,000 for it?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than what I could get from John. 
* The message is friendly and focuses on a fair deal, making Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* This strategy allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters, while still giving me a decent profit."
