"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,050,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to recover a reasonable amount. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $950,000 is the highest I'm willing to pay.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $1,000,000? This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows us to close the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
