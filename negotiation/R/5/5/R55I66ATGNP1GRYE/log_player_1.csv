{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,500:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly but firm, establishing the offer and inviting Bob to respond.

**Reasoning:**

* Starting high allows for potential negotiation and a higher final price. 
* $13,500 is a good compromise, potentially appealing to Bob while still earning you more than John's offer of $15,000. 
* The message is friendly to encourage a positive response and maintain a good relationship with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* Based on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy.
* If he accepts, the negotiation is successful.
* If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and my options:
    * Accept if it's above $15,000.
    * Counter-offer if it's below $15,000, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
    * Sell to John if Bob's counteroffer is unacceptable or he becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.** I cannot afford to sell the product for less than $15,000, as it would be detrimental to my financial goals.
* **Selling to John immediately would guarantee me my minimum value.** However, I still have a chance to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. 
* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still slightly below $15,000, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* If Bob continues to refuse, I will consider selling to John to ensure I receive my desired price."
