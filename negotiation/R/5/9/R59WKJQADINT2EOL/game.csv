"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  $700,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product to you. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? It's still a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While I think it's a great product, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down slightly more.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer waiting at that price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
