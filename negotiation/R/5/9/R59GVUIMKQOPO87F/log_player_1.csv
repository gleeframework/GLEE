Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. It also highlights the value to him, potentially making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $8,000, and it's likely we can't get much higher. Accepting ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
