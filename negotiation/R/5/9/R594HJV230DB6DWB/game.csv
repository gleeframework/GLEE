,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that you're willing to make a serious commitment. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but I think $11000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9500. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking that the product's value is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to come down to $10500, but I think that's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9800.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9800, Bob. However, I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9800 and $10500, which would be $10250. I'm willing to accept that as the lowest price I can sell it for. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10250. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make one final compromise and meet you at $10000. This is my absolute lowest price, and I'm hoping you'll be willing to meet me there. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, which is the lowest price I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,10,
