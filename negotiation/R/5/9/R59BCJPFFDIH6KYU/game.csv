"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $175 for it. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm only interested if the price is closer to $80.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? That still gives me some profit and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there yet. $125 is closer, but I'm really aiming for something closer to $100. I think that's a fair price considering both of our needs.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This would be a great price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while you get a great product at a good price.",110.0,Alice,5,
