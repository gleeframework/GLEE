Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,750,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by piquing Bob's interest, emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  Knowing the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000) and my own minimum ($1,500,000), I aim slightly higher to leave room for negotiation. The $1,750,000 price point allows for potential profit while staying within a justifiable range.
* **Confidence and Openness:**  Phrases like ""I'm confident"" and ""Let me know your thoughts"" project confidence in the product and encourage open communication.

While I have a guaranteed buyer in John, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is the priority."
