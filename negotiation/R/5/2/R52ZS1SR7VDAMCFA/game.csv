"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $120 to you. Considering its true worth, I propose a price of $180. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $180 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that price.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I must maintain the value of our product. I'm unable to accept $120 for it. I propose a compromise at $160, which still reflects the product's worth while being more accessible to your budget. Please let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $135 is a fair price that reflects the value of your product while staying within my budget.  Let's try to find common ground at this price.",135.0,Bob,4,
