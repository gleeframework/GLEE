"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That's still a great price for the value you'll get, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I really like the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
