Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm very interested in the product, though, and I'm willing to offer $1000000. This reflects my current budget and allows for some wiggle room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to consider your proposal.
