"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm very interested in the product, though, and I'm willing to offer $1000000. This reflects my current budget and allows for some wiggle room for negotiation. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I have to say that $1000000 is a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the best price I can offer at this point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
