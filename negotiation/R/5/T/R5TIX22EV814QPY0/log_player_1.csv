Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. 
* This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still leaving room for Bob to negotiate. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
