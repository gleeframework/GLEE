"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $10,750 is still a bit too low. Let's try $11,250. That's a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we settle this at $11,000 even? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,6,
