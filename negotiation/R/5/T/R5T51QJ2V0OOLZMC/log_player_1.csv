"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not where I want to be. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $105 is still too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal. I want to see if I can get a little closer to $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see what he counters with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I really appreciate your interest in the product. However, $110 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $108 is getting closer to my desired price, we are running out of rounds. I'm not confident I can get Bob to accept my offer, and it's important to me to get at least my minimum price. I'll sell the product to John for $150, as it's the safest option at this point."
