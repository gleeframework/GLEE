"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your desired price range. You should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. You can save $200,000 by getting a better deal, so it's worth putting in the effort to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you offering the product, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while to sell the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is still a good deal for you.  You can save $350,000 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate a bit lower, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John. It's wiser to accept the offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
