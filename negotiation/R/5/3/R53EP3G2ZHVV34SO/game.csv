"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product is worth $12,000 to you, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we meet in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $8,000 is too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. Considering your product's value to you, I think $9,000 is still slightly out of my budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've given this some more thought and am willing to consider $8,750 as a compromise. However, if we could meet somewhere around $8,600, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8600.0,Bob,6,
