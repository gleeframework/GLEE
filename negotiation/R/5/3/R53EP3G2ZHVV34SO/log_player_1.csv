Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product is worth $12,000 to you, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I want for the product. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $8,000 is too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. Considering your product's value to you, I think $9,000 is still slightly out of my budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. I'll try to get a bit closer to $9,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some more thought and am willing to consider $8,750 as a compromise. However, if we could meet somewhere around $8,600, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,600 is getting very close to my desired price, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
