"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product!  I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's common in negotiations to start with a higher price, leaving room for compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This price allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential budget. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $100 offer allows for some leeway in price reduction if necessary.
* **John as a safety net:** If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is an option:** I can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $80. I will need to consider how much I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $75 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $85. This gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within my range:**  $85 is within my minimum acceptable range and still allows for further negotiation. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price.
* **Framing it positively:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for both of us.
* **Keeping the pressure on:**  By offering a counteroffer, I'm signaling that I'm not ready to settle for $75.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale within my desired range.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess how much further I'm willing to lower my price, or if it's time to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $85 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further negotiation needed:** I'm not willing to go lower, and there's no point in continuing to negotiate if he's already at my minimum. 
* **Selling to John is the same price:** While I could sell to John for $80, there's no advantage to doing so at this point. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
