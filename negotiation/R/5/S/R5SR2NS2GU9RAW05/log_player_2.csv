Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is a good price for you, considering your maximum budget is $1,500,000.  Further negotiation might get you a slightly better price, but it's likely to be a small difference.  It's better to accept this offer and avoid the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation dragging on."
