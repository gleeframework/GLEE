"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet halfway. I'll come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my reach.  To find common ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a substantial offer, it doesn't fully reflect the product's value proposition.  To move towards a win-win, I propose $1,650,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and shows my commitment to closing this deal. ",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal.  Your offer is attractive, but to be fair to both of us, I can't go below $1,450,000. This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.  I believe this is a very competitive offer, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
