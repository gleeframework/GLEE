"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet halfway. I'll come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my reach.  To find common ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly lower than John's offer. We have room to negotiate and try to get closer to at least $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a substantial offer, it doesn't fully reflect the product's value proposition.  To move towards a win-win, I propose $1,650,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and shows my commitment to closing this deal. "",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to John's offer, but it's still worth pushing Bob a bit further. We'll aim for a price closer to $1,400,000 in the next round."
