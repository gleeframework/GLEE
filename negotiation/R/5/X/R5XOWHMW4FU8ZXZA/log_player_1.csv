"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its worth to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,000,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You've left a $200,000 margin for Bob to negotiate, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **It demonstrates your confidence:** A high initial offer shows you believe in the value of your product.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects your offer, you can lower it slightly in the next round, but try to stay above your minimum value. You also have the option of switching to John if negotiations with Bob become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still within the negotiation range. We want to see if we can get closer to our target. Rejecting this offer will allow us to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to come down a little. However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It's lower than your initial offer but still above Bob's offer.
* **Offers a compelling reason:** You explain why you need to stick to a higher price, making it less likely for Bob to perceive it as arbitrary.
* **Maintains your negotiation power:** It shows you are willing to negotiate but not willing to sell for a price that's significantly below your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider selling it to me for $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is a good deal. It's significantly above our minimum of $800,000 and closer to our initial target of $1,000,000.  It's also a good compromise, meeting us halfway from our last offer. We've already rejected his offer twice, and continuing to negotiate may risk him backing out entirely.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
