"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to consider purchasing this product for $1,050,000.  This price is fair and allows for a healthy profit for you while still being within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This price still gives me a significant profit, but also takes into account your budget constraints.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This offer is fair, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to pass up.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
