Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and I'm confident we can agree on a price that benefits us both.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and the unique benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start with a significantly higher price to maximize your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""true value"" and ""unique benefits"" to justify the high price, even though Bob values it at $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the initial price, you can lower it while still aiming for a price higher than John's offer.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure the highest possible profit** if Bob accepts the initial offer or a negotiated price above $1,000,000.
2. **Maintain the option to sell to John** at your minimum acceptable price if Bob rejects the offer."
