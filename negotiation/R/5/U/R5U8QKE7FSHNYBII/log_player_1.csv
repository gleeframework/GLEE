Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide if you want to go lower, knowing your minimum is covered.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** A higher initial offer helps gauge Bob's seriousness. If he flat-out rejects it, you haven't lost anything.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have significant time constraints or other reasons to prioritize a quick sale."
