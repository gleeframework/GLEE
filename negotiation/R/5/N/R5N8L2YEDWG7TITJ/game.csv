"Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $90 right now.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. How about we meet at $102.50?",102.5,Alice,5,
