"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $95 yet. I'm willing to come down to $105, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
