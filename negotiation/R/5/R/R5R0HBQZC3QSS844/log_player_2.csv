"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value you place on it is $15,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum of $15,000, you can likely get a better deal.  There's room to negotiate down from $12,000."
