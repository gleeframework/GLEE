"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $10,800 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach an agreement.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need at least $11,200 to make this worthwhile. It's a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $11,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
