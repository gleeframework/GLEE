"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. However, I'm also willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. Would you be interested in discussing further?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both place on it. I believe it's a win-win scenario.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
