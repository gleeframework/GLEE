{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. I'm getting close to my minimum price, and there's a risk that we'll continue to negotiate and I'll end up with a worse deal. Selling to John for $10,000 would be a loss, so it's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
