Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $20,000 as my initial offer, aiming for a higher price. It's important to note that this is a risky move, as Bob might immediately reject it.  However, it leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a higher price. 

Here's why this is a good starting strategy:

* **Sets a high bar:**  A high initial offer establishes your perceived value of the product and gives you more room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Encourages counteroffers:** A high price is likely to prompt Bob to counteroffer, allowing you to gauge his interest and potential price range.
* **Provides leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives you a safety net and allows you to potentially walk away from the deal if Bob's counteroffers are too low.

Remember, this is just the first step.  The key is to be adaptable and willing to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Since Bob's offer matches John's offer of $15,000, it's best to accept Bob's offer. There's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob, as he's unlikely to go higher."
