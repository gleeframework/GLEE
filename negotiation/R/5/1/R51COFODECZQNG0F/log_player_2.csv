"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting price is closer to your maximum budget than it is to her minimum selling point. There's room for negotiation here to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $140 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price ($110 vs. $140). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:** My goal is to pay as little as possible while still making it worthwhile for Alice to sell. $110 gives me a significant saving while still being above Alice's minimum price.
* **Polite and Positive:** Maintaining a friendly and appreciative tone throughout the negotiation is important for a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice met me halfway between our previous offers. This is a strong indication she's willing to make a deal.
* **Significant Savings:** $125 is a $25 saving compared to John's offer and a reasonable price for me. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Further negotiation could lead to an impasse, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure a good deal now."
