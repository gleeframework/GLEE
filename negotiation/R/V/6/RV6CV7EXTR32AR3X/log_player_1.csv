Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is more than $10,000, so Bob might be inclined to accept.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $12,000 is less than your minimum of $15,000, so you still have room to negotiate.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can see if Bob is willing to pay closer to your value. If he rejects, you can then lower the price a bit, or even accept his counteroffer if it's close enough to your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below your minimum of $15,000 and even below your initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** You can still potentially get a better price from Bob. 
* **Opportunity cost:** While selling to John for $15,000 is guaranteed, you might be able to get closer to that price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your target value and see if you can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you are willing to negotiate but still maintain a price above your minimum. 
* **Reasoning:** You provide a reason for the price, emphasizing the value of the product to justify your stance. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains polite and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation open. 

This counteroffer balances your desire to get a better price with the risk of losing the deal to John. It keeps the negotiation moving while still giving you some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $10,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $10,000 is very close to your minimum price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing John:** If you reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further, you risk losing John, who is willing to pay your full asking price. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing the negotiation could take more time and might not yield a significantly better result.

While $10,000 is not your ideal price, it's a good deal considering the potential risks of further negotiation. Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal quickly and minimize the risk of losing both potential buyers."
