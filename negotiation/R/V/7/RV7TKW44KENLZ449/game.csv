"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we negotiate, I'd like to start with an offer of $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our conversation.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $950000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your willingness to make a serious offer.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $825000. This is the maximum I can stretch to, and I hope we can agree on this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
