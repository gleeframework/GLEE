Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives me a decent profit margin, while still being a fair starting point for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate since he values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer of $160 is a reasonable compromise. While I'd prefer to sell for more, accepting his offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
