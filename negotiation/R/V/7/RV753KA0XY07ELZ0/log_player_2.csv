"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Bob is aiming to get a good deal, so he's starting with a price that's closer to Alice's minimum (likely) value of $12,000.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Positive tone:** Bob keeps the communication friendly, making Alice more likely to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $14,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal.  
* **Negotiation space:**  There's still room to negotiate, and Bob wants to avoid paying more than he has to. 
* **Time to counter:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm still very interested in the product.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway. 
* **Fair price:** Bob believes this price is reasonable, leaving some profit for Alice while still being within his budget.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice is offering a compromise, $14,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay at this point. He's already made a counteroffer close to this amount and is hoping for a better price. 
* **Negotiation still possible:** Bob has several rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob the opportunity to potentially get a lower price. 
* **Avoiding Jhon:** While buying from Jhon is an option, Bob is determined to save as much money as possible. He's committed to trying to negotiate a better deal with Alice before resorting to Jhon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a good deal.  I'm willing to go up to $13,750.  This is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy.  Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint approach:** Bob is offering the midpoint between his previous offer ($13,500) and Alice's current offer ($14,000). This shows he's willing to meet in the middle.
* **Final push:** This counteroffer could be Bob's last attempt to get a price closer to his desired amount.
* **Positive and enthusiastic tone:**  The message is encouraging and optimistic, hoping to persuade Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $14,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  Bob has only 3 rounds left, and Alice is showing signs of being firm.
* **Close to the limit:**  While $14,250 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  With limited rounds left, Bob risks getting stuck in a stalemate if he continues to counter.  
* **Safe bet:**  Buying from Jhon at $15,000 guarantees the purchase and ensures Bob doesn't lose out on a valuable product. 

While Bob wants the best deal, he also wants to secure the product.  In this situation, purchasing from Jhon is the most practical and safe option."
