"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

Reason: Bob is trying to start the negotiation by making a significant counteroffer, which is $5,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal. This also leaves room for potential compromises in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice has lowered her price, but it is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price, as he still has several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $14,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

Reason: Bob is making a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's offer, showing he is willing to compromise. However, he's staying below his maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm still not comfortable with $14500. How about we meet in the middle at $15250? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason:  Alice's offer of $15,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. While there is a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk is too high that he will run out of rounds and be forced to accept a price he is not comfortable with. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget."
