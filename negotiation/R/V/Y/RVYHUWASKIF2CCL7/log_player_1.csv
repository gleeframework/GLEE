{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to budge. I'm also trying to be friendly and build a rapport to increase the chances of a successful negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy and potentially lower the price further, but I want to see if he's willing to pay more first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept such a low price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm aiming for a price in the middle of our two initial offers.  This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give away too much.  I'm also emphasizing that it's still a good deal for him to incentivize his acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for countering. I'm trying to keep my budget below $10,000.  Would you do $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000, so I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer.  The risk of selling to John for $12,000 is always present, but I want to see if I can get Bob to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000.  How about $10,250? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm trying to be firm but fair by sticking to my minimum while also showing flexibility with a small reduction from my previous offer. I'm hoping this will convince Bob that a deal is within reach and encourage him to accept."
