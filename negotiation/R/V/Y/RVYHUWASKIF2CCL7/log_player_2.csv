Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000.  How about $10,250? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

At this point, Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $10,000.  It's not worth further negotiation since you have a guaranteed offer for $10,000 from John."
