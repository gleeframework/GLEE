"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible price, and starting with a counteroffer of $850,000 is a reasonable first step. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $950,000, but still above Alice's value of $800,000. This leaves room for further negotiation while maintaining a strong starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. While it's still lower than John's price, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get the price lower by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price closer to his target of $800,000.  A counteroffer of $900,000 is a reasonable middle ground between Alice's offer of $975,000 and Bob's previous offer of $850,000. This keeps the negotiation moving while still giving Bob a good chance of securing a favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $985,000 is getting closer to John's price of $1,200,000.  It's not clear if further negotiation will get Alice to a price Bob is happy with. Given the possibility that the negotiations could continue for a while without reaching a desired price, it's more advantageous for Bob to simply buy the product from John.  While it's not the lowest price, it's a guaranteed deal and prevents the risk of continuing negotiations that could ultimately lead to a worse outcome."
