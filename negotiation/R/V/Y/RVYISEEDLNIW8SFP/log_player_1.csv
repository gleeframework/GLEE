**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's beneficial for me.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
