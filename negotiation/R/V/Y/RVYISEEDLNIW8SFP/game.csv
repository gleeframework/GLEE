"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer at $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your constraints, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would still be a significant discount from my initial asking price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,025,000 is still above my budget, I am willing to consider a price closer to $975,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're able to offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I can't go as low as $975,000.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
