"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. This price is higher than my minimum, giving me some wiggle room to adjust if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not yet willing to settle for that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm still not willing to sell for $75.  I'll counteroffer again and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $85. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum and closer to Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher than $78, and I'm running out of time.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
