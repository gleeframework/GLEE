"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would you consider coming down to $120?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $140. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me. I'm still trying to stay within my budget and $140 is a bit too high. How about we split the difference and go with $130? I think this would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'd be happy with the product.",130.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $130. I'm willing to offer $135, which is still a great deal and a fair price for the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,7,
