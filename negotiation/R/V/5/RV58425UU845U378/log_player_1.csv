Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price from him or from John. I want to try and push Bob higher than his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This gives us both a fair deal, and I'm confident the product will be well worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I've considered your offer, but I still believe $10,000 is the most I can afford. I'd like to stick to that if possible. I hope this helps move us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to run out of time, I'm still not willing to sell for his price. I think I can get him to go a bit higher, and I'm hoping to avoid selling to John for the lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,500.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
