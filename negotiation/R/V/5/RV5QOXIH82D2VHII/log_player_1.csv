"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a significant discount for Bob (worth $500 to him) but still allows me to make a good profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counter-offering with $8,500. This is still a good deal for Bob (worth $1,500 to him), and it's only $500 below my desired price. I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize him to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
