"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal!  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.  Alice is offering it for $150.  You can get the same product from John for $150.  

Since you're looking to save money and both options have the same price, you'll reject Alice's offer. You will then proceed to buy the product from John."
