"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a lower offer of $700000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
