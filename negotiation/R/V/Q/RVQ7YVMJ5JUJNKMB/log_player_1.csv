Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the true value of this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit concerned about the cost. Would you be willing to meet me at $1150000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to a potential deal, $1,150,000 is still too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I need to make sure I get at least a reasonable amount for this product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the cost. Would you be willing to meet me at $1075000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob's offers are getting increasingly low, and it's clear he's not willing to meet me in the middle.  While I'd like to get more, it's better to secure a guaranteed sale at this point rather than risk further negotiation that may result in an even lower price."
