Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $149 is a strong starting point. It's just below your guaranteed price, maximizing potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** By highlighting it as a ""great deal,"" you subtly nudge Bob towards accepting.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price while considering the fallback option of selling to John."
