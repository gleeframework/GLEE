"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $10,000, and John is offering the product at that price, it's the most logical choice. There's no point in negotiating with Alice if you can secure the product at your budget limit immediately."
