"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your valuation of the product at $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, I'm still finding it a bit high.  Could we settle at $10,000? It's my top price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,000 as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
