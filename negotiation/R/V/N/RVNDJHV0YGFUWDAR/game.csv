"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I really believe this product is worth more to you than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, I still need to make a profit, and $14,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's try $15,500. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, while also allowing me to make a decent profit.",15500.0,Alice,5,
