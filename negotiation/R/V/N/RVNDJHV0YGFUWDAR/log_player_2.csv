"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

$18,000 is way too high for Bob. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I really believe this product is worth more to you than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$16,000 is still above Bob's budget, but it's closer.  Bob should continue to negotiate, trying to get the price closer to his $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, I still need to make a profit, and $14,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's try $15,500. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, while also allowing me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been trying to negotiate, but Alice is unwilling to go lower than $15,500. This is still above Bob's limit of $12,000.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
