Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point as it's more than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is more than the product is worth to Bob, it's still less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $100. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my previous offer of $110 and his offer of $90.  I believe this price is fair and will hopefully lead to a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than my minimum of $120.  It's best to go with the guaranteed $120 from John and avoid further negotiation."
