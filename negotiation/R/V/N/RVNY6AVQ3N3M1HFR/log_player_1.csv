Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and the information about Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down a bit, potentially still landing Alice a better deal than John's offer.
* **Create a Sense of Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth and positions the offer as a considered decision, not just a random number.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might want to start even higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If Alice is on a tight deadline, she might be more inclined to offer a lower price to ensure a quick sale."
