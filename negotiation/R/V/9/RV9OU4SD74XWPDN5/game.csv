"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,000,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,150,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and still leaves some room for negotiation.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,075,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  $1,075,000 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,100,000?  That seems like a fair price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
