"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I've personally valued at no less than $1,000,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I believe is fair and mutually beneficial.  I'm asking $1,150,000 for it.  This price gives you a significant return on your investment while still allowing me to achieve my desired financial outcome.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
