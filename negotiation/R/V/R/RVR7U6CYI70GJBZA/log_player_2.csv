"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice's offer is exactly that amount, there's no room for negotiation or saving money.  Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob can still get the product from John for the same price.  This doesn't save Bob any money, but it keeps his options open in case a better deal comes along."
