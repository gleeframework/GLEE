**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have valuable information: Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to his valuation as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John provides a safety net. You're guaranteed at least $800,000.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of urgency and making Bob feel like he's getting a special deal can encourage a quicker decision.

**The offer of $925,000:**

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, but you're still well above your minimum.
* **Substantial profit for Bob:**  He stands to gain $75,000 in perceived value if he accepts.

This strategy aims to secure a deal that's highly beneficial for you while still enticing enough for Bob to accept."
