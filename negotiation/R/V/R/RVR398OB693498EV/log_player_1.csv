"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This will allow me some room to negotiate while still making a profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price, as he values the product at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to try and counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. I have plenty of rounds left and I can still sell to John if I have to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob, as he's likely to want the product and it's still a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a little lower than my ideal price, it's a decent profit and it would be a waste of time to continue negotiating.  It's also important to avoid getting too greedy and potentially losing the sale altogether."
