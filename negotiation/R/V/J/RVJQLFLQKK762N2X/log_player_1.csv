"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's perspective, which can help build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe there's room for further negotiation, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,500.  This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,250 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $10,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $9,400? It's a small step closer to my desired price and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,000. How about we try to find a compromise at $9,100? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and $9,400. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation with Bob has stalled, and we've reached a point where the price is unlikely to move significantly higher. My minimum acceptable price is $12,000, and I'm not comfortable selling for less than that.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum, it's in my best interest to sell to John and guarantee a good deal."
