"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,500.  This gives us both a fair deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $9,400? It's a small step closer to my desired price and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,000. How about we try to find a compromise at $9,100? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and $9,400.",9100.0,Bob,6,
