"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. I would like to propose an offer closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about we consider $1400000 for the product?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1450000. This would allow us to both benefit from the deal. Let's try to find a compromise here.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
