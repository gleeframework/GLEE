"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us to reach a fair agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value you'll gain from owning this asset.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
