Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
