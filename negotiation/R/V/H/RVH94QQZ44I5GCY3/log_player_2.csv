"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still a significant amount above your ideal price. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** There are 9 more rounds, giving you ample opportunity to lower the price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** While you'd prefer a lower price, buying from John is a guaranteed way to secure the product within your budget if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us to reach a fair agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value you'll gain from owning this asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a decrease from the previous round, you're still aiming for a lower price closer to $800,000.
* **You still have time to negotiate.** With 7 rounds left, you have more opportunities to lower the price.
* **John is still a viable backup.**  If negotiations stall, you can always purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your target.** $850,000 is only $50,000 away from your ideal price.
* **You're running out of time.** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice and having to buy from John for a higher price increases.
* **Accepting this offer is a good compromise.** It allows you to secure the product for a price that is within your budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
