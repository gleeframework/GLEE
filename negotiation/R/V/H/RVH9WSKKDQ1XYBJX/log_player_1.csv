Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 is a strong starting point. This price is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), giving us room for negotiation if needed.
    *  Close enough to John's offer ($15,000) that we aren't losing out on a significant amount if Bob accepts.

**Important Note:** This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest. Depending on his response, we may need to adjust our approach in further negotiations."
