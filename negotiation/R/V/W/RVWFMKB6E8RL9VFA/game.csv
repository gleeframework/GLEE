"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is significantly below what I'm able to accept.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a chance to make a reasonable profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,500? That would work for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
