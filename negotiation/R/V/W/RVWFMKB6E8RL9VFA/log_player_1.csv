"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a positive relationship with Bob by emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is significantly below what I'm able to accept.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a chance to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,500? That would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
