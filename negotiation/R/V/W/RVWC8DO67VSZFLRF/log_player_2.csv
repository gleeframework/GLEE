Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $950,000 or higher. I can offer you the product for $925,500. That's the best I can do, considering the value it brings. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $925,000 mark.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's getting risky, and a difference of $25,500 isn't worth potentially losing the deal and having to go with John at $1,500,000.  This offer is a good compromise and saves a significant amount compared to John's price."
