"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the pitch, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to buy it for $850,000.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. How about we split the difference and call it $925,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $950,000 or higher. I can offer you the product for $925,500. That's the best I can do, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",925500.0,Alice,7,
