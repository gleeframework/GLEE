{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice.  There's a good chance you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very aggressive counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to budge.  I'm aiming for a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer, but still a potential win for her if she's desperate to sell. This gives us room to negotiate upward if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than what I'd like to pay, and it's still significantly lower than John's price.  I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can push her lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates good faith and hopefully encourages Alice to come down a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now closer to my desired price point.  While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of her, the risk of continuing to negotiate is that she might get frustrated and walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price, saving a significant amount of money compared to John."
