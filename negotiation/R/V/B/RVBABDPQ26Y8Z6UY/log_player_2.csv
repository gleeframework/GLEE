"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $135 is lower than her value, you can get the product for a better price ($120) from John.  You're better off going with the guaranteed lower price."
