"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? I think that's fair considering the value of this product.",132.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $128.75. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to make a deal.",128.75,Bob,4,
