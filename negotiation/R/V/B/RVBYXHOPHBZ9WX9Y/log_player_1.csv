Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth accepting or if I should try to get closer to my desired $150. If negotiations get too time-consuming, I'll simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop to his price yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? I think that's fair considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $128.75. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not sure if we'll ever reach an agreement.  It's taking too long to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get my desired price from John. It's time to move on and avoid further delays."
