"Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my research, I believe a fair price for this product would be $800,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true value and allows us both to have a successful transaction.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but I believe $800,000 undervalues some of the unique benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,400,000. This price reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's true value is recognized.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I believe a fair price that balances our needs is $1,000,000. This price recognizes the product's value while also allowing me to make the purchase. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a mutually beneficial outcome.  While $1,000,000 is a significant step in the right direction, I'm targeting a price closer to $1,300,000. This reflects the true value of this product and the benefits it will bring to your business. I'm confident we can find an agreement in that range.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm seeing progress in our negotiations.  $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still looking for a more agreeable price.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,100,000.  This price acknowledges the product's unique benefits while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
