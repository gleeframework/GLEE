"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is less than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $120, so there's room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between Alice's offer of $130 and my target price of $120. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my previous counteroffer, but it's still within my acceptable range. However, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my target price. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving up in price, but I'm staying firm. I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to compromise, but still aiming for a price closer to my target. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still a bit higher than my target price, but she's moving in the right direction. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get her down a little more before considering accepting. We have several rounds left, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $130, which is halfway between Alice's current offer of $132 and my target price of $120.  This shows a continued willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good deal.  We are getting closer, and I believe this counteroffer has a good chance of being accepted by Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $131
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $131, which is just $1 over my previous counteroffer and only $11 over my target price. This is a good deal, and we're getting very close to my desired price. It's likely that we will not be able to close the deal at a lower price with the remaining rounds. So, it's better to accept this offer and avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
