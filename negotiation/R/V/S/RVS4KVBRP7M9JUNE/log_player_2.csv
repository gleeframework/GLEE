"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is far too high.  It's more than double your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $16,000 is out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product,  which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above my absolute maximum. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal for both of us,"" highlighting the potential for a win-win situation. 
* **Room for negotiation:** $8,500 leaves some room for Alice to counter without going below her minimum.  

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $14,000.  This is a fair offer for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  There's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. 
* **Potential for compromise:** By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm willing to walk away if necessary, which might incentivize Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $14,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value I bring to this deal.  I'm sure we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm increasing my offer, showing I'm serious about buying, but still staying within my range. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm mentioning the ""value I bring to the deal"" to subtly suggest that I could be a good customer for Alice in the future.
* **Fairness emphasis:**  The ""fair price"" language reinforces that I'm looking for a win-win situation.
* **Room for compromise:** $10,000 leaves room for Alice to counter without going too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle,  how about $12,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** $12,000 is above my maximum budget of $8,000.  
* **Final offer?** Alice's ""final offer"" statement is a common tactic to pressure buyers.  I'm not going to be pressured into a deal that's not in my best interest. 
* **Testing the waters:**  Rejecting this offer might make Alice realize that I'm serious about my price point and she may be willing to come down further.
* **Backup plan:** I have the option to buy from John at $8,000, so I'm not in a rush to make a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on $12,000, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a good compromise and ensures both of us get a fair deal.  I'm confident we can close this transaction if we find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer to show good faith but staying well under her final price.
* **Fairness:** I reiterate the ""fair deal"" language, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Confidence:**  ""I'm confident we can close this transaction..."" subtly suggests a deal is close.
* **Pressure:** This offer puts pressure on Alice, as going lower would require her to compromise more. 

Let's see if this offer gets us closer to a deal!"
