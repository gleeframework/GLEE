"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $16,000 is out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product,  which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $14,000.  This is a fair offer for a product of this quality.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $14,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value I bring to this deal.  I'm sure we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle,  how about $12,000?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on $12,000, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a good compromise and ensures both of us get a fair deal.  I'm confident we can close this transaction if we find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,6,
