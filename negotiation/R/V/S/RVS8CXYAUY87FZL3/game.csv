"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,,
