"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $100 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You should always aim for the best possible price."
