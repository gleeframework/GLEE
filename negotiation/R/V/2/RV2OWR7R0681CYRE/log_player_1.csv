Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob. I'm hoping to capture some of that surplus value, but I'm not going too extreme. This should open the negotiation without immediately shutting him down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can push for a better deal.  I'm not quite ready to settle for $850,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $880,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully incentivizes him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my desired price than John's offer.  It's also a good indicator that Bob is serious about buying the product.  It's time to close the deal."
