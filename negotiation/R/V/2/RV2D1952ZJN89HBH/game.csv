"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a reasonable outcome.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can agree on that price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
