"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,600,000. It's a unique piece, and I believe it's worth more to you than anyone else.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer at a lower price.  Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
