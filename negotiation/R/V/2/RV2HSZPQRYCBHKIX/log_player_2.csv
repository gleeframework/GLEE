"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,600,000. It's a unique piece, and I believe it's worth more to you than anyone else.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer at a lower price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While the product might be unique, you can still get the same product from John for your maximum price. It's better to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
