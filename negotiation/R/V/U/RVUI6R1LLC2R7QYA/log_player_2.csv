Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $90.  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

Alice is unlikely to go below $90, and it's not worth risking further negotiation.  Buying from John for $80 guarantees you stay within budget and get the product."
