"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $50 for the product. Would you be willing to go that low?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $100? That's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you need to make a fair profit too. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a significant price difference for me, but I'm ready to buy if you agree.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $90.  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth it.",90.0,Alice,5,
