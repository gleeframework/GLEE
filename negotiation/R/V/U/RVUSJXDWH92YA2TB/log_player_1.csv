Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm confident that I can get at least $100 from John if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum value of $100.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell below my minimum price. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $95 to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. This price is still above my minimum value, but it's closer to Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm lowering my price again to $90. This is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still being above my minimum price point. Hopefully, Bob will find this offer more appealing."
