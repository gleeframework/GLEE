"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you, and a good start for me. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but let's aim for $1050000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit and ensuring you get a valuable product. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we try to find a compromise?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility and I see we're getting closer. However, $950000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's try to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
