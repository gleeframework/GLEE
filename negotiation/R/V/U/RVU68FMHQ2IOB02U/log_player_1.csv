Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop that low. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."

Bob's offer:

While I'm starting to get closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
