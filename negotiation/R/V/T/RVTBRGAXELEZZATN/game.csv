"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $11,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $12,000 just yet. I'm willing to offer you a slight concession and sell the product to you for $12,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",12750.0,Alice,5,
