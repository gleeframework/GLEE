"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we settle at $13,000? This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $13,000, so how about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
