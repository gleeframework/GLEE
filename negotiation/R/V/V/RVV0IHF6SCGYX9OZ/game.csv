"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $105? Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $107.50. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $108.50?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",108.5,Alice,5,
