"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum acceptable price. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product like this, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This would ensure a mutually beneficial deal and allow us both to walk away happy.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $975,000, which would be $987,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can we consider $987,500?",987500.0,Bob,4,
