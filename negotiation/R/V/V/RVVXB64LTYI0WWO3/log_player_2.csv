"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. This is an exceptional value considering its worth to you is also $120. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $120 to Bob and John is offering it for the same price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. Bob can get the product at the same price immediately from John."
