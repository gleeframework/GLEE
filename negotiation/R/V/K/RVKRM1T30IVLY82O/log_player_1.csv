This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a good deal while still leaving room for me to increase the price in later rounds. I've used a friendly tone to build rapport and emphasize the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum price of $100.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $117.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 117.50} 
``` 
 
I'm going to split the difference between my desired price ($130) and Bob's offer ($105). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my goal. The message emphasizes fairness and the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $110 is still below my minimum of $100. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm making a small concession to $115, which is still above my minimum price of $100. My message continues to emphasize the value of the product for Bob and highlights the good deal he's getting."
