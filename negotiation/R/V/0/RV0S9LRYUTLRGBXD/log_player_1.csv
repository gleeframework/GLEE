"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the proposed price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of room for negotiation and a guaranteed offer from John, so it's strategically better to reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $650,000 is quite a bit below its true value and what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but it's still a touch high for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob is moving closer to your acceptable range, you still have negotiating room and rounds available.  Accepting $725,000 would be a significant loss compared to John's offer.  It's worth making another counteroffer, but you should start to consider your walk-away point in case Bob doesn't budge much higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working to find a price that works. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial valuation. Would you be willing to agree to $800,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it represents my final offer."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Firmness:** It's time to signal to Bob that you're nearing your bottom line.  By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Meeting His Value:** Offering $800,000 matches what Bob values the product at. While you'd prefer more, it maximizes the chance of closing the deal with him and avoids the risk of him walking away.
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, it's a strong signal that he's not willing to meet your minimum acceptable price. You can then confidently walk away and take John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
