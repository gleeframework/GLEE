Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $650,000 is quite a bit below its true value and what I'm aiming for.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working to find a price that works. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial valuation. Would you be willing to agree to $800,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it represents my final offer.
