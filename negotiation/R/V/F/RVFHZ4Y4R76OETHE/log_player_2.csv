Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. $11,000 is still above his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John. He should try to negotiate a lower price, or move on to John."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Even though Alice has come down to $10,000, this is still above Bob's budget. John is offering the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget. It's the best deal for Bob at this point."
