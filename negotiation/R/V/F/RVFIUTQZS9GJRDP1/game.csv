,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, which means $101.25.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",101.25,Alice,5,
