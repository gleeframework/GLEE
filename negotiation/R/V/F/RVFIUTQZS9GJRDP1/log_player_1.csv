Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I'm not sure if $115 is the best deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90, which is $97.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $97.50 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal. I want to see if I can push a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, which means $101.25.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $101.25 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $97.50, which is $99.625. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99.62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99.62
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and it's clear he's not willing to budge much further.  It's getting risky to keep going. I've decided to sell to John for $100.  It's not ideal, but it's a guaranteed sale and I don't want to risk losing out on a deal altogether."
