"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still in the ballpark. I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still holding out for a significant profit. This counteroffer should signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not going to accept his lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give up a significant profit for the sake of a quick sale. I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000} 
```

I'm coming down to $1,275,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still leaves me with a decent profit.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while making it clear that I won't accept his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I have a few rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer.  It's in the middle ground between our last two offers.  I'm confident that this is the best I can do. If Bob rejects this, I'll move to sell to John."

Round 8

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $20,000 below my last counteroffer and we're running out of time. It's better to accept his offer and secure a sale than to risk losing out on a deal completely.  I'll take the $1,230,000."
