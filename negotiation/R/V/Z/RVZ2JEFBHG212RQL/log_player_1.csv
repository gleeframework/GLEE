Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is my opening offer. I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me. Bob might be hesitant, but this strategy gives me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100 for the product. I really like it, but I'm on a tight budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $130. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still protects my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's also right at the point where the product is worth more to him than to me.  Accepting his offer is the best option to maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation."
