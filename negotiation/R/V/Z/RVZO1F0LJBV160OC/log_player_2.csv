# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's $200,000 more than you're willing to pay, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the value she places on the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's more advantageous for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000, saving $200,000."
