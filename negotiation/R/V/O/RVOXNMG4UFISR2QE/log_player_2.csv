**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget and John's price, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of the product ($1,200,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, which could lead to her proposing a lower price."
