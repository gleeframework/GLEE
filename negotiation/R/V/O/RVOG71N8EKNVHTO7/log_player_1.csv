Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its worth.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000. Therefore, any offer to Bob should aim for a price higher than this.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob, while still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing Alice's minimum acceptable amount. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with ""What are your thoughts?"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just giving a yes or no answer."
