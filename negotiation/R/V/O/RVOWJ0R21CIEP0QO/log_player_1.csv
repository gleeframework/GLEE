Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm open to negotiation, creating an opportunity for Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Next steps:** 

I will observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly:

* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved a good price.
* **If Bob rejects and makes a counteroffer:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* **If Bob rejects and doesn't make a counteroffer:**  I'll consider selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price. 
* **John is a backup option:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob. 

**Next steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a middle ground to make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price closer to his initial offer but still significantly higher than his initial counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, justifying my counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** We've reached an agreement.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject it.
* **If Bob rejects and doesn't make a new offer:** I'll consider selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $900,000?  That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** $900,000 is still below my ideal price but close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Significant move:**  Bob's offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob backing out entirely, or his offer might become even lower.

**Next steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale for $900,000. This is a good outcome considering the potential risks of further negotiation and the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
