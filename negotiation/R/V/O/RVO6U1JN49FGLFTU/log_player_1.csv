Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves significant room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this is a fair starting point that allows for a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still do better.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering $975,000. This is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's slightly less than my preferred price, it's still a good deal for me, and the risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a stalemate.  It's important to recognize that there's always a possibility of a better offer in the future, but the opportunity cost of waiting might be greater than the potential gain."
