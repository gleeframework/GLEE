"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I think you're still a bit off the mark. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $11500 for this product. It's a one-of-a-kind item, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's meet in the middle, but not below $11500.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $12000. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the product's true value, and I'm not willing to give up on that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $11500 again, but I'm not budging below that.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but if we can't agree on a price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere. I really like this product, but I need to be smart about my budget. Can we meet at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're feeling frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on the value of this product. I'm willing to make one final offer: $12000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer, and I'm confident you'll find it fair.",12000.0,Alice,9,
