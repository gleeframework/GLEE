"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be high, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1000000 or less. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to this amount?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $1000000, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $1250000? This would still be a significant gain for you and would allow me to continue negotiating with you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
