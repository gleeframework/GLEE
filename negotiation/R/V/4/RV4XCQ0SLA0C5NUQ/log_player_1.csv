{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a good balance between maximizing my profit and leaving room for negotiation. I'm offering the product at a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm confident that Bob genuinely values the product and is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 just doesn't quite work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  This price still represents a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. Can we meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and it seems like Bob is firm on his budget.  It's in my best interest to accept his offer and secure the sale."
