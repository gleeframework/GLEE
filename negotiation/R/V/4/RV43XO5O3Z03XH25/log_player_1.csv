Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you're guaranteed a sale at your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly anchor Bob's perception to a higher price point. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects $19,000, you can gradually lower the price during the negotiation process while still aiming to stay above your $12,000 minimum."
