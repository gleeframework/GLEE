"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1000000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm willing to make a concession to get us started. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $950000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000. What do you think?",920000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $920000. I'm willing to make another small concession to get us closer to a deal. I'm proposing a price of $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.
