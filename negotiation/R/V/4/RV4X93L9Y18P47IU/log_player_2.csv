"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $900,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to go lower than $900,000 since her floor is $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than his alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be left with the more expensive option of buying from John."
