"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It demonstrates my willingness to buy the product, but also my commitment to getting the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000, which reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and only $200,000 more than what Bob could buy it from John for.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or make a counteroffer that is too high. Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product at a good price and avoid any further risk."
