Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still lower than my minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping a positive and encouraging tone to hopefully foster a productive negotiation.

**Next Steps:** 

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer myself. 
* If negotiations drag on or become unproductive, I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room for negotiation.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll need to balance getting a better price with the risk of Bob walking away completely.  I'll also continue to monitor the potential deal with John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000, which reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from $1,300,000 to $1,200,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Value:** I'm emphasizing that $1,200,000 is a fair price, reflecting the product's value and allowing for both of us to benefit.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm framing the offer as a ""meet in the middle"" approach, making it seem more appealing and likely to be accepted.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* If he rejects it, I'll reassess my options:
    * **Make another counteroffer:** I may be willing to lower my price slightly more, but I'll keep in mind my minimum acceptable price.
    * **Sell to John:** If Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low, I'll consider selling to John for my minimum price."
