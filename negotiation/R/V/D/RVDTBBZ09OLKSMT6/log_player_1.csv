Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range in the next round. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,100,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is closer, but still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see you're serious about getting this product.  While I'm willing to be flexible,  $1,125,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,162,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1162500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  How about we settle right at the midpoint of our last two offers - $1,143,750?  That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,143,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,143,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,143,750 is very close to my desired price. It's also significantly more than what I would get by selling to John. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
