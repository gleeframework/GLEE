"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,100,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is closer, but still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see you're serious about getting this product.  While I'm willing to be flexible,  $1,125,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,162,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1162500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  How about we settle right at the midpoint of our last two offers - $1,143,750?  That seems like a fair compromise.",1143750.0,Bob,6,
