Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Unknown Value:** Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for a price that's potentially high but not so high it immediately eliminates him as a buyer.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup option at $15,000 gives me a floor for my negotiations. I can always walk away if Bob's offers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $20,000.  $18,000 is still a good deal, but I believe there's room for further negotiation.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, and his price is closer to my desired range. This means there's likely more room for compromise.
* **Avoiding Loss:** While $15,000 from John is a guaranteed sale, I'm not in a rush and believe I can likely get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $20,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $18,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  By offering $19,000, I'm testing if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle. If he accepts, it's a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his true upper limit.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still holding onto the option of selling to John for $15,000, giving me a fallback if Bob's offers fall below my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is now only $500 below my previous offer of $18,000, indicating he's likely close to his upper limit.
* **Reasonable Price:** $17,500 is a good deal for me, especially considering my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to Bob walking away, leaving me with only the $15,000 option from John.

**Conclusion:**  It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale that's close to my desired price range."
