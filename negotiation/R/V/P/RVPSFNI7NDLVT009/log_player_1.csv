Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the Worth:** I, as Alice, know Bob values the product at $8,000 and John provides a guaranteed $8,000 backup. This means I should aim higher than $8,000.
* **First Offer Boldness:** Starting with a strong offer of $10,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  
* **Clear Communication:** The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach emphasizes the offer's seriousness and may prompt a quicker decision from Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims high. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, it maximizes potential profit if successful."
