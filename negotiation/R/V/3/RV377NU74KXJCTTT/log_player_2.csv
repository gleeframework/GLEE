"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($80).  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering $100, which is still more than the product is worth to Alice, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but is also willing to compromise.  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still within Bob's budget ($150).** 
* **It's lower than Bob's initial counteroffer.** This suggests Alice is willing to compromise.
* **Buying from John would cost Bob more.**  

While Bob might want to push for a lower price, accepting the offer at $130 is a reasonable compromise and saves Bob money compared to buying from John."
