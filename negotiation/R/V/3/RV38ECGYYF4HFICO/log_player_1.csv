"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. Would you be interested in paying $95 for it?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $80. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. While $82.50 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $75 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $78.75?  That would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 78.75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer a bit to meet you halfway. How about $77? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to push for a higher price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting $77 is still a decent profit and ensures I don't lose out by selling to John for $80."
