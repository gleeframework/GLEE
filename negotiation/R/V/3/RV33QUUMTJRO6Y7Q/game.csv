"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you and leaves room for us to make a deal.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet halfway. While I'm close to reaching a deal, $1,050,000 is still slightly below my target.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,075,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but no higher. Can we meet at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
