Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Offering a ""good deal"":** Framing the offer as a ""great price"" encourages Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not immediately going for my minimum, leaving room for counteroffers and a back-and-forth negotiation process.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and also considerably lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unattractive, it demonstrates his interest in the product. There's still potential for negotiation to reach a more favorable price. 

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you and leaves room for us to make a deal.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, suggesting that $1,100,000 is still a good deal.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to maintain a constructive dialogue and encourage Bob to accept.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I've secured a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for higher price:**  There's still room for negotiation to reach a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired amount. 
* **Not desperate:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a subpar offer.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make another counteroffer, likely somewhere between $1,050,000 and $1,100,000, aiming to find a compromise while still getting a decent price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet halfway. While I'm close to reaching a deal, $1,050,000 is still slightly below my target.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,075,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to reach a compromise while still maximizing my profit.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that this is a fair price for the benefit he'll receive.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  I'm using phrases like ""close this deal"" to subtly encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider whether to make another counteroffer or simply move on to John and secure my minimum desired price."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has been persistent with his offer of $1,050,000, and it seems unlikely he will budge further.

* **Guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Next steps:**

*  I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to secure my desired price."
