"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and I think you'd really appreciate it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $12,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$11,000 is a good price, saving you $4,000 compared to John's offer. It's worth accepting."
