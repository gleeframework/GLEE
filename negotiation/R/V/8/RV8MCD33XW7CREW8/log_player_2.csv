You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  You can offer a counteroffer closer to your desired $10,000 price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find a middle ground.

While Alice has come down a bit, it's still above your ideal price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to $10,000."
