Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:**  He'll still get a good deal, as the product is worth $80 to him.
* **It's lower than your ""fallback"" price:** You'll still make a profit, even if Bob rejects the offer. 
* **It's a fair price:** Both parties can potentially be happy with the deal."
