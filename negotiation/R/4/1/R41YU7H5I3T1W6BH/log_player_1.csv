"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a good starting point to maximize my potential earnings.  This price is higher than my minimum value, but not unreasonable. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy in the following rounds based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price.  I believe there's still room for a higher offer that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $135. This is a compromise, but it's still higher than my minimum value, and I hope it will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his offer, and I'm concerned that we'll continue to go back and forth without reaching a mutually agreeable price.  I've already lost a couple of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price than what John is offering."
