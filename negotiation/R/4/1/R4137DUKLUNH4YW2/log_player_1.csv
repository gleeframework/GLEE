Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm looking for a price closer to $11,000. This product is truly unique and I'm confident it's worth the investment. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250?"", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000, which is the price I was originally quoted by John, but I'm willing to give you a slight premium for the product's uniqueness. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is pretty close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it's a significant improvement over his previous offers. Since we are already on round 4, it's likely that we won't get much better offers in the future. It's also worth noting that Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and is acknowledging the product's unique value. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $10,000."
