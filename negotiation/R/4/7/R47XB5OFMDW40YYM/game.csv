"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product holds for me, and I believe it's a more reasonable offer given the current market conditions.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge the current market conditions, I feel $1,100,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This compromise allows both of us to find common ground and ensures a smooth transaction. Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,125,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market conditions and the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and your perspective on the market. While $1,080,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still slightly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000 as a final compromise.  This price point allows both of us to secure a good deal while ensuring a successful transaction. Let's settle this and finalize the purchase.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that buying the product from John for $1,200,000 might be the better option for me.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
