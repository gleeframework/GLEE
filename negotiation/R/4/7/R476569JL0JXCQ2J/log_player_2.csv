"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10000. It's a steal for its value! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try and negotiate, especially when you have a backup option. There's no harm in seeing if Alice will budge on her price. If she doesn't, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $8000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $9000. This reflects the significant value of the product and allows for some room for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
