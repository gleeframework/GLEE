Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $120, so $140 is a reasonable starting point.
* **It's below your minimum value:**  You're willing to sell for at least $150, so this offer leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Bob understands what you're offering and can easily make a decision.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your leverage:**  By rejecting, you demonstrate that you are not desperate for a sale and are willing to negotiate.
* **Potentially get closer to your desired price:**  A counteroffer from you could potentially push Bob closer to your target price, or at least provide more information about his willingness to pay.
* **Explore the option of selling to John:** If Bob proves unwilling to meet your minimum, you can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $120 and your previous offer of $140. This shows you're willing to negotiate while still maintaining a price above your minimum.
* **Reasoning:**  The message emphasizes fairness and the value of the product, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Final offer?**  This counteroffer could be your final offer before resorting to selling to John. However, the message leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is willing to go a bit higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $135 is still slightly higher than what I'm comfortable with. Would you consider reducing the price to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to your minimum price, it still falls short of your ideal profit margin.  Given Bob's unwillingness to budge significantly, it's wiser to:

* **Maximize your profit:** Selling to John guarantees you $150, which is more than Bob's current offer and aligns with your minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lengthy process with no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Minimize risk:** Selling to John eliminates the risk of Bob's counteroffers dropping the price even further. 

This decision prioritizes your financial goals and minimizes the potential for loss."
