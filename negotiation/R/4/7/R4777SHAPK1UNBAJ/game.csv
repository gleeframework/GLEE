"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $135 is still slightly higher than what I'm comfortable with. Would you consider reducing the price to $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
