Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $130 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $135 is still a good deal and I'm getting closer to my goal.  It's not worth risking losing the sale altogether by pushing for more."
