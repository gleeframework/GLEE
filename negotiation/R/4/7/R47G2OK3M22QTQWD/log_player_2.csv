"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to him, there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  He's better off trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This initial offer signals his seriousness in negotiating a lower price while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a price closer to his ideal $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing willingness to compromise, moving up from his initial $10,000 offer. This demonstrates he is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal.  The $11,000 offer is a reasonable midpoint between his initial offer and Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, and with only 5 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  Accepting the offer at this point ensures Bob gets the product at a good price while avoiding the potential of Alice getting more stubborn or the negotiation falling apart completely."
