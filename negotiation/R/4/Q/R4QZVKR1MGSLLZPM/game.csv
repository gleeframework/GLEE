"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant returns you'll see.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is considerably below what I'd consider. This product offers significant long-term value that I believe you're undervaluing. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also reflects the true worth of this unique product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has significant long-term value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
