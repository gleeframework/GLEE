Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Not too high:**  I'm not going straight to my minimum, as that might make Bob immediately reject the offer. 
* **Leaving room for John:** My offer leaves me some wiggle room in case Bob makes a counteroffer that's too low, allowing me to potentially still sell to John for a higher price.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't commit to $1,250,000. How about we try $1,100,000? I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired profit. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially securing a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and keep the negotiation open to potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  I'm making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. However, it's not a huge concession, and still allows me to make a profit significantly above my minimum.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I'm using language like ""fair deal"" and ""reflects the value"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and try to create a win-win scenario.
* **Keep pressure on:**  I'm not giving up on a higher price entirely, leaving room for further negotiation if Bob still rejects this offer. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'll consider it, but I'd like to propose $1,125,000 as a compromise. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is just $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:**  While I could counter again, it's very likely Bob will stick to his offer. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer and ultimately result in a lower price or a failed deal.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is close to my minimum, minimizing the risk of getting a lower price or losing the deal entirely."
