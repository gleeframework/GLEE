"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price gives you a significant saving. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $11,000?  That's still a great price for you and allows me to get a fair value for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price for Bob.  It's still lower than John's price, and Bob saves $4,000 compared to John's offer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, so it's best to accept and move on."
