{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price gives you a significant saving. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than my minimum but still lower than Bob's perceived value. It gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, while also making it clear that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $11,000?  That's still a great price for you and allows me to get a fair value for my product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
