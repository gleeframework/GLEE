"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $11,000?  That's still a great price for you and allows me to get a fair value for my product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
