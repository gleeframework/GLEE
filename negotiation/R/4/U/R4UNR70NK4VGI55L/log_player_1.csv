"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price slightly above my minimum. This sets the tone and gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me, especially considering I'm willing to accept $12,000 from John. I have time to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further. However, I'm still well above my minimum acceptable price and within a range that's likely to be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Considering I have limited rounds and the risk of selling to John for a lower price, it's a good deal for me."
