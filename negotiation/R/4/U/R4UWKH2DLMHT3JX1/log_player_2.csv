"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob.**  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. This means Bob saves $2,500 compared to buying from John.
* **The potential savings outweigh any risk.**  While Alice claims it's a one-time offer, it's not a major risk to accept. Even if Bob could find a slightly better deal later, he's still saving a significant amount by accepting Alice's offer."
