"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
 
You have a clear upper limit of $15,000, and Alice's initial offer is within your range.  However, you can try to save some money by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, the value of this product is quite high, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While you could try to push for a lower price, it's likely that Alice will be reluctant to go any lower.  Accepting the offer at $13,500 saves you money compared to buying from John, and it's a fair price for both parties."
