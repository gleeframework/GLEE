"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $10,000 is still too high for Bob, and there's a chance to get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

Bob should start by making a strong counteroffer. $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  This price reflects Bob's maximum budget while also acknowledging Alice's value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit high. It's worth trying to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal. There are still rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob should make another counteroffer, this time slightly higher than his previous offer to show he's willing to compromise. $9,000 is a good middle ground that might entice Alice to accept. It's still below his maximum budget but indicates he's serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice is proving difficult to negotiate with, and her offer of $9,750 is very close to Bob's maximum budget. While there are still rounds left, the risk of further haggling and ending up with a worse deal is high.  Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees the best price and avoids potential further negotiation complications."
