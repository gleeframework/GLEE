"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $95. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $105 is closer to what I was hoping for, I still believe we could find a better solution. Could you possibly consider selling the product to me for $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $108. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",108.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget constraints. However, I'm still unable to meet at $108. I would like to propose a final offer of $100. This aligns closely with both our interests and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",100.0,Bob,6,
