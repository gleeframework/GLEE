"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about $850,000? It's a compromise that still allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, so I'll offer $800,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
