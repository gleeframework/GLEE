Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high but reasonable starting point:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Highlighting value and exclusivity:** The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the offer as an exclusive opportunity, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Leaving John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay the full $1,200,000 gives Alice leverage. She can afford to negotiate with Bob, knowing she has a guaranteed buyer.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while also considering the possibility of a successful negotiation with Bob."
