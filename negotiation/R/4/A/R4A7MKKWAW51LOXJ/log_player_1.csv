I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a good starting point above my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$8,000 is far too low for me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer him the product for $12,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
