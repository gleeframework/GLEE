"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's keep talking!",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider my offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,450,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,7,
