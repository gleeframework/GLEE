"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $12,000, which is my minimum price, but I think you'll really like the product at this price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is pushing my budget but shows my serious interest. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $11,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000, which is a fair compromise and shows how much I want this product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $11,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,7,
