Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for the product. Would that work for you?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $7,500.  The product is worth significantly more. How about we settle on $8,250? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 8250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I could potentially stretch my budget to $7,750.  Do you think that could work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum price of $8,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
