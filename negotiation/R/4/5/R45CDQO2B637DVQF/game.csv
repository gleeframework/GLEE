"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, but $12,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a fair compromise. This product is worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll see its value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $13,000 is too high for me. I would like to offer $12,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
