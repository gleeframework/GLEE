"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, $900,000,  knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me with a significant profit. I'm also emphasizing the value to Bob, hoping to motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I want to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $850000, which would be $800000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly what John is offering. This is the best I can get without risking losing the sale to John. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
