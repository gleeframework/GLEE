"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong opening offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a high anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I offer a reason for the high price (""unique features and potential"") without revealing specifics about my own valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My tone is friendly and I invite Bob's feedback, signaling my willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts, I get a fantastic deal.
2. **Provide negotiation room:** Even if he rejects this initial offer, it gives us space to bargain without going below my minimum. 
3. **Gauge Bob's position:** His response will reveal how eager he is to buy and how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my initial offer and significantly above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. This indicates there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I believe the product is worth more while keeping the door open for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the product's value.  While your offer is generous, I believe it falls short of its true potential. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but counter with a price that's a compromise ($100,000 less than my initial offer) but still significantly above his perceived value.  I frame it as ""meeting halfway"" to encourage agreement.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The $1,900,000 price point keeps me in a strong negotiating position while still leaving room for potential further concessions if needed. 
* **Urgency Not Yet a Factor:** We are still in the early rounds of negotiation, and I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a lower offer just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the market value and my budget, I think a fair price for the product would be $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, showing he's motivated to buy. However, the price is still below my $1,900,000 counteroffer and significantly above his perceived value.  I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm firm on my valuation while encouraging him to move closer to my desired price point. There's still room for negotiation before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,850,000.  This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($50,000) to demonstrate flexibility but also to signal that I'm getting closer to my bottom line.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I continue to emphasize the inherent value of the product, subtly reminding Bob that my price is justified.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The offer of $1,850,000 is a clear attempt to find a middle ground between his last offer and mine. It's getting closer to a point where I may need to consider accepting to avoid losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the current market conditions and my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob has come up to $1,800,000, which is a reasonable profit margin for me. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and further haggling might make him walk away.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could hold out for more, I risk pushing Bob away and losing the deal.  The certainty of $1,800,000 now outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price later, especially considering the time value of money.
* **Strong Position:**  I've negotiated well, securing a price significantly above Bob's perceived value and comfortably above my minimum. 

It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
