"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $135.  This is a bit above what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $115 is too low for me, especially considering the product is worth $120 to me. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still a bit above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's a more reasonable compromise. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $110 is too low for me. I'm willing to go lower than $125, but not that low. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it's the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping Bob will agree to this price, as it's still a good deal for him."
