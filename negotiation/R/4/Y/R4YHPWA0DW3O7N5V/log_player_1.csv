``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for bargaining.  I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 value as possible without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply not a realistic price for this product.  Considering its value to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This represents a significant discount and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we possibly settle at $775,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  However, I'm getting closer to a deal. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This offer is a significant concession, and it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for your business. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to accept it.  Any further negotiation would risk losing the deal and only bring a negligible increase in the price.  It's time to close this deal!"
