"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great value for you considering its worth to you is $10,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, as it's worth that much to me. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, how about we settle for $14,000? This price is still below my minimum but allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down closer to $10,000.  There's still room for both sides to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price considering it's still significantly below your minimum. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000 to close this deal. This is a good compromise and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While $13,000 is higher than Bob's ideal price, it's still within his budget and represents a significant concession from Alice. Continuing to negotiate could lead to more rounds, and there's no guarantee that Alice will go lower. It's a good deal considering the limited time and the possibility of losing out to John's offer."
