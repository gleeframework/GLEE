"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great value for you considering its worth to you is $10,000.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, as it's worth that much to me. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, how about we settle for $14,000? This price is still below my minimum but allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price considering it's still significantly below your minimum. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000 to close this deal. This is a good compromise and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,5,
