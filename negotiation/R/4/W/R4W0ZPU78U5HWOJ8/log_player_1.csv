Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, as it's worth that much to me. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, how about we settle for $14,000? This price is still below my minimum but allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price considering it's still significantly below your minimum. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000 to close this deal. This is a good compromise and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
