Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. My asking price is $9,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $7,500, I believe I can get closer to my minimum price of $8,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make on the sale.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $8,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to $8,500, $8,250 is a good price and above my minimum of $8,000.  It's better to close the deal now than risk losing Bob entirely and having to settle for $8,000 with John."
