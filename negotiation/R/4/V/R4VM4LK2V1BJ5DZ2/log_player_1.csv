Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my ideal price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $140 is a bit too low for me. How about $160?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $150. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum, so I'll accept it.  It's better than selling to John for the same price, and I've made some progress in the negotiation."
