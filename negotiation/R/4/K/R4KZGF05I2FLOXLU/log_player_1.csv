"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $950,000, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob is still significantly under the product's value to me and John's offer. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  However,  $775,000 still undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both – would you consider $837,500?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced about the price. I'd like to propose a price of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Bob is not showing a willingness to meet near the product's value.  It's unlikely he'll suddenly jump to an acceptable price in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $800,000."
