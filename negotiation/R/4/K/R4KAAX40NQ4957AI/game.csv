"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,175,000 is not within my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
