"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,300,000 for this product. I believe this is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,380,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1380000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,380,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,300,000. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work together. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you, and I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *between our last two offers* and propose $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",1325000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,340,000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. Let's try to find a new middle ground.",1340000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to an agreement.  However, $1,340,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $1,330,000. This would be a good outcome for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",1330000.0,Bob,8,
