"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to split the difference and pay $90 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to give you a slight discount and offer it to you for $95. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
