"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,800,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product for $800,000 from John. It's worth exploring negotiating with Alice first, as he might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

Bob should offer Alice his maximum price.  He knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, so this is a very low offer.  It's unlikely Alice will accept, but it establishes Bob's budget and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,300,000 is a better price than her first offer, it's still above his $800,000 budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as she might be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob should offer $1,000,000.  This is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing he's willing to compromise, but still keeps him within his budget. It's a good middle ground to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,200,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  He has a guaranteed alternative with John, so there's no pressure to settle for more than he wants. He should continue negotiating with Alice, as there is still potential to reach a price closer to his desired target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Bob should offer $1,100,000. This is a slight increase from his previous offer, demonstrating that he's willing to negotiate, but still well within his budget. It's a good strategy to show Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is also firm on his price limit.  This might encourage Alice to accept his counteroffer or make a more favorable counter-offer herself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,150,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still a significant amount more than he's willing to pay. With only a few rounds left, he should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price.  If he doesn't, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Bob should offer $1,050,000. This is a slight increase from his previous offer, showing continued willingness to negotiate, but still maintains his budget. With only 3 rounds left, it's a final attempt to get Alice closer to his desired price before resorting to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000.  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above his budget.  With only one round left, it's unlikely he will be able to negotiate a better price. Buying from John guarantees him the product at a price he is comfortable with."
