"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me in the middle at $17500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $17,500 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $17,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more for this product. How about $19,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still get great value for your investment."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $19000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $18000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $18000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $18,000 is above my minimum of $15,000. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a higher price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's better to secure a sale at this point than to continue negotiating and potentially risk losing both Bob and John."
