"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $1200000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1000000. This would be a great deal for both of us, as I'm a serious buyer, and it would leave you with a healthy profit.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to go to $1050000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as I'm a serious buyer, and I know this product has great potential.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's say we meet in the middle of our last two offers, which would be $1075000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
