{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum budget. It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a lower price, especially when you have multiple options.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if Alice is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1,000,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, as I'm a serious buyer, and it would leave you with a healthy profit."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to negotiate, which is a good sign.  Her counteroffer is still above your desired price, but it's closer.  Rejecting again shows you're serious about getting a better deal and encourages further negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to go to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as I'm a serious buyer, and I know this product has great potential.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's say we meet in the middle of our last two offers, which would be $1075000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price, and her offer is now within a reasonable range.  While you could continue negotiating, the potential for further savings is limited.  Accepting this offer saves you $25,000 compared to buying from John and represents a good deal overall."
