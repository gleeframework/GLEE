"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I can come down a bit further, but $10500 is too low for me. I'm willing to let it go for $11000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still not ideal.  Bob has a few rounds left and it's worth seeing if he can negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you.  $10750 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10875. This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm sure you'll appreciate the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** $10,875 is within Bob's budget of $12,000 and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer is closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Risk:** While further negotiation is possible, it's getting closer to the end of the rounds, and there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible or Bob losing the opportunity.

Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price while avoiding the higher cost of buying from John."
