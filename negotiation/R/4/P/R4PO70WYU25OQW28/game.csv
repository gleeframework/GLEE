"Hi Alice,  $11500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I can come down a bit further, but $10500 is too low for me. I'm willing to let it go for $11000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10750.  Let's meet in the middle.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $10750 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10875. This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm sure you'll appreciate the value of the product.",10875.0,Alice,5,
