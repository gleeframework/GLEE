"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  
* **Selling to John is an Option:** However, I'm keeping the option to sell to John for $12,000 open if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him to make my counteroffer more appealing.
* **Showing Flexibility:** While my counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer, it demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there is still potential for Bob to come closer to my price, considering he is already willing to go higher.
* **John Remains an Option:**  However, if negotiations with Bob don't lead to a better deal, I can still sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $7,250 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $7,750? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that's still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a compromise to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering to split the difference often feels fair to both parties."
