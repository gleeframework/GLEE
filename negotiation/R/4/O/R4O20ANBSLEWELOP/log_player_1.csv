Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I can potentially get a better price.  $7,500 is too far below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $8,500. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While time is ticking,  $7,000 is still too low for me. It's not worth risking selling for less than my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair price that's closer to my value and hopefully something you can work with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
