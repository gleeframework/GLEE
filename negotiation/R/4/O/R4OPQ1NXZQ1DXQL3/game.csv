"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $875000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $862500? I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",862500.0,Bob,4,
