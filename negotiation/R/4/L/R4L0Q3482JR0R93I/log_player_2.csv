"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers.  Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your acceptable range. If Alice doesn't budge, you're safe knowing you can get the product for a much better price from John."
