"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows good faith and potentially sets the stage for a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $91. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $91 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible. He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing he's willing to negotiate, but is still holding firm on his desired price point. This counteroffer is a compromise, and could potentially lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go below $90, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $89. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $89, which is just $1 above Bob's preferred price.  Considering that Bob can buy the product from John for $100, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Bob saves $11 compared to buying from John and secures the product for a price that's very close to his desired amount."
