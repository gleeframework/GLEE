"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I can offer $1,100,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer! I see you're serious about this purchase with the increase in your offer. To be completely transparent, I have a firm bottom line of $1,500,000 for this product.  I'm confident it's a fair price considering its true value. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
