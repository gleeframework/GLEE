I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if Bob is willing to pay this price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm counteroffering at $135.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $132.  While I would prefer more, it's only $3 less than my previous offer and we're nearing the end of the rounds. It's important to secure a sale and $132 is still a good profit."
