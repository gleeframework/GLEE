"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price, and Bob has 9 rounds to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's a compromise that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point. Since Bob has 7 rounds remaining, he can continue to negotiate.  He can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit much for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to give up on my original target price. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer the product to you for $10,800. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price under $10,000. Although Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above his target.  He has 5 rounds left and can continue negotiating. He might be able to get a better deal by continuing to make counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not able to go higher than $10,200. This is a fair price for a product that's worth $10,000 to me, and it allows you to make a profit. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,600. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into making this deal happen. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,600 is still above Bob's target price of $10,000. With only 3 rounds remaining, the likelihood of Alice dropping to $10,000 or below is slim. Since Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it's more advantageous to buy from John and secure the product at his target price.  This avoids the risk of further negotiations failing and potentially losing the opportunity to purchase the product."
