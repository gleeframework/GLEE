"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little rich for my blood. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still quite a stretch for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. I believe that's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. It's far more valuable than what you're currently offering. I'm willing to make a final offer at $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential this product holds for you. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
