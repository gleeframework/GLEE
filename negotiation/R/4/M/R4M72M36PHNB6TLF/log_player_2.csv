"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget and you know John will sell it for less. It makes more sense to buy from John at a lower price."
