"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This is a great deal, considering the value you place on the product is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's clear she's starting the negotiation significantly above your maximum budget. You should reject this offer and make a counteroffer much closer to your acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. Unfortunately, that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $900,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While this counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, it's strategic to start low in negotiations. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how much Alice is willing to move on price. If she completely rejects this offer, it might indicate a smaller potential bargaining range. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you always have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000. This provides you leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but $900,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice has moved down in price, $1,400,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to move from $1,800,000 to $1,400,000 suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Having John's offer of $1,200,000 gives you a strong alternative. You can use this as leverage to encourage Alice to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Could you do $1,100,000? I think that would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increment:** This counteroffer moves up in a significant but not excessive increment from your previous offer. It signals your willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price within your budget.
* **Approaching Your Limit:** This offer is getting close to your upper limit of $1,200,000.  You'll need to decide how much more you're willing to concede in the next round if Alice doesn't accept. 
* **Pressure on Alice:** By now, Alice should see you're serious about the purchase but also firm on your budget. This might encourage her to make a more substantial move towards your price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,100,000, which is $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still slightly above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Minimal Gains:** Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings.  Alice is likely anchored close to this price point.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000. It makes more sense to take the sure deal and save the extra $50,000. 

At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her not budging further and the certainty of John's offer."
