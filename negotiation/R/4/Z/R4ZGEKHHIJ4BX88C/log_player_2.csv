"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You're better off rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. It's possible you can get Alice to come down closer to your $10,000 budget."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit lower than I'd like to go. I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a fair compromise and within your budget.  It's better to take the deal than risk another counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John at the same price."
