Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product's value is $1,000,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By initially offering a much higher price ($1,500,000), Alice anchors Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level. This makes it more likely Bob will counter with an offer above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, eliminating the risk of losing out entirely. This empowers her to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize potential profit. However, it's essential to be prepared for Bob to reject the initial offer. Alice can then choose to negotiate or proceed with the sale to John."
