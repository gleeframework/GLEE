Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that's agreeable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to raise his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go a little lower than my initial asking price, but I'm not ready to settle for that yet.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $15,500.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I hope Bob will accept it, as I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is dragging on.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than settling for less than my minimum."
