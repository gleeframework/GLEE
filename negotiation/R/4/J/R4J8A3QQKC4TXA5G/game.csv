"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,500,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $850,000.  If you're able to work within that range, I think we can make a deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. I think it's a fair price, considering the value this product will bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
