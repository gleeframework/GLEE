"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I will reject Alice's offer since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and buying it from her for $200 is too expensive. I will try to find a better deal.
