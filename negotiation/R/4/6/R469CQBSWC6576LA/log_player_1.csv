Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $20,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential. This is a subtle way to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly implies I'm open to negotiation, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not satisfied with the initial price.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:** By starting high, I increase the chances of getting a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** Bob's reaction will reveal his perceived value of the product. This will help me determine how much I can push for.
* **Keep John as a Safety Net:** The presence of John allows me to exit the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers are too low, ensuring I don't settle for less than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $14000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While $14,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and his counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. This suggests there's potential for a higher price.
* **Gaining Information:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to gather more information about his perceived value of the product. His counteroffer will reveal how much he's willing to spend.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. This will involve balancing the desire to get a good price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $14,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my initial price.  How about we split the difference and go with $17,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoned Counteroffer:**  I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer. Instead, I'm providing a specific counteroffer that reflects a compromise and  demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint Approach:** I've chosen a price that's in the middle of my initial asking price and Bob's counteroffer. This  signals my flexibility without completely sacrificing my desired price.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, subtly pushing him to consider the value proposition.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain Leverage:** While I've conceded, I'm not settling for a price significantly below my minimum value.
* **Test Bob's Limits:** This counteroffer will reveal how much Bob is willing to pay,  informing my next move. 
* **Keep the Negotiation Moving:** By making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will either:

* **Accept his counteroffer:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer, the negotiation ends.
* **Make another counteroffer:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll analyze his next offer and decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but I'd like to get closer to my original target of $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest counteroffer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While there's a chance I could negotiate further, the risk of continuing is high:

* **Risk of Lower Price:**  Each further round risks pushing the price down even more, potentially forcing me to accept a price below my minimum.
* **Time and Effort:** Continued negotiation will consume more time and effort, which I might be better off investing elsewhere.
* **John's Offer:**  John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is a secure and acceptable price for me. 

**Decision:**

Selling to John provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable value. It's the most logical and efficient choice in this situation."
