"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $20000 for it.  It's a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $14000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $14000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my initial price.  How about we split the difference and go with $17000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but I'd like to get closer to my original target of $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
