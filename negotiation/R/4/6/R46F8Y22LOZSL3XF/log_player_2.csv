Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. He's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum selling point. This should open the negotiation and give them both room to maneuver."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to her original asking price and further away from Bob's ideal price. While it's a better deal than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to counteroffer again, potentially offering a price closer to $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9300}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to bridge the gap between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. He's pushing for a price that's still within his desired range but shows a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer should force Alice to decide: either accept the offer and close the deal or risk losing the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is pushing for a higher price.  At this point, Bob's chances of getting a better deal from Alice are slim. He's already made several counteroffers, and Alice is showing a pattern of increasing her price instead of compromising. Given that John is still offering a price within Bob's budget, it's more advantageous to buy from John to avoid further negotiation with Alice and potential price increases."
