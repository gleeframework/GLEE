Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it also shows that I value the product highly.  I'm confident that I can sell the product for at least $8,000 to John if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or no sale at all."
