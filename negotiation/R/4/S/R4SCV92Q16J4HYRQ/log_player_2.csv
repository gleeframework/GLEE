{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum price ($1,200,000).  I want to try to negotiate a better price. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to go higher, especially since I'm clearly interested in the product.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the price, it's a bit lower than I'm able to go right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, we're still not willing to sell the product at $1,025,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,037,500, which is within my acceptable range.  While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and the possibility of a lengthy negotiation is not worth the potential savings. I'm comfortable accepting the offer and getting the product for a good price."
