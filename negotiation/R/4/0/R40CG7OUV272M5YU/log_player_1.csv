Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I believe it's worth a significant amount due to its unique features and benefits. I'm proposing a price of $15,000. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $15,000 gives you a buffer. 
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique features"" and ""benefits"" might pique Bob's interest without revealing too much. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further""  signals that you're open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's worth to Bob, you don't know his financial limits or how much he's willing to spend. 
* **One Chance:** You only get one shot with Bob. If he rejects this offer, you're going with John at $12,000. 

Let me know if you'd like to explore other pricing strategies!"
