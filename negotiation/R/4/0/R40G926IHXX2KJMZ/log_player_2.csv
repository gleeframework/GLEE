"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and Alice offered to sell it for $12,000. This is significantly more than the $8,000 I'm willing to pay. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering Alice $8,500 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and is closer to my maximum budget. I believe this is a fair offer, given the product's worth to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I will reject Alice's offer and continue to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,000. This is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer and within my budget.  I hope this shows my willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,200 is still above my budget, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. At this point, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to take the safe route and buy the product from John for $8,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoid further negotiation."
