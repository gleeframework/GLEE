"Alice, $160 is way too high for me.  I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me.  This product is high-quality and I know you'd get a lot of use out of it. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $140 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $80 to me. What do you say?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $120? That's my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
