Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  Let's meet in the middle at $15,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the lowest I'm willing to go.  It's a great deal for you!

Alice is unlikely to go below $15,000, which is already above your maximum budget. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, making it the most financially sensible option at this point."
