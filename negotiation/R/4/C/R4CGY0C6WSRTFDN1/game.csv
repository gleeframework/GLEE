"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $7,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?  I think that's a fair price.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $6,500. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $7,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500.  Would you be willing to meet me at $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $6,750. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,5,
