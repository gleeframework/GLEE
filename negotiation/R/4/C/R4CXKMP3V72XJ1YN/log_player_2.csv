"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can likely get a better price by negotiating further.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, you have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives her some room to negotiate. By offering $850,000, we're showing that we're serious about buying the product but also pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. My next offer is $875000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what we're willing to pay. While it's closer to our initial counteroffer, we can likely still negotiate a lower price. There's still room to bargain, and we have multiple rounds left.  We're not in a rush and want to ensure we get the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $860,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're continuing to push for a lower price, but we're also showing flexibility by moving closer to Alice's last offer.  $860,000 is a compromise that might be acceptable to Alice, especially since she's already lowered her price once.  We're hoping this counteroffer will lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I still think $860000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get at least $885000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession, coming down from $875,000 to $885,000.  This offer is getting closer to our desired price range, and it's likely we won't get a better deal without risking losing the opportunity to buy from Alice.  It's also important to consider the potential loss of time if we continue to negotiate. Accepting this offer allows us to secure the product at a price we're comfortable with.  We're still saving a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John."
