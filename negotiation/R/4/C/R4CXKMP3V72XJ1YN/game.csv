"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. My next offer is $875000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $875000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $860000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I still think $860000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get at least $885000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
