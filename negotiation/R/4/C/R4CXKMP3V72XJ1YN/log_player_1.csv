Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're having this conversation.
