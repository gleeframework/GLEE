"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.
