"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $14,500? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price. How about $13,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
