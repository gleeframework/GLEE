{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're aiming to save as much as possible.  $120 is still too high for you.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

You are going to start by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within your budget. Let's see if she's willing to come down."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but it's still not ideal. You can potentially get a better price from her if you keep negotiating. Let's see if we can get closer to your goal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

You're getting very close to your goal price, but you still want to try and get it lower. This counteroffer is a fair compromise that might convince Alice to accept."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

```

While Alice is getting closer to your goal, you're still not there.  You have a few rounds left, so keep pushing for that lower price!"

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

You're almost at your goal price.  This counteroffer is just a slight bump up from your last one. Maybe Alice will finally agree to a price closer to your ideal."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

This is your last chance to get the product for your desired price. Even though Alice is still willing to negotiate, it's unlikely you'll get a price lower than $95. Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it's the best decision at this point."
