"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do at this time. Let's see if we can finalize this deal!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $101.25. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $101.25 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $98, but I don't think I can go any higher. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",98.0,Bob,6,
