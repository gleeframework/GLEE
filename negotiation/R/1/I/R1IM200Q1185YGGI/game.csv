"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you halfway at $800000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $850000. Can you consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $875000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this unique product. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $860000. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to walking away, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $860000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $880000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept for this product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",880000.0,Alice,7,
