Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, an outrageously high price (like $20,000) will likely make Bob immediately walk away. We want a price that is aspirational but still within the realm of possibility.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value by mentioning ""significant value."" This helps justify the higher price without explicitly stating it's worth more than Bob's valuation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, I (as Alice) can always come down in price. Having John as a backup buyer guarantees I won't have to go below my minimum of $8,000."
