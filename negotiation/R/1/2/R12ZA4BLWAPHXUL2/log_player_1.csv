Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique product that's worth a significant amount to me. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This allows for negotiation room and gives me a better starting position. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's worth to me, implying its potential value to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message invites Bob to engage in a dialogue about the price, potentially leading to a counteroffer. 
* **Having a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net if negotiations fail. This allows me to be more assertive in my pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1500000. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to push for a higher price.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John will pay $1,000,000 provides a safety net. This gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this time. I value this product highly and am willing to negotiate further. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,350,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:** $1,350,000 is a compromise that shows willingness to negotiate, but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the value of the product, emphasizing its worth to me. 
* **Focus on finding common ground:** The message expresses a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This helps keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Leaving room for more negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further bargaining, while still maintaining a firm stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1275000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  $1,275,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation progress:** Bob has come up from his initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  While I could potentially push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a good profit. 
* **John is a fallback:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net if Bob changes his mind."
