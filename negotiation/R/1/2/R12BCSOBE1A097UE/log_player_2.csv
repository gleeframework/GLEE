"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a substantial discount. This aggressive stance sets the stage for a potential negotiation where both parties can find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired range. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing Bob to potentially secure a price closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product and the savings you'll get from selling it to me."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly, but still pushing for a price closer to his target.  He's also highlighting the benefits for both parties to emphasize the value of reaching a deal.  This approach increases the chances of Alice accepting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11,250. This is still a great deal, and I believe it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but $11,250 is still a good deal considering the product's value to him.  It's better than John's offer of $15,000, and with only a few rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a worse outcome. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a successful purchase within a reasonable price range."
