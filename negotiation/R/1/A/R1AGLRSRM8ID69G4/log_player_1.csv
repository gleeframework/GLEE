Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me a strong starting point for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent counteroffers.  I'm confident that I can get a good price for this product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  I need to negotiate further to secure a better deal.  I'm confident I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm offering $750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer.  I believe this price is fair, and I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $600,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

I'm offering $650,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still a significant decrease from my initial offer. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a fair compromise and accepts. If he rejects, I'll be forced to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough.  I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially getting a lower offer."
