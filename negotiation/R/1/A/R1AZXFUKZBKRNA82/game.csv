"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1800000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1400000 isn't quite meeting my expectations.  Let's split the difference and call it $1600000.  This would give us both a good deal, and we can move forward with the transaction.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is my absolute limit. If you're serious about selling, let's close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle on $1550000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. ",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1550000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my offer of $1500000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
