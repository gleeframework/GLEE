"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you considering me. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to offer you $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $95. If you're willing to consider that, I'm ready to move forward.  Let me know!",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $105 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
