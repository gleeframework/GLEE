Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, selling to Bob allows us to potentially earn more.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets the product for $200,000 less than its value to him.
    * Alice makes $300,000 more than selling to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while keeping the safety net of John's offer."
