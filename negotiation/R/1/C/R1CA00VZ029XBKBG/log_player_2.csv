"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, and I know you're also looking for something like this. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it at a fair price, and I'll be able to get a bit more for it than my minimum. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly above his maximum price point, he can get the same product from John for $10,000. Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves Bob $500."
