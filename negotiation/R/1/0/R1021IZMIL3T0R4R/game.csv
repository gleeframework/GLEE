"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to make one more counteroffer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already stretched my budget to consider $950000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm going to have to think carefully about whether I can afford this product at all. Can you consider one more concession? I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",975000.0,Bob,6,
