"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $950,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $900,000. That's the lowest I can go, considering the product's value. Would you be willing to meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $900,000 is pushing the upper limit of my budget.  Would you be willing to settle at $875,000? That's a firm offer from my side.",875000.0,Bob,6,
