Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a strategic offer. Here's why:

* **Above your minimum:** It's higher than your guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, leaving room for potential profit.
* **Not too high:** It's not so high that it makes Bob immediately reject the offer. There's a chance he might value the product higher and accept.

This approach balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for earning more than the minimum value."
