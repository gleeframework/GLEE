Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and also establishes my position as the seller with the upper hand.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A price of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, leaving room for compromise while still ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly, but not below my minimum. If he counteroffers, I'll evaluate the offer and either accept, counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting it would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows his interest in the product.  There's still potential for a more favorable deal through negotiation.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob.  I will try to find a price that is acceptable to both of us, but I will not go below my minimum price of $1,200,000. If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I will consider selling the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would still give you a great deal and allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is the midpoint between my initial offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This demonstrates willingness to compromise and potentially reach an agreement.
* **Fair Value:** The price of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This leaves room for further negotiation while ensuring I don't lose too much.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and focused on reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll consider adjusting my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** I'll finalize the sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess whether to lower the price further or move on to John.
* **If Bob counteroffers:** I'll carefully consider the offer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $950000? That's a bit closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial financial loss.
* **Negotiations Stalemated:**  The negotiations seem to be stuck. While Bob is willing to increase his offer, it's not moving toward a price that benefits me.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob.  I will try to find a price that is acceptable to both of us, but I will not go below my minimum price of $1,200,000. If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I will sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer explicitly positions it as my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or walk away.
* **Slight Compromise:** The price of $1,050,000 is a slight reduction from my previous offer of $1,000,000, showing I am still willing to compromise. 
* **Clear Deadline:** The message states that I'll explore other options if Bob declines, emphasizing the urgency and potentially pushing him to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I'll finalize the sale.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll immediately sell the product to John for $1,200,000. There's little chance of further negotiation with Bob at this point, and it's not worth risking further delays for a potentially smaller profit."
