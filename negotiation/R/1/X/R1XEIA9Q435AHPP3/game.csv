"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we value it at $10000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in making a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted price. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $7500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $6500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in it.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $7200, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $7200 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",6000.0,Bob,6,
