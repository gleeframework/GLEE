``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming to get as close to my desired $15,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that Bob's value is $12,000. So, I'm offering a price that's slightly above his perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $12,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,250 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my desired $15,000. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,250 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's try $13,500. This would be a good price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that this product is worth a lot to you, but I'm still not willing to go above $12,750. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $12,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's clear that we're at an impasse.  I'm better off selling to John for $15,000 and avoiding further haggling."
