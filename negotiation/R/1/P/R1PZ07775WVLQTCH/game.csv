"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,250 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's try $13,500. This would be a good price for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that this product is worth a lot to you, but I'm still not willing to go above $12,750. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12,000",12750.0,Bob,6,
