"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000.  It's a real steal, and I believe it's worth much more to the right person.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  $8000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking of $9500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and $9500 is definitely a step in the right direction. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Would you consider $9750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'm still trying to squeeze out a bit more savings. I can do $9500, but I need you to meet me at that price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,6,
