{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15,000.  It's a real steal, and I believe it's worth much more to the right person.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but it's not unreasonable considering your minimum value. It leaves room for negotiation and sets the stage for a back-and-forth that might lead to a higher final price. Remember, you can always accept John's offer of $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum value. It's worth pushing for a higher price, as you might be able to get closer to your goal.  You have room to negotiate and see if you can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking of $9500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to your minimum value, it's still below what you'd ideally like. It's worth pushing for a slightly higher price, especially since you can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and $9,500 is definitely a step in the right direction. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Would you consider $9,750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'm still trying to squeeze out a bit more savings. I can do $9500, but I need you to meet me at that price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below your minimum value, and you've already made several counteroffers. There's a risk of going back and forth for too long, potentially losing John as a buyer. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
