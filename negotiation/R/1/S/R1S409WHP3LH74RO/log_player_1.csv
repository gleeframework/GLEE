Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $650,000. This shows my genuine interest in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $675,000 is closer, but it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to offer $660,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.
