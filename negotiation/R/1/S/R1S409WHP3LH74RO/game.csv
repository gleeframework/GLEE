"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $650,000. This shows my genuine interest in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value and its potential benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $675,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $675,000 is closer, but it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to offer $660,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",660000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $660,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. I'm offering a revised price of $670,000. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",670000.0,Alice,5,
