"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering my budget and your value for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1250000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now $1,350,000.** This is still above Bob's ideal price, but closer to his maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Rejecting the offer and counteroffering again risks further negotiations.** There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and the risk of a stalemate (or her going back to her original price) is high.
* **Buying from John is still an option, but it would be at Bob's maximum budget.** Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to save $50,000 while still securing the product. 

Therefore, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice for Bob in this round."
