Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my earnings. This gives Bob room to negotiate if he's interested but doesn't feel the product is worth $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price of $140, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a compromise that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $135, which is closer to my desired price.  It's not ideal, but it's above my minimum and higher than what John would pay.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale."
