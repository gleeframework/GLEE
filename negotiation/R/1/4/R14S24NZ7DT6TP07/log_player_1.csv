Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get the highest price possible from Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, there's room to negotiate above my minimum.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming high. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to be firm in my pricing.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning listing it publicly implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't act soon.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you know about Bob's negotiating style, you could adjust the price higher or lower."
