Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without losing him to a guaranteed sale with John ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for Bob ($150,000) while still securing a substantial gain for you ($350,000 over your minimum).
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer, we incentivize Bob to act quickly and increase the perceived value of the product."
