Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal even if he gets a discount. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive message can make Bob more open to negotiation. 
* **Open Ended:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100 and well below my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my minimum, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $100, but I want to see if I can get a better price through negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90? That would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $90 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Highlight value:**  Emphasizing that it's still a ""great deal"" for Bob can make him more inclined to agree. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  By saying ""I'm willing to come down a bit"" I show that I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for a final counteroffer:**  While Bob is getting closer, I can still attempt to negotiate a higher price.  
* **Avoid selling to John (for now):**  I want to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John now would guarantee $100, but I'm hoping to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $85?  That's my final offer, and it's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my last attempt to negotiate. 
* **Meeting halfway:** Offering $85 is a compromise between my previous offer of $90 and Bob's current offer of $75.
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable, making him more likely to accept. 
* **Positive tone:** Using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""understand"" maintains a friendly tone."
