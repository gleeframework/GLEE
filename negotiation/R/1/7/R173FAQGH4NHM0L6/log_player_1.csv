Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes it more likely to secure a price closer to your ideal.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message hints at its value, making the higher price seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.

By starting at $10,000, Alice gives herself a cushion to potentially:

* **Accept a counter-offer:**  Bob might counter with $9,000, still netting Alice a profit.
* **Hold firm:** If Bob really values the product, he might accept the $10,000 price.

Worst case scenario, Alice has John as a guaranteed backup buyer at her minimum acceptable price."
