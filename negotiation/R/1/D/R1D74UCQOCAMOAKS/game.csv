"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $650000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. I'm prepared to offer $700000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $725000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to you. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,
