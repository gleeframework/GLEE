This offer is a starting point. It's fair to both of us, and it allows for potential negotiation. It also sets the stage for a possible counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's far below the product's worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to go down to $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm prepared to negotiate further."
