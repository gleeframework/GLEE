"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, and I'm ready to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering the value to me. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,600,000 represents the high end of this product's value, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects a more moderate stance while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.  What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000, which is closer to what I'm comfortable with. This offer takes into account the value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
