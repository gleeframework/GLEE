"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and your own asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
