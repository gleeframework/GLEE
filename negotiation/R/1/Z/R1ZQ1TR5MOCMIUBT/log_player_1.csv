Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to earn more than $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

The ideal strategy is to offer a price that's appealing to Bob (meaning it's significantly less than $1,500,000) while maximizing your profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and to make this a win-win, I'm offering it at a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Respectful:**  The message is straightforward and addresses Bob personally.
* **Highlighting Value:**  It subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **""Win-Win"":** This framing positions the negotiation as mutually beneficial.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,300,000 is a significant profit for you ($300,000 above your minimum) and saves Bob $200,000. It's a strong incentive for him to accept.

**Important Note:** This offer assumes you have no further information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations."
