"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $500000 is significantly lower than my budget for this type of purchase.  To demonstrate my interest, I'd be willing to consider a price of $900000. This reflects a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiations.
