Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob is willing to match or exceed that price. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) establishes a strong position. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While you've started high, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's truly interested but finds the price a bit steep. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired price."
