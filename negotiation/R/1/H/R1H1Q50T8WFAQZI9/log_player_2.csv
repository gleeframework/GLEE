You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

You know you can get the same product from John for $12,000. Since Alice is also offering it for $12,000, there's no benefit to buying from her. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with John, but the prompt doesn't allow for that."
