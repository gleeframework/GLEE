Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  It's important to remember we have John as a backup buyer at $150, so we shouldn't go below that price with Bob."
