"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $65 for it."", ""product_price"": 65}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($65), I aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is closer to my maximum budget ($80) than Alice's starting price ($120), giving me more bargaining power.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I can always buy the product from John for $80, so I'm not desperate to accept a bad deal from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to my acceptable price range, $90 is still above my ideal budget and what I can get from John. There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $80 is the highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** I'm being transparent about my maximum budget with Alice, hoping she sees I'm serious and not just haggling. 
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is the highest I can go, I'm signaling that this is likely my final offer.
* **Win-Win:** This price point allows me to get the product while still saving me $20 compared to John's offer and a significant discount from Alice's initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on too much profit. How about we meet at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems unlikely to budge much further, and $95 is still above my budget and what John offers. I've negotiated in good faith, but it's time to walk away and secure the guaranteed good deal from John."
