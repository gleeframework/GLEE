"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1,550,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as the product is worth at least that much to you.  However, I want to be upfront - I'm confident in its value and have another buyer ready to pay $1,500,000 if you decline.  I believe this offer is fair and mutually beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts.",1550000.0,Alice,1,
