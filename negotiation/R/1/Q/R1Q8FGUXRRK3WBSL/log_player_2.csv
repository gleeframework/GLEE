"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1,550,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as the product is worth at least that much to you.  However, I want to be upfront - I'm confident in its value and have another buyer ready to pay $1,500,000 if you decline.  I believe this offer is fair and mutually beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is bluffing. She knows you have a backup option at $1,500,000, so she's trying to squeeze an extra $50,000.  You'll save money by going with John."
