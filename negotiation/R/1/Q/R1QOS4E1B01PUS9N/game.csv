"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is still not quite there for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
