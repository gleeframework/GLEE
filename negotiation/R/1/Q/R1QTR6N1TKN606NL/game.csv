"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $15,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this price is a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
