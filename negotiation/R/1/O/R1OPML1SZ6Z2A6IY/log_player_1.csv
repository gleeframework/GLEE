Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your guaranteed price from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $500,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,000,000) to be made if you can sell it to Bob at the right price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum perceived value increases the chances of a quick and successful sale.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it's worth significantly more to the right buyer. I'm offering it to you at $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:** ""Exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" subtly reinforce the product's worth.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  $1,400,000 is a significant profit margin for you while still saving Bob $100,000 from his perceived value.
* **Open for Negotiation (Implied):** While you don't explicitly state it, this initial offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, further engaging him in the process. 

**Important Note:** Even if Bob counters with a lower offer, you always have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing you a minimum of $1,000,000."
