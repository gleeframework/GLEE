"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible. Since John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price.  Rejecting her offer means you can potentially negotiate with her or find another seller who might offer a better price."
