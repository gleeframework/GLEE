"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes openness to discussion, making it clear that this is a starting point and not a take-it-or-leave-it offer.
* **Time Consideration:**  While I have 10 rounds, I want to encourage Bob to engage seriously from the start. 

By setting a high initial price and fostering a collaborative tone, I aim to steer the negotiation in a favorable direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1,200,000 to $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price. While it's above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in Round 3 to try and reach a more favorable agreement before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,350,000? This reflects the true value of the product while hopefully addressing your budget."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $100,000, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly anchoring the price in Bob's mind.
* **Middle Ground:** The offered price of $1,350,000 is a compromise, closer to Bob's range but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
