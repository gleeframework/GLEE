I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll sell the product to John."
