Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from the product's value to Bob, but it still allows me to make a large profit. I'm aiming to find a price that's both attractive to Bob and allows me to maximize my earnings. I'll be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response, but I'll always have the option to sell to John if the negotiation goes sour."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, but it's still closer to my desired price than John's offer. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target of $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a substantial profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to continue negotiating with him."
