,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $170. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm going to meet you halfway between $170 and $120, which would be $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you halfway between $145 and $130, which would be $137.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",137.5,Alice,7,
