Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,000,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, which is still a premium to what I could get from another seller, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
