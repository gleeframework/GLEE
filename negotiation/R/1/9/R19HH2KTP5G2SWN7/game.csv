"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,000,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, which is still a premium to what I could get from another seller, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the product's value exceeding $2,000,000, I'm willing to meet you closer to your range. Would you consider $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for meeting me halfway, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident I can make a great return on investment.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
