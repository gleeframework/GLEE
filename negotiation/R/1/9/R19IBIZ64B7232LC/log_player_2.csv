"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since Alice is willing to sell for $1,000,000, there's room for a lower price.  We can use the counteroffer system to try and get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $100,000 drop is a substantial amount, but it leaves room for further negotiation.  If Alice is willing to accept this offer, I've saved a lot of money. If she rejects, we'll continue to refine the offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, and $850,000 is a good price.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers.  There's also the chance that I'll run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal."
