Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible while ensuring the deal is still appealing to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my initial offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, making him feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **High but Justifiable:** The message highlights the ""unique"" and ""highly valuable"" nature of the product, attempting to justify the high price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer instead of forcing me to sell to John for less."
