"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a deal for $160. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go as low as $140. It's a great price for a product that I think you'll really love, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $140 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130. This is a fair price for a product I'm interested in, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $130, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $130, so I'm offering it to you for $135. It's a fair price that I think you'll be happy with, and it's the best I can do.",135.0,Alice,7,
