"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $950,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to sell it for at least this amount.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This reflects its value to me while giving you a fair price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but I need to consider the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $887,500. This is the lowest I can go while still making a reasonable profit.",875000.0,Alice,5,
