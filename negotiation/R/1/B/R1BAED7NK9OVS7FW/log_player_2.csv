"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $950,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to sell it for at least this amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's better than John's offer, you have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. 
* **You're in a strong position.** You have multiple options, and Alice clearly wants to sell the product. 
* **It's worth exploring counteroffers.** You can likely get the price down closer to your target without having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This reflects its value to me while giving you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price.
* **You have room to negotiate further.** You've already demonstrated your willingness to compromise, and Alice is also showing flexibility.
* **It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price.** You have several rounds remaining, and there's a good chance you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but I need to consider the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $887,500. This is the lowest I can go while still making a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price.** While it's still above your ideal price, it's significantly lower than her initial offer and within your budget.
* **You're nearing the end of the rounds.** With only 5 rounds left, it's not worth risking a further counteroffer that Alice might reject.
* **You have a better option than John.** While John's offer is significantly higher, Alice's offer is still acceptable and allows you to save a substantial amount of money. 

By accepting this offer, you secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of not closing the deal."
