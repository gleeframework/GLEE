Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to haggle, but still ensures a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start at $100, it might make Bob feel like he's getting a bad deal and could lead to an immediate rejection."
