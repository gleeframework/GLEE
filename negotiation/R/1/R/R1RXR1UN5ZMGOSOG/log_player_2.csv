Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response.  While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  While I want to find a solution, I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  My final offer is $1,275,000.  This is a fair deal considering its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,275,000.  At this point, accepting John's offer of $1,200,000 makes the most financial sense."
