"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $175 is far above his maximum budget of $100. It's better to try negotiating with Alice or explore the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to buy the product for his maximum budget of $100. This is a bold counteroffer, but it establishes his price point and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  He should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  He still has the option to buy from John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

Bob is steadily increasing his offer while staying within his budget.  $120 is a compromise that acknowledges Alice's need to make some profit, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still above Bob's budget. He should continue to try and negotiate a lower price. He still has the option to buy from John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer while staying within his budget.  $130 is a compromise that acknowledges Alice's need to make some profit, but still leaves room for further negotiation. Since Alice has rejected his offer of $120, he is increasing his offer by $10 to show that he is willing to negotiate but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still too high for Bob. He has only 3 rounds left and it's unlikely he'll be able to get the price down to his desired $100.  Buying from John guarantees him the product at his desired price."
