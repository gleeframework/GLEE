Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $7,900 is still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a minimum of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I can offer you $8,500 again, but this is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason: Alice seems firm on her bottom line of $8,500.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and we're running out of rounds. Buying from John for $12,000, while not ideal, guarantees we get the product and avoids the risk of Alice not budging further."
