Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was hoping to negotiate the price down a bit. Could we agree on $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price, so it's worth trying to negotiate further. You can likely get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident you'll find this [product name] to be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe we could still reach an agreement closer to my initial offer. How about considering $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $130 is close to your desired price and higher than what John would pay.  It's worth accepting and closing the deal."
