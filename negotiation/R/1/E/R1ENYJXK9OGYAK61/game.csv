"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $750,000 if you're willing to negotiate further.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product offers is truly significant. How about we meet closer to the middle at $875,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to consider it. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",825000.0,Bob,4,
