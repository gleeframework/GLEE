"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,200,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly less than my initial ask. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's serious about the product. I'll aim to negotiate closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,200,000 is a significant departure from my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating ongoing interest. I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. We are getting close to my baseline, though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair deal considering the product's unique value.  What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,220,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $1,220,000 makes the most sense at this point:

* **Profitable:** It's still a $220,000 profit over my minimum and significantly more than John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging on negotiations has diminishing returns. Accepting now secures the deal.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob's smaller increments suggest he might be nearing his maximum price.

It's always tough leaving some money on the table, but a profitable and timely deal is preferable to risking a stalemate."
