Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the full $1,200,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market and the benefits of the product.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and I'm not willing to go lower than John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000."
