"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the features of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product goes beyond the standard market considerations. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000.  This reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the full $1,200,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market and the benefits of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
