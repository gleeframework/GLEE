"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. This sets the stage for a potentially successful deal while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my target price.  The negotiation is still early, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target. This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while gradually bridging the gap between our desired prices."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I initially aimed for a higher price, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep pushing. Accepting Bob's offer secures a deal for $1,000,000, which is a substantial profit and significantly higher than selling to John.  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of losing the deal to Bob or being forced to sell to John at a lower price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
