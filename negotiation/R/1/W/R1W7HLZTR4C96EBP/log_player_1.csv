Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a healthy margin above my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to Bob, and I'm hoping he'll see the value in my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will entice him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  However, I'm not confident we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. To avoid risking further negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
