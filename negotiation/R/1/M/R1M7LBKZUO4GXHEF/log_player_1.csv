Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $120 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100. Offering it slightly below your minimum ($120) might entice him while still giving you a profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy it for $120 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't have to go below her minimum.

By offering the product at $119, Alice aims to:

1. **Secure a Sale:** Bob might find the $19 discount appealing and buy it. 
2. **Maximize Earnings:** If Bob declines, Alice can still sell it to John for her minimum acceptable price."
