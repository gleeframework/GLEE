Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $950,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant profit for you and a good deal for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
