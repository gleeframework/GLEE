"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value I place on the product and the value you place on it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
