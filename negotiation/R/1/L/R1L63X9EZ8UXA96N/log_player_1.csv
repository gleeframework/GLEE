Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know you see its value.  I'm willing to make this deal work for both of us.  How about a price of $925,000?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying above John's offer.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  A price closer to the middle ground makes it more likely Bob will consider the offer seriously. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While aiming high, demanding a price too close to $1,000,000 might make Bob walk away, even if he values the product highly."
