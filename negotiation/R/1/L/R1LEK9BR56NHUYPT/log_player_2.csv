"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than our $800,000 limit and even beyond Alice's own valuation of the product.  We should counter with a much lower offer to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way above my budget. This product holds value for me, but closer to the $600,000 range. Would that be something you'd consider?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the value this product can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than our budget. We need to show her we're serious but won't budge too far too quickly. Let's see if we can entice her to move closer to our range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we have different valuations in mind. To help me understand your perspective better, could you elaborate on how you see this product benefiting your business? Knowing your planned use might help me tailor my offer and find a mutually beneficial price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is trying to understand our position better, but her price is still too high. We need to hold firm and show her we have a serious, but limited, budget. Let's nudge our offer up slightly to demonstrate willingness but maintain we're nearing our limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right that our valuations differ. To be transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $800,000.  I can see it being a valuable asset, and I'm willing to offer you $750,000.  This is a strong offer, and I hope we can find an agreement."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've reviewed everything carefully, and to ensure neither of us misses out on this opportunity, I'm making you a final offer. I'm willing to close the deal at $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value this product will bring to your business in the long run. Let's make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is a tough one, but Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her ""final offer"". It's a good deal compared to her previous offers, but it's still $200,000 over our absolute limit.  At this point, the best course of action is to buy from John for $800,000. We achieve our goal of acquiring the product while staying within our budget."
