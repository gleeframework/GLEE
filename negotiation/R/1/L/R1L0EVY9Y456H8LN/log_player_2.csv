# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $14,000.  While she might budge a little, it's not worth the risk of her holding firm and forcing you to accept a price closer to $14,000 or lose the deal entirely.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000. It's time to cut your losses and take the sure thing."
