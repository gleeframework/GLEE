Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be fair, I could come down to $120, which is the absolute lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $120 is her lowest price. This price exceeds your $100 limit.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
