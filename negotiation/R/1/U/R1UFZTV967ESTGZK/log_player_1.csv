Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $15,000 allows for potential negotiation down while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions it as an ""investment,"" appealing to Bob's potential desire for a good deal.
* **Exclusivity:** By mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing, you create a sense of urgency and priority.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have some time flexibility. If you need to sell quickly, a lower initial offer might be more suitable. 
* Bob's negotiation style and your relationship with him (if any) could influence your approach."
