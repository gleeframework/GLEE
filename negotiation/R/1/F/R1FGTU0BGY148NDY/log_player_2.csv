"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [product description] for a price of $2000000. This product is worth significantly more to me, but I'm confident it holds great value for you as well. Let's start the conversation! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  I need to negotiate a much lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start the negotiation process and hopefully get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value the product holds for me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,750,000 is still above my budget, but it's closer than her initial offer. I'm confident that we can negotiate further to reach a price closer to my target.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer again and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end.  This offer is fair considering my budget and the potential value of the product for me.  Let's find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still not close to what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000 as a final offer.  This price reflects the value and potential of this product. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point.  I'm confident that further negotiation can bring the price down even further.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer again and see if I can get closer to my target of $1,200,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000 as my final offer. This price reflects the value of the product for me and my maximum possible investment. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
