{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [product description] for a price of $2,000,000. This product is worth significantly more to me, but I'm confident it holds great value for you as well. Let's start the conversation!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value the product holds for me. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'll counter offer, but if he doesn't get closer to my desired price, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1750000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which represents a significant compromise on my end.  This offer is fair considering my budget and the potential value of the product for me.  Let's find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  I'll try one more counteroffer, but if he doesn't come up, I'm selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still not close to what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 as a final offer.  This price reflects the value and potential of this product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1600000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1350000 as my final offer. This price reflects the value of the product for me and my maximum possible investment. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum price, and with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer outweighs the potential gains.  I'm going to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $1,500,000."
