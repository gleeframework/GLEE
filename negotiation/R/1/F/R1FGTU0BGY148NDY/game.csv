"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [product description] for a price of $2000000. This product is worth significantly more to me, but I'm confident it holds great value for you as well. Let's start the conversation!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value the product holds for me. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1750000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which represents a significant compromise on my end.  This offer is fair considering my budget and the potential value of the product for me.  Let's find a common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still not close to what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000 as a final offer.  This price reflects the value and potential of this product. Let's finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1600000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1350000 as my final offer. This price reflects the value of the product for me and my maximum possible investment. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
