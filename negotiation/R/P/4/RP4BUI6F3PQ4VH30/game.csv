"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. The product seems like a great value, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This reflects the value it would bring you while still being a fair deal for me.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has value, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $18,000. Would you be willing to consider $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
