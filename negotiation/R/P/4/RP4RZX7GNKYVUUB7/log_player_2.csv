"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,000,000, which is a very competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, I want to try and get a better price.  Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer will allow me to explore if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my initial counteroffer.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more savings. Rejecting and counteroffering again allows me to continue negotiating without having to buy from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $925,000.  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. My revised offer is $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, I've already made a few counteroffers, and Alice has met me halfway each time.  $975,000 is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000.  There's always a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice might get impatient and I might have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer minimizes my risk and secures the product at a decent price."
