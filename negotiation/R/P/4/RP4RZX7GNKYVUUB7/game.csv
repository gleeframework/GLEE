"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,000,000, which is a very competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $925,000.  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. My revised offer is $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
