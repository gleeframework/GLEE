"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a reasonable price point. It's more than my minimum of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. I also want to keep the conversation friendly and see if Bob is interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my desired price point and is still higher than selling to John. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could lead to a lower price or even a failed deal."
