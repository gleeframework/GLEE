{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100 Offer:** This is a good starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Message:** Starting with a friendly greeting and offering a reason for Bob to be interested helps build rapport and encourages a more positive negotiation.

This offer allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also leaving space for a counteroffer from Bob if he finds the price too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is a good price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?"", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a price of $92.50 which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning:** I'm reminding Bob of his interest in the product and highlighting my willingness to be reasonable. 
* **Staying Above $80:** This counteroffer keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price.  

This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about a deal, but also that I'm not willing to give up too much profit.  I believe it's a good compromise that could lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we settle at $90 even? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counter-offer of $90 is very close to my ideal price. It's a fair compromise, and accepting it allows me to sell the product for a good profit while avoiding further negotiation. While I could potentially try to push for $92.50 again, there's a risk that Bob might walk away entirely or go back to his initial offer of $85.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the potential for a longer and more uncertain negotiation process."
