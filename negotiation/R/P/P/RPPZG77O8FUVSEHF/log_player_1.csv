``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would it be possible for you to consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I am willing to negotiate, but I will not settle for a price that undervalues my product. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable compromise."

Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  However, it's closer to my desired price than his previous offer. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a price that is closer to my minimum. I'm willing to be flexible, but I won't settle for a price that is too far below my minimum."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now within my acceptable range, considering my minimum price of $1,500,000 and John's offer of $1,500,000.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure the sale. Continuing negotiations could risk losing Bob as a buyer and potentially having to settle for John's offer."
