Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This offer represents a significant compromise from my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  It gives Bob a good deal while still securing a substantial profit for me. This should entice Bob to consider the offer seriously.  However, I'm prepared to counter his offers to ensure I get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to counter with a higher price, but I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob isn't willing to come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $975,000. This represents a compromise on my end while also leaving room for further negotiation. I'm confident this price will be attractive to Bob, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still not enough. I'm confident I can get a better price by selling to John, who's willing to pay my full asking price.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on that opportunity for a slightly lower price."
