It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, there's room for a better deal."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see if she's willing to come down a bit."

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $925,000 is still too high. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider John's offer."

I'm going to offer $910,000. This is a small step closer to Alice's last offer, but I'm hoping she sees that I'm serious about getting a good deal. If she doesn't budge, I might have to consider John's offer."

Alice is being stubborn, and we're getting closer to my maximum price. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation. John is a safe bet for $1,000,000, which is still within my budget."
