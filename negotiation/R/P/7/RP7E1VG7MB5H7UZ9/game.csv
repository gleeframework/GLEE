"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's find a way to make this work.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $80 is low, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $110.  It's a good middle ground, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
