Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000.  At this point, accepting John's offer of $800,000 makes more financial sense, even if it means losing out on further negotiation with Alice."
