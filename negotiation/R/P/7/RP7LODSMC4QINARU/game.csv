"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to pay $11,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this time.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However,  $11,250 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000, and I believe that's a fair price given the value of the product to both of us. Let's make a deal!",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,150. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1150.0,Alice,7,
