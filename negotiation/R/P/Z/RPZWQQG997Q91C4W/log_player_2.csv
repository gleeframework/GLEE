"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to give up and buy from John, as there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Alice.  I'll reject her offer and see if I can get her closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $10,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's asking price but represents a substantial step towards her. It shows I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will get the ball rolling and lead to a more agreeable price in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  It's a fantastic product and a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm still willing to negotiate further and see if I can get her closer to my desired price point of $8,000. I'll reject her offer and counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $12,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's a significant amount for me and still leaves you with a profit."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving closer to Alice's price point, but I'm still keeping it under $15,000 (her minimum value). I'm highlighting the benefit for both of us with my offer, and I'm hopeful that this will persuade her to accept."
