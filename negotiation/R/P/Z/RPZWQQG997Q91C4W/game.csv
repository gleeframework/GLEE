"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  It's a fantastic product and a fair price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $12,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's a significant amount for me and still leaves you with a profit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
