"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $22,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $22,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This product truly is worth the investment, and I'm confident you'll see a return on it."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still not comfortable with $18,000. I'm willing to go to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

We're still significantly below John's offer. It's time to push Bob a bit more and see if he's really willing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still quite a ways away from what I had in mind.  To be frank, I have another buyer who's interested at a higher price point.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to see some serious movement. How about $16,000? That's a compromise I'm willing to make."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $13,000, which is a significant move on my part.  I think this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $13,000 offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
