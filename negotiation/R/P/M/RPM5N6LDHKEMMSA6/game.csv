"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start the conversation. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $22,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $22,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This product truly is worth the investment, and I'm confident you'll see a return on it.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still not comfortable with $18,000. I'm willing to go to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still quite a ways away from what I had in mind.  To be frank, I have another buyer who's interested at a higher price point.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to see some serious movement. How about $16,000? That's a compromise I'm willing to make.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $13,000, which is a significant move on my part.  I think this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",13000.0,Bob,6,
