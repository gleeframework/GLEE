Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price given its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's estimated value of $15,000, allowing for potential counteroffers. 
* **It's a reasonable price:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but still value your product.

By starting with this offer, you maximize your chances of getting a good price while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $13,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still below your ideal target.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and push for a higher price in a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to craft a counteroffer that's higher than $13,000, but still below your ideal price point.  Consider offering something in the range of $13,500.  This shows you're willing to negotiate, but also that you believe the product's worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $13,500.  This product is unique and very valuable, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit of this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Increase the price:**  It's higher than Bob's offer, moving the negotiation closer to your ideal price point.
* **Maintain room for negotiation:** It's still below your ideal price and leaves space for Bob to counteroffer again if he needs to.
* **Reiterate the value:**  The message emphasizes the product's unique value and encourages Bob to see its worth. 

By offering $13,500, you're showing you're willing to negotiate while still staying firm on your position that the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $13,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,250 is very close to your ideal price point and is definitely a good deal. You've already rejected Bob's lower offer, so this offer shows progress in the negotiation. 

It's worth considering these factors:

* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While you could try to counteroffer for a slightly higher price, there's a chance Bob might walk away. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming, and this offer is already a strong outcome. 
* **Security of Sale:** Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of Bob completely rejecting your counteroffer or you needing to sell to John at a lower price.

**Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $13,250 is the most strategic decision in this scenario.**"
