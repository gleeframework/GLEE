"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is much higher. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring if a better price can be achieved."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential benefits it offers to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than her perceived value of the product ($800,000). There is still room for negotiation to try and get a lower price.  While buying from John is always an option, it's worth exploring if a better deal can be made with Alice first."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential benefits it offers to you. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming closer to your desired price, she's still above the sweet spot.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if a better price can be achieved.  If you keep rejecting offers, you can likely get her down to a more agreeable price point.  However, keep in mind that John's offer is always an option if things don't work out."

Round 6

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $912,500 is still a bit higher than you'd like.  It's worth seeing if you can get her down a little further with another counteroffer.  John's offer is always an option if things don't work out.  With only a few rounds left, it's time to push for a price you're comfortable with."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to your ideal price, but she's still not quite there, and we are at the penultimate round.  Given the risk of not reaching an agreement and the potential loss of the product to John, it's time to cut your losses and buy from John. While this is a higher price than desired, it's still within your budget and guarantees you get the product."
