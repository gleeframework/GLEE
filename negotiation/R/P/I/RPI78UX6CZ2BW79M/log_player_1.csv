Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great value at this price, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:** Starting high allows room for negotiation.  While $200 is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, it gives you space to potentially come down in price while still exceeding your minimum selling price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $60 is far below both your valuation and your starting offer. Accepting would result in a significant loss. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price, even if it means eventually selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but stay strong:**  We're acknowledging Bob's offer but countering with a price significantly higher. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $130 is still above your minimum ($150), giving you room to negotiate further while aiming to maximize profit. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counter-offer helps gauge Bob's flexibility and how serious he is about purchasing the item."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer increased slightly, but it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. It's time to show you're serious about your valuation and that you have other options.  Continuing to negotiate at this level is unlikely to result in a price you find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $75.  This item is worth considerably more to me, and I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. My best offer is $110, and I won't be able to go any lower. "", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This signals to Bob that you're nearing the end of your negotiation willingness. 
* **Justify Your Price:** You're re-emphasizing the value of the item and the presence of another buyer to strengthen your position. 
* **Slight Concession:** By coming down to $110, you're showing a bit more flexibility but staying firmly above your absolute minimum.  

This counteroffer aims to either secure a price closer to your goal or prompt Bob to reveal how much he's truly willing to spend."
