"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and still make a good profit. I'm also highlighting the value to Bob to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a slight reduction from my initial price, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target. I'm also emphasizing the value for Bob to push him towards acceptance."
