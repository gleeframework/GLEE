Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have a strong position to aim high initially. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  A significantly higher offer (in this case, a 50% increase) allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potential price ceiling.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This high price leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you a clearer understanding of his valuation while staying well above your minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** While not provided in the prompt, real-world negotiations often involve researching comparable products and market values to support your pricing strategy. 
* **Bob's Profile:** Knowing more about Bob (his business, his needs, his negotiation style) would help tailor a more effective offer."
