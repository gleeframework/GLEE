Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can reach a deal.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While that price doesn't quite work for me, I am open to finding a solution that benefits us both. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.

You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer, it's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
