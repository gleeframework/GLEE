,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, how about $10500? This price reflects the value you'll get out of the product, and it's a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
