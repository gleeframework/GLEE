"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the potential value for Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, this offer is too low.
* **Proceed to the next round:** I have several rounds left and can continue to negotiate with Bob. I'm hopeful that we can find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, how about $10,500? This price reflects the value you'll get out of the product, and it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $10,500. This is still above Bob's initial offer but significantly closer to his perceived value. It shows my willingness to negotiate while still securing a profit.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's position but reiterate my own. I emphasize the value Bob will get out of the product and frame the price as a fair compromise. This approach aims to maintain a positive relationship and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accept Bob's offer:** $10,000 is a good deal. While it's below my ideal selling price, it's a fair price that ensures a profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  There's a risk that continued negotiation might lead to further price reductions or a stalemate. 
* **Selling to John:** While John offers a higher price, I'm confident I can secure a similar price with Bob. 

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a profitable sale."
