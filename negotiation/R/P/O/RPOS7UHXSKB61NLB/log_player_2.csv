"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get an incredible deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is now matching John's price, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal from her with further negotiation.  It's time to accept and avoid potentially missing out on the product entirely."
