Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000? I think that's a fair price that would benefit both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
