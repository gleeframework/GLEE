"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to  $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but I'm looking for a price closer to $950,000.  This offer reflects the product's potential and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a middle ground. However, $750,000 is still a significant gap from what I have in mind.  Let's try $850,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
