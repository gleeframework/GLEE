"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $950,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you consider $975,000 for the product? It's still within your range, but closer to what I'm comfortable with financially.",975000.0,Bob,4,
