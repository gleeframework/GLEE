Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm aiming for a price close to the middle of our value ranges, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going for a ""take it or leave it"" approach, acknowledging that Bob might have a lower offer in mind. 

This strategy balances the desire for a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. I'm prepared to counter-offer if necessary, but I'll also be ready to switch to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than $8,000 from John, I'm still willing to hold out for a higher price. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and I believe there's room for a compromise closer to my desired price range. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell you the product for $11,000. That's still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price in the middle of our last two offers, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this price is still a great deal for him, incentivizing acceptance.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language (""great value"", ""closer to what I'm looking for"") to keep the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually acceptable price while still ensuring I get a better deal than selling to John."
