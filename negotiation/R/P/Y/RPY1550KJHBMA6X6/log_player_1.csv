"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's estimated value. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn a good profit. I'm also keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going down a bit from my initial offer but still staying above Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a decent profit margin. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $10,000, which is a good compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and  represents a significant profit.  It's better to take this offer rather than risking further negotiation and possibly ending up with a lower price or even having to sell to John for $8,000."
