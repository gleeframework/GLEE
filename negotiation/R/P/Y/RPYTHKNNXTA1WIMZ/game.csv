"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, the product's value is substantial, and I can't go as low as $1,100,000.  Would you consider $1,300,000?  I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
