Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I can't let it go for less than $130. I'm confident it's worth it!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down, but we still have room to negotiate.  We're getting closer to John's price, and it's worth seeing if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference** is a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and a desire to reach an agreement. 
*  We are still aiming for a price below John's offer of $100, but this offer gives Alice room to counter if she's absolutely unwilling to go that low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting close!  I could come down to $125, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to go lower:**  She stated ""$125 is my final offer.""  While this could be a negotiation tactic, it's risky to assume she'll change her mind.
* **John offers a guaranteed better price:**  We know we can get the product for $100 from John. It's not worth the risk of trying to haggle Alice down another $25, potentially failing, and missing out on both deals."
