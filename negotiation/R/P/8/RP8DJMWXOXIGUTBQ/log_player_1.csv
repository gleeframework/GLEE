Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'll only accept offers at or below this price.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range can potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but there are a few things to consider:

* **Bob's Information:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.  
* **Relationship:**  A strong relationship with Bob might make you consider a slightly lower price for future business opportunities. 

**The Offer**

Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  Starting with a positive and assertive tone sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 is a strong opening within the ZOPA. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **No Justification:** Avoid revealing why you've chosen this price. Let Bob respond first.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob will likely counter-offer.  Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **Walk Away Point:** Remember, you have a guaranteed offer from John. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet you at a price that benefits you."
