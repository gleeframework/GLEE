,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll receive. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair offer, as it's closer to your desired price than my previous offer and still within my budget.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for you and is within a range I'm comfortable with.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
