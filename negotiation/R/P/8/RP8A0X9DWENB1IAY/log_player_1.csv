"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll receive. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair offer, as it's closer to your desired price than my previous offer and still within my budget.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than before, it's still far below the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, it's still far too low for me.  I'm not giving up on getting a price closer to my target, and I'm confident that we can still reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll send him a counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already spent several rounds negotiating and I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it's the best option for me at this point."
