"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a decent price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $850,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $950,000.  This is still within my budget and hopefully, it's a price that Alice will be willing to consider, given she values the product at $1,200,000.  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's clear that further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.  Therefore, I'm choosing to buy the product from John for $800,000 to ensure I stay within my budget."
