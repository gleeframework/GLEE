"Alice, while I see the value in this product,  $1,450,000 is a bit more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product can bring significant value to your operations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
