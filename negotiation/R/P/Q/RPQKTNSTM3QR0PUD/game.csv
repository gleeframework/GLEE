"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product but $10,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,750. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's meet in the middle.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,750 is close, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we settle at $10,000? This would be a win-win, providing you with a fantastic product at a fair price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there with $10,000.  I'm happy to go up to $9,850.  This is a fair offer that's closer to my budget and still provides you with a good profit.  Let's make a deal.",9850.0,Bob,6,
