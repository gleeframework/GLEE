Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and I know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:**  By offering a price that's not your full asking price, you demonstrate flexibility. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still keeping Bob interested in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to me. However, I would like to propose a lower price of $13,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is still more than your minimum, you can likely get a better price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you show him that you're serious about getting closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,200. This price reflects both the value of the product to me and your original asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for you. You're getting $13,200, which is $1,200 more than what John is offering. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Bob won't budge much more, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
