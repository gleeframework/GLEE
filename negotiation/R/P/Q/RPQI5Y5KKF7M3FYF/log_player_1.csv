This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for potential negotiation. It also emphasizes the value to Bob, encouraging him to see the deal as beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that price. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is a tempting price, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,350,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, $1,350,000 is a reasonable compromise and significantly better than selling to John. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful sale with a good profit."
