"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I believe it's a valuable asset for your business, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. My initial price is $1200000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe it's a fair starting point considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I was thinking of a price more in the range of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $900000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1050000. This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on the product's value.  I'm open to further discussion but believe this is a reasonable starting point for our next round of negotiation.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think a price of $950000 is more reasonable. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down further to $1000000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's work together to close this deal and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think a price of $975000 is more reasonable. I'm getting close to my budget, but I need to stay within it. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $975000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go as low as $990000. This is a significant discount from my previous offer and gets us very close to a deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away. I'm confident this product will be a game-changer for your business, and I want to make this work for both of us.",990000.0,Alice,7,
