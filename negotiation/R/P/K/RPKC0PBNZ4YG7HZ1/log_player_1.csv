Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford at this time.  If you're willing to consider this, I believe we can finalize a deal.  Let me know your thoughts.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price point close enough to my minimum.  John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a significant amount more than Bob's current offer and ensures I don't waste more time negotiating for a lower price."
