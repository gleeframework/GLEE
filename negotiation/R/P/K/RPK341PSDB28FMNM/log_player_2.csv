"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price but higher than her product valuation. This strategy aims to:

* **Signal Flexibility:** We're willing to negotiate, showing Alice we're interested.
* **Establish a Lower Anchor:** By starting low, we try to influence Alice's perception of a fair price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  We anticipate Alice might counter, and offering $70 leaves us space to increase our bid gradually."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still well below what the product is worth to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to her valuation, but $85 is still above her known value for the product. We can likely negotiate further since we have ample room within our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We show Alice we're willing to move, but only slightly. An $8 increase from our previous offer shows good faith without giving up too much ground.
* **Aiming Slightly Above Midpoint:** The exact midpoint between our last offer ($70) and her counter ($85) is $77.50. We aim slightly above to leave ourselves room for a final small concession, potentially around $80,  if needed. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By staying firm and not jumping too high, we incentivize Alice to potentially settle closer to her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to drop my price to $82, which is a fair compromise. Let's seal the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is making concessions, but the pace is slow. She's likely testing our willingness to pay more. By continuing to reject offers slightly above her valuation, we signal our intent to get a price closer to $80. We'll use our next counteroffer to apply more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I can go up to $80, but that's really the most I can do. It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Our Limit:** We're at Alice's known valuation. Offering any more would mean paying above what we know she values the product at, which isn't strategically sound.
* **Firm but Fair Tone:**  We want to convey that this isn't a negotiation tactic â€“ it's our genuine limit. The message emphasizes fairness and our readiness to buy immediately.
* **Introducing Time Pressure:**  By stating we're ready to close, we subtly introduce a time element. Alice has to decide if she'll risk losing the sale over a few dollars."
