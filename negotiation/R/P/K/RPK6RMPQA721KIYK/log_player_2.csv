"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $10,500.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $11,000 is closer to his target, it's still higher than his ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $10,750. This feels like a fair compromise, considering our previous offers."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,750 is closer to what I'm looking for, I need to get a bit more. Would you consider $10,900?  That's a small adjustment, and it would help me feel good about this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $10,900 is very close to Bob's ideal price of $10,000. It's a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Limited Rounds:**  The negotiation is already halfway through.  Continuing to reject offers might risk losing Alice and forcing Bob to pay the higher price from John.
* **Potential for Compromise:** While Bob could counteroffer, it's likely Alice will be firm at this point. Accepting the offer ensures a deal at a reasonable price."
