Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $10,500.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.
