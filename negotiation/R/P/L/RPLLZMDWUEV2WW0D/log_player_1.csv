"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, aiming for a profitable margin. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Leaving room for negotiation allows Bob to make a counteroffer, potentially leading to a deal that benefits both of us."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  I believe there's room for negotiation and a deal that benefits both of us.  I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the counteroffer. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Fair Price:** $115 is still above my minimum price point, but it's a reasonable compromise, potentially leading to a quick deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Still Below Minimum:** $107 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe that by continuing to negotiate, I can potentially push Bob closer to my desired price. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  While there are still rounds left, I want to ensure I get the best price possible before resorting to selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $107. Let's try $111.  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 111}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing the offer by a small amount, showing a willingness to budge but not giving in completely.
* **Fair Compromise:** I believe $111 represents a fair compromise point, closer to Bob's desired price while still being above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $109 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing the price slightly, demonstrating flexibility without drastically changing the offer.
