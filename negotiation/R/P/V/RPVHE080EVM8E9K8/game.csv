"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about we start the conversation at $850,000 and see if we can find some common ground?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential to benefit your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value at $1,100,000, I need to stay closer to my budget.  Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. I believe the product's value to you is worth this amount, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
