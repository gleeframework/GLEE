Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth to someone in your position, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its potential impact for you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit beyond John's $800,000 offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $925,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still securing a significant gain over selling to John.
* **Confident Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price."
