"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's inherent worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
