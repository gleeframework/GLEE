"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I have to inform you that I've received interest from another buyer who is willing to pay a premium for the product. That being said, I'm willing to start the conversation with an initial offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my interest in the product, Alice. I appreciate your transparency regarding the other buyer's offer. While I understand the value you place on the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. This price aligns more closely with my budget while still acknowledging the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to inform you that the product is a unique item, and its value is not easily replicable. Considering the other buyer's interest and the value you've placed on it, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1150000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, while also acknowledging the premium I've received from the other buyer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the value you've placed on the product and the premium I've received from the other buyer, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1200000, which is $50000 more than my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account your budget constraints.
