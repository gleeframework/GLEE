Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** I want to get as much as possible, so starting at $100 is a waste of potential profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $125 is still a good deal for Bob, leaving him with a $25 profit margin. This makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  A price in the middle is a good starting point for negotiations. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
