"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential return on investment for you. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This price reflects my budget and my expectations for the product's value. Can we meet in the middle?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,300,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal and recognizes the value you see in the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm thinking $1,275,000 is a fair price for the product. I believe it's a good compromise that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
