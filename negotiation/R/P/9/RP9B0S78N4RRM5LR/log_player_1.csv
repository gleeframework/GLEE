Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer itself:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so don't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer or your minimum price.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that $300,000 surplus as possible without alienating Bob. Here's a strategy:

1. **Confident Opening:** Start with an offer closer to Bob's perceived value.
2. **Justification:** Provide a reason for the high price (unique features, market demand, etc.).
3. **Leave Room:**  Don't start at Bob's absolute maximum, leave space for him to potentially counter-offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm confident it will deliver significant value to your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Confident Tone:**  Using phrases like ""exceptional product"" and ""confident it will deliver"" conveys value.
* **High Opening:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""unique features and market potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds it slightly too high.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. He might outright accept, counter-offer, or try to negotiate further."
