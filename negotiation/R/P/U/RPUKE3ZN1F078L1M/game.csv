"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, but my price reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet halfway at $1,325,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
