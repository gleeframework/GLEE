**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" is still significantly higher than your alternative option with John. You've made it clear you're willing to pay a reasonable price, but Alice seems anchored closer to her valuation.  At this point, cutting your losses and going with John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
