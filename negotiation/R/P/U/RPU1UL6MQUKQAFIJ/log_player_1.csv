Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, so I won't sell it for less.
* **Potential upside:**  There's a chance Bob values the product even more than me. By offering $1,500,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation and potentially earning a higher profit.
* **John as backup:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000. This makes me comfortable taking a risk with Bob. 

This offer balances the need to maximize my potential earnings with the reality of having a guaranteed backup offer."
