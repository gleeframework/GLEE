"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product, it looks great. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
