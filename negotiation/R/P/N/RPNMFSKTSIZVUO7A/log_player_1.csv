Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting Bob's current offer would mean a $22.50 loss compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
