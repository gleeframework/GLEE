# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll reap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, but only $800,000 to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer of $1,100,000 allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation and Bob can potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
