Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while staying significantly above Bob's valuation.  
* **Backup plan ensures a good outcome:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John.
* **Aiming for the highest possible profit:** This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
