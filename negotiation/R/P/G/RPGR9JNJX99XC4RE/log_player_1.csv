"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you.  I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm highlighting that the product is likely worth a lot to him, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message clearly indicates I'm open to negotiation, which can help keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $95. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum than his first offer, it's still below the $80 I'm comfortable with. 
* **Room for improvement:**  I believe there's still potential to get a higher price. I want to see if I can push him up further.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  While John's offer is my absolute minimum, I don't want to settle for that just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight decrease:** I'm lowering my price, showing flexibility, but not drastically.
* **Emphasize value and deal:**  I'm still pointing out the product's value and how my counteroffer is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Keep negotiations moving:**  This counteroffer aims to keep the dialogue going and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
