Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, knowing he might be willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $11,000 is a good starting point, giving me room to lower the price if necessary.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 provides security if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** I cannot accept $9,000 as it's below my minimum threshold of $10,000.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **John as backup:**  Having John as a backup option ensures I won't lose out completely if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I'm providing a reason (meeting halfway) to make the counteroffer seem fair.
* **Staying above the minimum:** $9,500 is above my $10,000 minimum, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and shows I'm willing to work with Bob to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $9,200 is still below my $10,000 minimum.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks further concessions, potentially lowering the price below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees a secure profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations.

I'm choosing to take the safe option and sell to John to avoid potentially ending up with a lower price."
