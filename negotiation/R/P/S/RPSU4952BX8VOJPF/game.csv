"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm ready to pay $105 for it. What do you say?",105.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $108. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better one elsewhere!",108.0,Alice,3,
