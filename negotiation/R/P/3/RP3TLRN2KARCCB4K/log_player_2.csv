**Reasoning:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has consistently met me in the middle.  At this point, the potential savings of another $10,000 are not worth the risk of Alice pulling out of the deal or me running out of rounds. This price is significantly lower than John's offer, making it a good deal overall."
