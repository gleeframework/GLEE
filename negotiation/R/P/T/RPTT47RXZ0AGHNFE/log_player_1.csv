{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $120 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  The offer is not too aggressive, giving Bob the impression that you're open to negotiation. 

By starting at $120, you create an opportunity for a win-win scenario where you can potentially earn more than your minimum and Bob gets a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is still lower than the initial offer, accepting it allows you to secure a deal and earn a profit of $30.  It's also a good compromise considering his counter-offer was also a compromise. 

The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Bob might back out or lower his offer further, making it not worth the risk. It's important to consider the potential for a future negotiation, but in this case,  accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and profit."
