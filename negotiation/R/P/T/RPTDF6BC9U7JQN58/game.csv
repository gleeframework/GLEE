"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a significant amount to you. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is closer to your budget while still reflecting the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still reasonable, considering the value you'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
