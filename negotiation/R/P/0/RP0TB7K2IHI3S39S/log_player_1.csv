Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counter-offers, while still maximizing potential profit.  It's also a strong opening position that might encourage Bob to take the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what I'd get from John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will allow me to continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a good price. It's above my baseline of $1,000,000 from John and a reasonable compromise after our negotiations.  I'll accept his offer."
