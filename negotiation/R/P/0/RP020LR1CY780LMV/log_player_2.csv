{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer has increased again, which is not ideal. However, with only 5 rounds left, it's still worth continuing to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is getting closer to my maximum budget of $120. However, with only three rounds left, the likelihood of getting a better price from Alice is decreasing. It's better to secure the product from John at $120 to avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
