"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, but I'm still interested in making a deal with you. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is the highest I can go without losing too much value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",950000.0,Alice,5,
