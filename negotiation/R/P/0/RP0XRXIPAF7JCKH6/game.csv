"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you know it's worth a lot more than that. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1200000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1700000? This would still be a great deal for you, given the product's value. Let's see if we can work something out.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, though.  How about $1550000? This would be a significant saving for you compared to the value of the product, and it would be much closer to my minimum. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
