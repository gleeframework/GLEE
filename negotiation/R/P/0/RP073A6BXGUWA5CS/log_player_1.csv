"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $12,000 is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000, leaving space for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000 and also below my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:** There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob or secure the full $15,000 from John. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and show him I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great price for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob to justify my price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message maintains a friendly tone and encourages further discussion, signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, $10,000 is still significantly below the value of the product to me.  
* **Time for a Counteroffer:**  I still have several rounds left and believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I demonstrate that I am willing to walk away if necessary, which might encourage Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. This is a great price for you, and it allows me to earn a fair return on the product.  Let's close this deal,  what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small concession ($250) from my previous offer. This shows flexibility without compromising too much.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I reiterate the value of the product and emphasize that my offer is a fair price for both of us.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  ""Let's close this deal"" suggests that I'm ready to finalize the transaction and encourages Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, $9,750 is still below the value of the product to me.  
* **Time for a Counteroffer:**  I still have several rounds left and believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I demonstrate that I am willing to walk away if necessary, which might encourage Bob to increase his offer. 
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:** If I don't reach a satisfactory price with Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to close this deal. This is a great price for you, and it's the best I can offer. Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  ""Let's finalize this now"" conveys a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Emphasis on Finality:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, making it more likely that Bob will accept.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $10,000 is still above my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my final offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  I only have two rounds left, and it's unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer.
* **John Offers a Guaranteed Price:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose money on the deal.

By selling to John, I can secure a certain profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower final price."
