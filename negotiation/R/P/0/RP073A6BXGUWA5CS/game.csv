"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great price for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. This is a great price for you, and it allows me to earn a fair return on the product.  Let's close this deal,  what do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can make a deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to close this deal. This is a great price for you, and it's the best I can offer. Let's finalize this now.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my final offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,8,
