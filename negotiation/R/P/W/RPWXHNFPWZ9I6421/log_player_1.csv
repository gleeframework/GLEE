"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product. My starting price is $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think we can reach a more agreeable price. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm willing to risk a few more rejections to see if I can reach a higher price.  Also, selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a profit, but I'm aiming for a higher amount if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I need to see a more substantial offer. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to lower my price to $875,000. This still gives you a significant profit margin, and it allows me to get closer to my target. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for both of us. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I'd love to get more, it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to him. I've already rejected his lower offer, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of a potential stalemate or losing out to John."
