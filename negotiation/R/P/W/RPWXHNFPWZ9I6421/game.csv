"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think we can reach a more agreeable price. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I need to see a more substantial offer. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to lower my price to $875,000. This still gives you a significant profit margin, and it allows me to get closer to my target. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for both of us. Looking forward to your response.",800000.0,Bob,4,
