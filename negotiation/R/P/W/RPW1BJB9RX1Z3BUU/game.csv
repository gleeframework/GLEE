"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the price I'm willing to accept.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement.  What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still trying to save some money, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can see the value in making a deal at this price.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,250 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's make a deal and move forward.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point of no return, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious concession, but I need to know that you're willing to meet me halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $9,500, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,7,
