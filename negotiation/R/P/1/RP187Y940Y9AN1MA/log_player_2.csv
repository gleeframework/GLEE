"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a product that's worth its weight in gold.  I know this product is worth $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Consider this your exclusive chance to own it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer is only $1 less than what Bob would pay John, it's still a better deal and saves Bob $1."
