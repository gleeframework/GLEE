Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you considerable resources in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000 provides leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who values the product more, while remaining aware of the backup option with John."
