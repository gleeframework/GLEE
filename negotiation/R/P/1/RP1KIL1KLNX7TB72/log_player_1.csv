Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000. This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm confident that I can secure a good price, as the product is worth the same to Bob.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further or  sell to John for my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is below my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and come up to meet my price.  I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't, as I have another buyer waiting."
