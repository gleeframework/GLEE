"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of similar products. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: $900,000 is still a relatively high price for Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:  Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John at a significantly higher price. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
