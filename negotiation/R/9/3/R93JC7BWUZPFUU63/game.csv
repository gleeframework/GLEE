"Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to pay $800000 at this time.  This is my best and final offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1000000 to facilitate this deal. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll gain from this product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1000000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm ready to close the deal at $850000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm prepared to purchase it immediately.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,4,
