{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a decent starting point, allowing for potential negotiation while still securing a profit for myself.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is my minimum,  I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still gives me a profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  Even though I'm close to my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's a guaranteed deal and I don't want to risk haggling with Bob further."
