"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, $1,400,000 undervalues what it brings to the table. Could we agree on $1,800,000? I'm confident it will more than prove its worth at that price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
