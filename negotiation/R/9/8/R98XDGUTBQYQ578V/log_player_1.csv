Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer Alice could make, considering her goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $11,500, given its worth. Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000.  She wants to capture as much of that value as possible, aiming for a price significantly higher than her minimum ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $11,500 is ambitious, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly and still feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Going straight for $12,000 might seem too aggressive and could cause Bob to walk away. 
* **John as a Backup:** Alice has the security of John's offer, so she can afford to be a bit bolder with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Alice could try a different approach, such as a slightly lower opening price to encourage quicker acceptance."
