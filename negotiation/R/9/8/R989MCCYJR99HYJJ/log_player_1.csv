{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that could be a game-changer for your business. I'm asking for $2,000,000 for it, but I'm confident the value you'll gain from it will far exceed that price. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $1,500,000.  
* **Message:** The message is designed to pique Bob's interest and highlight the potential value of the product. I emphasize the unique opportunity and potential for a strong return on investment. 
* **Negotiation:** This offer sets the stage for potential negotiation. If Bob is interested, I'm prepared to discuss the price further based on his needs and budget. 

**Rationale:**

By starting with a higher price, I increase the potential for a higher profit. If Bob accepts, I achieve my goal. If he rejects, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of money. This strategy allows me to maximize my profit while minimizing risk."
