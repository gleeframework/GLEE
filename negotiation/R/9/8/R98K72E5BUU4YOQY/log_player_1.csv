I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's level of interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject it and counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a significant step down from my initial price, showing a willingness to compromise.  This hopefully will encourage Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While tempting, it's not worth risking a deal with John.  I'll counteroffer again."

I'm dropping the price again, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  It's important to keep the negotiation moving forward and I'm confident that Bob will be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle.  If not, I can always sell to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob seems unwilling to move up from $1,200,000.  This price is below my minimum, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob.  It's time to secure the deal with John for a price that meets my needs."
