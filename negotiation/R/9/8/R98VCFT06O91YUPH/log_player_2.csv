"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $11,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $10,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is low:**  While Bob could counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice will reject and the negotiation could drag on.  There's also the risk of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate further.
* **Jhon's offer is not a better alternative:**  Buying from Jhon would save $1,500, but it's important to remember that the negotiation with Alice is already quite favorable to Bob.  

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice, as it secures the product within Bob's budget without jeopardizing a potential deal."
