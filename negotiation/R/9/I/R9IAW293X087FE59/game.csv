"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $14,500.  How about we meet at $15,500?  That's a significant compromise on my part, and it's a price that reflects the true value of this product. It's a win-win situation, allowing you to get a great deal while also ensuring I can make a fair profit. Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
