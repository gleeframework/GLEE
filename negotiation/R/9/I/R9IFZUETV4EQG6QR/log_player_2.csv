"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob! This product is a game-changer, and I'm excited to share it with you. I'm thinking of a price of $180 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is too high.  It's more than my maximum budget. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is only $120. Would you be willing to negotiate a bit?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. I can see that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $160? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

While $160 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $160 is still above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but $140 is the absolute maximum I can do.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $140. How about we compromise at $155? It's a bit higher than your offer, but it's still a good deal for you, and I think it's worth it for the value this product provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $120. I don't want to risk going any higher, as I could end up paying more than I'm comfortable with.  I'll go with the guaranteed price from John."
