"I have a great opportunity for you, Bob! This product is a game-changer, and I'm excited to share it with you. I'm thinking of a price of $180 for it. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is only $120. Would you be willing to negotiate a bit?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. I can see that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $160? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $160 is still above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but $140 is the absolute maximum I can do.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $140. How about we compromise at $155? It's a bit higher than your offer, but it's still a good deal for you, and I think it's worth it for the value this product provides.",155.0,Alice,5,
