{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  While I cannot disclose the exact nature of it at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation. I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I'm leaving a buffer for potential concessions.
* **Building Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product without revealing specifics, creating intrigue and potentially piquing Bob's interest.
* **Opportunity:** I'm framing the offer as an ""opportunity"" to acquire a valuable asset, further emphasizing the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message leaves the door open for negotiation and encourages Bob to respond. 

By starting high and keeping the value proposition ambiguous, I aim to maximize my potential earnings while also allowing for a dynamic negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is a fair price considering your stated value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a higher price and see if he's willing to compromise. 

I'm not selling to John yet because I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob."
