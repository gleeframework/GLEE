"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  While I cannot disclose the exact nature of it at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is a fair price considering your stated value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this time. The value of this product is truly significant, and I believe $1250000 would be a fair reflection of its potential.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1250000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This represents a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product.  Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
