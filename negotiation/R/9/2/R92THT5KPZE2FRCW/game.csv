"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it, considering its unique features.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",750000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price that balances the value you're looking for with the product's worth. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit outside of my price range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $810000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",810000.0,Alice,5,,
