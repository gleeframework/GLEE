**Reasoning:**

We are now at $1,225,000.  Alice is very consistently meeting in the middle.  While we *might* be able to squeeze out another $25,000, it's risky. If Alice holds firm, we are rapidly approaching John's price and will lose our negotiating power.  It's a good deal and time to accept."
