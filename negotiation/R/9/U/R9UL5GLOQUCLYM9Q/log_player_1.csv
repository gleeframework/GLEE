"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. My starting price is $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down and still make a good profit. 
* **Appeal to Bob's interest:** I'm framing the message to highlight the value of the product for Bob, hoping to pique his interest and increase the likelihood of a deal. 
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Time to counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  Let's split the difference and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired profit margin. 
* **Appeal to fairness:**  Suggesting that we ""split the difference"" can appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him more inclined to accept. 
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm making it clear that I'm motivated to make a deal and am offering a price that's fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about $95? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my desired profit margin, and it's within a reasonable range for a compromise. 
* **Limited time:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's important to be strategic and avoid risking a potential sale. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** While I could potentially get a higher price in future rounds, there's also the risk that Bob might walk away, or the negotiations might stall. 

Selling for $95 ensures a decent profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
