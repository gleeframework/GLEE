"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I can get out of the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, to be candid, $750,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To move this forward, I could work with $875,000. This reflects the significant value I'm offering.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
