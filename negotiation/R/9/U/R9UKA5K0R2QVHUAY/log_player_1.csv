{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a decent markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price to $135. This is a compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a decent profit.  I think this is a fair price considering Bob's low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely or getting a lower offer from John.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
