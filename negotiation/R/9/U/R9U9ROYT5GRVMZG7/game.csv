"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $7,000?  That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $8,500? That's my best offer so far.",8500.0,Alice,5,
