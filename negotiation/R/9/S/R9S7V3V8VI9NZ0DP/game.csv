,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

I'm willing to meet you at $980000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?,980000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $980000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I've got to be honest with you, $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $1050000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
