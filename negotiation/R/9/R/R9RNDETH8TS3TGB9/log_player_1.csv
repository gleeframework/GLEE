Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you'd like."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he's very eager.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Offering a price too close to $15,000 might discourage Bob from even considering the deal. This offer shows some flexibility while still aiming high. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has the security of knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 if Bob refuses."
