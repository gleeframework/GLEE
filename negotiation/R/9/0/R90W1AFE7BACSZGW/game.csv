"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $650,000. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's worth to you and the market value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $750,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $680,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",680000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer it to you for $720,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair deal you're offering, but I'm on a tight budget. I could meet you at $700,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than reasonable given your initial asking price and where we are now.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700,000. Considering our previous discussions and the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $715,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,7,
