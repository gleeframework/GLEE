As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $650,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700,000. Considering our previous discussions and the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $715,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently moved towards a middle ground and is now offering a price of $715,000. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice will hold firm or that further negotiation will be too slow.  

Here's why accepting at $715,000 is a good move:

* **Significant Savings:** We're still saving $485,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Time Constraint:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  
* **Downward Trend:** Alice's offers have been consistently decreasing, showing her willingness to make a deal.

It's unlikely we'll get a significantly better offer from Alice at this point. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of missing out entirely."
