"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth $12,000 to both of us. I propose that we keep the price at $12,000 to ensure a fair transaction for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $12,000 for the product and John is offering it for that price, there is no incentive to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John ensures you get the product at your maximum price."
