Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1125000, but I was thinking we could discuss a slightly higher price. How about $1175000? I think it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.

Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a good price, while still saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
