"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. My initial offer is $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be open to discussing.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My revised offer is $1250000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1250000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference. How about $1125000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1125000, but I was thinking we could discuss a slightly higher price. How about $1175000? I think it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
