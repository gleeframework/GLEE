"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,250,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about we settle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's try $1,225,000. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting very close to what I can do.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute limit.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
