"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount above your desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and closer to my desired price point. I believe it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and I'm confident that Alice will be willing to compromise given her need to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price point, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Alice. John's offer remains a safety net, but I want to exhaust all options with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $900,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  This is also a good test to see how much Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, but it's still above my limit.  We're running out of rounds, and the negotiation is getting more tense. It's time to secure the deal with John.  His offer is the best option for me at this point, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not comfortable with."
