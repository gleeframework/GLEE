"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is still fair given the product's value, and it allows us both to make a profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,200,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
