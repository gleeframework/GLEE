Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming for the higher end of the ZOPA is ideal. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value,"" setting a confident tone.
* **High Anchor:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point within the ZOPA, leaving room for potential negotiation while still aiming high.
* **Justification:**  You briefly mention ""significant benefits"" to subtly remind Bob of the product's value to him.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate based on his response."
