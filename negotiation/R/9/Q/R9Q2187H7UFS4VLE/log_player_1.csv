Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $85}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $75. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, I know he's willing to pay a premium for it. However, I'm not willing to sell it to him for less than $80, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. I'll send him a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price.
