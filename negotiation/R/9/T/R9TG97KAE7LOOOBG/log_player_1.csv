Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale and still net a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer. It's a substantial amount less than my minimum but leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays with John and allows me to reinvest the earnings sooner."
