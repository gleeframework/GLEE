Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **Higher than your minimum:** $9,500 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $10,000 to him. 
* **Minimizes risk:** This price is high enough that you're likely to get a better price than you would from John, but it's also low enough that Bob might be willing to accept it to get the product."
