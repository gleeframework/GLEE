"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget. This offer allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
