Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm starting to run out of time and the risk of not getting a better price is increasing.  It's better to secure the $10,000 from John than to keep negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
