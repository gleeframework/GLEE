Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay close to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
