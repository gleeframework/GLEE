"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price point. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? It's a significant investment for me, and that figure aligns better with my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
