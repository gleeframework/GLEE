Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before anyone else. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John if Bob declines. 

By offering the product slightly above Bob's valuation, we test his willingness to pay a premium. If he accepts, we earn more profit. If he rejects the offer, we still sell it to John at our minimum acceptable price."
