"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A $110 offer is a reasonable counter-offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. It's likely Alice will find this offer more appealing than her initial one."
