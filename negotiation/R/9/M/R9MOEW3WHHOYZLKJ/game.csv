"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the potential for negotiation and my current budget.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,080,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
