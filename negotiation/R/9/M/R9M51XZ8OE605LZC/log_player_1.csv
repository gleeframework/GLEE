"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your expertise.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's valuation leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and Bob's expertise creates a narrative for the high price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** Expressing willingness to discuss the price shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the bargaining process.

The goal is to gauge Bob's initial reaction and willingness to negotiate within this higher price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly higher than John's guaranteed offer.  Rejecting at this stage keeps the negotiation alive and allows you to try and secure a better price. You have room to counter without dropping below your acceptable threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and recognizing the value of this product. I've considered your offer, and while I'm keen to see this product in your hands, I'm aiming for a price closer to $2,100,000. I believe this reflects the unique advantages it offers and the potential it holds. Are you open to exploring this range?"",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You've lowered your price by $150,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate, but not too drastically.
* **Anchoring:**  By proposing $2,100,000, you're aiming to keep the price point above $2 million, influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking if Bob is ""open to exploring this range"" encourages him to consider options within your desired price range, rather than just countering with another specific number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,950,000 is a significant profit margin above your minimum ($1,500,000) and John's guaranteed offer.
* **""Meeting Halfway"" Psychology:** Bob's framing suggests he's made a substantial concession and is invested in closing the deal. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or you losing him as a buyer altogether. Securing a deal now has value."
