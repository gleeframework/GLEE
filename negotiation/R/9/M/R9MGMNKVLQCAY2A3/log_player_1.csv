Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but I need to stay within that budget to make this work.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $887,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, which is just a small step away from your final offer.  Let's try to find common ground here.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

While I could push for a bit more, Bob is consistently moving towards my price, and $880,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
