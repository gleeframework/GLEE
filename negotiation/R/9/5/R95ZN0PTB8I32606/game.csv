"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $175 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $100? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit low for me, considering the product's value. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $110? It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",110.0,Alice,5,
