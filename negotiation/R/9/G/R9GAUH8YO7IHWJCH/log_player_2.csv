"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save $500 by negotiating with Alice. Even though Alice is confident about her price, it's worth trying to negotiate to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $7,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,250. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer again and ending up with a higher price.  Accepting the offer at $7,250 saves Bob $750 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable compromise considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
