Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $8500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  While $8,500 is a decent offer, I believe I can get closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750.  This reflects the quality and value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal here."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay $8600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my target price of $9,000, Bob's offer of $8,600 is pretty close.  Considering that I could sell to John for $8,000, it's a good time to close the deal."
