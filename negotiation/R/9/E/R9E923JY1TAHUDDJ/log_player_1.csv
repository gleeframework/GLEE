"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating that I'm open to negotiation, I signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the process. 
* **Value Justification:**  I'm providing a basic justification for the price, which may make Bob more receptive to the offer.

**Strategy:** I want to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product before going lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a price of $14000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum.**  While it's lower than my initial ask, I'm not desperate to sell and can afford to try and get closer to my desired price. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing.** Bob's willingness to negotiate is a good sign. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the dialogue and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net.**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage, as I don't have to accept any offer that falls significantly short of my expectations. 

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial asking price. This will show flexibility while still trying to get a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about $14,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise from my perspective."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price but not by a significant amount.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and framing the offer as a good deal for him.
* **Moderate Counter:**  My counteroffer is a moderate move from my previous price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without appearing overly aggressive. 

**Strategy:** I'm trying to meet Bob halfway and see if he's willing to bridge the gap. If he accepts, I'll get a good price. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $14200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $10,000, which makes it a viable option. However, I'm not desperate to sell and believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Building Momentum:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not giving in easily and that I'm determined to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me confidence to keep pushing for a better price. I can always sell to him if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer. I'll aim for a compromise that feels fair to both of us while keeping my goal of maximizing my earnings in mind."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $14,300?  I'm confident that this price is still a great deal for you, and it's a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows a clear willingness to compromise and potentially encourages Bob to accept. 
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I'm reaffirming that Bob's offer is getting closer to my expectations, which can help maintain a positive negotiation tone. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While this is a significant compromise, I'm still above my minimum and have the option to sell to John if needed. 

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to reach a final agreement. If Bob accepts, I get a good price. If he rejects, I'll need to be more flexible in the next few rounds while keeping John's offer in mind."
