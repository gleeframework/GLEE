"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8800.0,Alice,3,
