"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get it for less by negotiating with Alice.  There's also the option of buying from John for $8,000, so rejecting Alice's offer leaves open the possibility of an even better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum:**  $8,800 is only $800 more than Bob's absolute maximum price from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will walk away or offer a price higher than $8,800.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 7 rounds left, accepting the offer minimizes the risk of not securing the product at all.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most sensible choice for Bob, balancing potential savings with the risk of further negotiation."
