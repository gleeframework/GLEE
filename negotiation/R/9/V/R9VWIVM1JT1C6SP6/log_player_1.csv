"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but my original price is based on the true value of this product.  I can be a little flexible, but $800,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. I appreciate you meeting me a little but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $1,000,000? That's my absolute maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob has reached his absolute maximum and is unwilling to budge further. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
