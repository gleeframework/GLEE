"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. Considering its true value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

"I'm not sure how much more we can negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $860000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",860000.0,Bob,6,
