"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a remarkable product that I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its intrinsic value and the benefits it offers, I am extending an exclusive offer to you. For a limited time, you have the chance to purchase this exceptional item at a special price of $1,350,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its market value of $1,200,000, which I believe will be highly advantageous for you. I look forward to discussing the details and hearing your thoughts on this offer. Kind regards, Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is misleading. While she claims it's a ""significant saving"" compared to a market value of $1,200,000, you already know you can buy it from John at that price.  Buying from John saves you $150,000 and ensures you get a fair deal."
