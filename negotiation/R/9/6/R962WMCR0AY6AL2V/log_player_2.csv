"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly exceptional. Considering its value to you and its worth to me, I propose a price of $10,000 for this product. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He wants to pay no more than $8,000, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $9,200 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offers and allows us to move forward with the transaction. Please let me know if this is acceptable, or if you would like to make another counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice is coming down in price,  it's still above Bob's target of $8,000.  He can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,200 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,800?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to suggest a price of $9,000 for the product. This price aims to balance our interests and could be seen as a reasonable compromise. I hope this aligns with your expectations. Please let me know if this offer is acceptable, or if you wish to make another counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target price of $8,000.  It's likely that the negotiations will continue to be difficult and time-consuming, and there's no guarantee that Alice will come down to a price that Bob is willing to accept.  It's better for Bob to buy from John now and save both time and money."
