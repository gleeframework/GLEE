"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:

$20,000 is far above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $12,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$17,000 is still too high for me. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000,  which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 14000}
