"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $12,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000,  which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
