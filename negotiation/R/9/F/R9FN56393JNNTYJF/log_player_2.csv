(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $120 is way over his budget of $80. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should still reject the offer. $105 is still too expensive for him. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $105 is still too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my limit is $90. If you're willing to come down to that, we can make a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $98. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $80.  Even though Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he is running out of time and negotiation rounds. He's better off getting the product for a guaranteed price from John rather than risking that Alice will not come down any further."
