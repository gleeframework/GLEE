"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still above his budget, and there's a chance he can get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8500 is still a little too low for me. How about $10000? I think this price is fair for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's comfortable with.  He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $9625? This price is fair and allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,625 is getting closer to his budget, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's also worth noting that he's already reached the midway point of the negotiation and hasn't yet reached his limit with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $9,625 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9,400.  It's a fair price for both of us and a good compromise.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. This is a fair price for both of us and we can finally close the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice is still offering a price above his budget. While he could continue negotiating, he risks running out of time and having to accept a price he's not comfortable with. Buying from John guarantees him the product at his maximum price point."
