,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8500 is still a little too low for me. How about $10000? I think this price is fair for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10000 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $9625? This price is fair and allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",9625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $9625 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9400.  It's a fair price for both of us and a good compromise.  Let's close this deal.",9400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. This is a fair price for both of us and we can finally close the deal. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,7,
