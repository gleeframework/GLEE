"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher.  There are still 6 rounds left, and I don't want to settle too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm counteroffering again with $135. This is another compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate further, but still holding out for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to sell for $135, I've been through several rounds of negotiation and we're getting close to the end. There's a good chance that Bob won't budge further, and I'd rather sell for $128 than risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with only $100 by selling to John."
