"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my best offer and reflects the product's worth.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to accept $1,175,000 - it's a firm offer and a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
