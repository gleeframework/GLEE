Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $120, starting with a higher price leaves room for negotiation or a straight-out acceptance if Bob is particularly keen on the product. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't need to go below your minimum price. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Depending on Bob's response, you (as Alice) might be willing to negotiate down towards $120 if needed."
