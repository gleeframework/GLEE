,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $9,500 is cutting it too close. I can go down to $10,500, but that's my absolute bottom line.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being upfront.  I can tell we're getting close. How about we split the difference and do $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
