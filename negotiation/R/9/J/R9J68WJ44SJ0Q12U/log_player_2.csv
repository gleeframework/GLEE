"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150, and John is willing to sell the product for that price, it's the most logical choice to buy from John. There's no need to negotiate with Alice if you can get the product at your price limit immediately."
