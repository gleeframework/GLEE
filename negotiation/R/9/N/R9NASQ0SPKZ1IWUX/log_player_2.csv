* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $120 is still above your target price. 
* A counteroffer of $100 is a reasonable starting point that gives you a significant discount while still potentially leaving room for negotiation. 
* This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while also showing you're serious about buying the product."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $130 is still lower than John's price of $150. 
* While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially increasing her price again is present. 
* Accepting the offer at $130 ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of a further negotiation."
