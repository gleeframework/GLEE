Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I'm not willing to sell to John yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $11,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,000? That's still a fair price for a product that's worth so much to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
