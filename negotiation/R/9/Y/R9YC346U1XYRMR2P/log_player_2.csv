It's not worth it to buy the product for $20,000 when you can get it for $15,000 from John.  We'll try to negotiate with Alice first."

I'm starting with a low offer to see if there's any wiggle room. If Alice is flexible, we can likely come to a deal that's better for both of us."

While $18,000 is closer to my limit, I'm still not willing to pay that much.  We'll counteroffer again."

I'm raising my offer, but still staying below John's price.  Let's see if Alice is willing to meet us halfway."

I'm still going to reject.  I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice down to $15,000."

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay John's price, but I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer."
