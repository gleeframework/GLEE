"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This still reflects the significant value of the product to you, and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,400,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a significant distance from my bottom line. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  This offers a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
