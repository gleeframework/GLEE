Round 2

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a significant distance from my bottom line. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  This offers a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
