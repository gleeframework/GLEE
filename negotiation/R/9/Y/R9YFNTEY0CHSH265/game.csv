"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there with $8,500. Let's split the difference and try $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd still get great value from the product.",8750.0,Alice,5,
