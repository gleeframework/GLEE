"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential concessions later on. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'd like to reach a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than my floor price. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,500. This is my maximum budget for this purchase. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming to close the gap further and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there with $8,500. Let's split the difference and try $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd still get great value from the product."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to meet my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, his final offer of $8,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made several concessions and it seems unlikely he'll budge further. To ensure I get a price closer to my minimum, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
