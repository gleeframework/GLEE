"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to maximize my profit.  I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my target of $1,000,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and keeps me within my desired profit margin."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. I think this is a fair price that could be acceptable to both of us."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer.  It's important to remember that I have John as a backup, and I can always accept his offer of $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a midpoint between Bob's latest offer and my minimum acceptable price, and it keeps me within a reasonable distance from John's offer.  With only a few rounds left, I need to be strategic to avoid losing out on a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've been unable to negotiate a higher price. With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John for $800,000 will guarantee I at least get my minimum price."
