"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal.  It's possible Alice is willing to go lower, and Bob can save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a substantial discount.  A $1,000,000 offer is a bold move, but it demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a very favorable price. This strategy sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob wants to pay, but it is closer to his desired price.  Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to continue negotiating.  He can likely secure a price closer to $1,000,000 through further negotiations. Buying from John at this point would be a worse deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, but he's still pushing for a better deal. This counteroffer demonstrates his flexibility while also showing Alice that he is serious about getting a good price.  The $1,100,000 offer is a compromise that is within his desired price range, but still potentially attractive to Alice, potentially leading to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's desired price.  Continuing to negotiate could result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a much higher price is too high.  $1,125,000 is a good deal and saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
