"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable product. I believe its worth is well beyond $1000000, and I'm confident it would be a significant asset for you. I'm starting with a price of $1500000, reflecting its potential. Please consider this offer carefully.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $1500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, given my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is certainly not insignificant, it falls short of the product's true value.  I'm willing to compromise and offer a slightly reduced price of $1200000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. Given my budget constraints, I'm only able to offer $1100000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $1100000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still need a bit more to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
