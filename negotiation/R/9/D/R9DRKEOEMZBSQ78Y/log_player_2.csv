# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable product.

Please consider this offer carefully.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is certainly not insignificant, it falls short of the product's true value.  I'm willing to compromise and offer a slightly reduced price of $1200000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, though it's getting closer.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can push the price lower.  I'll try another counteroffer."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $1100000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still need a bit more to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum.  I'm only $50,000 away from my limit, and I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
