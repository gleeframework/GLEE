I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. If he rejects, I can lower the price a bit, but I won't go below my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is too low for me. I'm not willing to accept that. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $170.  This is a compromise, but still above my minimum.  Hopefully Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."

Bob's offer is my minimum.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $150."
