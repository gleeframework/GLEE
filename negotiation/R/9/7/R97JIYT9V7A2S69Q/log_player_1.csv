Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $700,000 offer. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,500,000. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
