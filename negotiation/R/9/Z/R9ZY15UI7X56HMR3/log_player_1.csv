"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation but still allows me to get a good price. I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay something closer to my desired price, as the product is worth more to him than the price I'm offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $135. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my target.  I believe this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, as it's still a good deal for him, and it brings me closer to my goal of maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I've already rejected his offer twice and there's a risk that further negotiation will lead to a lower price.  Accepting $130 guarantees me a profit and avoids the chance of having to sell to John for a lower price."
