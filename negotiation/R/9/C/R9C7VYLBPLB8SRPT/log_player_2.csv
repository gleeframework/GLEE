Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $80 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $105? It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $95.  You've reached your limit and have a reliable alternative with John at $80."
