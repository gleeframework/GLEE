"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable meeting you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $135. It's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $128? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $128. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering the product for $131.50. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value and your interest in it.",131.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $129? I'm really close to walking away, but I still think this product could be a great fit for me.",129.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $130.50, which is as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",130.5,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $129.50? I'm really close to walking away, but I still think this product could be a great fit for me.",129.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Bob, but I've already gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to go any lower than $130.50. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other offers. I'm still open to negotiating, but I need to prioritize my own interests.",130.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Unfortunately, I've reached my budget limit and can't go any higher. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll think about it and get back to you. For now, I'm rejecting your offer.",0.0,Bob,10,
