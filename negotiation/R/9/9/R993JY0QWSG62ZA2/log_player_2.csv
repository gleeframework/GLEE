"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the substantial benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiating often involves starting lower than your actual target price. This gives room to maneuver upwards while staying within my budget.
* **Significant Difference:** By offering $600,000, I'm signaling that Alice's starting price is significantly off. This might encourage her to make a more substantial counter-offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer helps me gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's unwilling to budge much from $1,300,000, I know I might be better off going with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $600,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant potential, and I'm confident it can generate much more value for you. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, $950,000 is still above my $800,000 limit and what I'm willing to pay.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to move closer to my target. 
* **John's Offer:**  Having John's offer as a backup gives me leverage. I'm not desperate, so I can afford to continue negotiating for a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I've been looking at my budget closely, and to be realistic,  $700,000 is the highest I can go. If we can make a deal at that price, I'm ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious about negotiating but also to signal a firm limit.
* **Staying Below Budget:** $700,000 keeps me well below my $800,000 maximum, leaving some room for a potential final compromise. 
* **Direct and Firm:** By stating this is my ""highest"" offer, I'm adding weight to my proposal and hoping Alice understands I'm serious about this price point."
