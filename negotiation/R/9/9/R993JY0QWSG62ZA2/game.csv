"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $600,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant potential, and I'm confident it can generate much more value for you. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
