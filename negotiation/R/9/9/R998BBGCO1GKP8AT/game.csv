"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $12000 for this item. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to this amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $18000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds.",18000.0,Alice,3,
