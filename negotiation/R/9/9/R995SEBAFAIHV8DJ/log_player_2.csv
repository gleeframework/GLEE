"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $15,000 and Alice is offering it for $12,000, saving you $3,000. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer means paying more.**  While you could buy from John, it's not in your best interest to pay more when a better price is available."
