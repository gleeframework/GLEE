"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $2,000,000 is too high for Bob's budget, and he can get the product for his maximum price from John. It makes sense to counteroffer Alice to see if he can get a better price before going to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,000,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the value and potential this product holds.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,800,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  He can get the product for his desired price from John, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
