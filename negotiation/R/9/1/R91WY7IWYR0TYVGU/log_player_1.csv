Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a price that works for him. While we want to close the deal quickly, there's still room to negotiate before accepting an offer significantly below the product's value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we try a price of $1,000,000 even?  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is the highest I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  At this point, accepting his offer would mean a loss of $250,000 compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
