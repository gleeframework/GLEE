I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,750? It's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent profit and we've come to a deal.  I don't want to risk him walking away and having to sell to John at a lower price."
