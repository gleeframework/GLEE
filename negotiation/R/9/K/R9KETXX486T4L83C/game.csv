"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider a price of $13,500. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",13500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I don't think I can go any lower than that. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",13000.0,Alice,5,,
