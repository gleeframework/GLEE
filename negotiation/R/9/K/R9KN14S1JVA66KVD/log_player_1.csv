"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for negotiation room.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to engage in a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can get more.  I will reject his offer and counter in the next round, hoping to find a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,800,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a profit margin. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above my minimum price and a good compromise. While I would ideally get closer to my initial asking price, it's a better offer than John's. It's also a significant gain considering we are only in Round 4.  It's time to secure the deal and avoid risking further negotiations."
