"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $85 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $100. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for you. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
