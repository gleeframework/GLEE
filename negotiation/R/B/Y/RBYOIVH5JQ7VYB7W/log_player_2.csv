"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is far too high. It's much higher than your maximum budget and significantly inflated from her own valuation. By rejecting this offer, you can start negotiating toward a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product but could you do it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's a common negotiation tactic to start low. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, you're trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired range. 
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves plenty of room for negotiation upwards towards your $80 maximum, while still potentially securing a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. $60 is quite low, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice lowered her price, but it's still significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer.  There's no reason to accept this when:

* You have negotiating room: You're still far from your $80 limit.
* John's offer is a safety net: You can always buy from John if the negotiation goes nowhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness:** By increasing your offer to $75, you demonstrate to Alice that you are serious about buying the product and willing to negotiate.
* **Target Price:**  This offer is just below your maximum budget and a reasonable price point to aim for, given Alice's valuation.
* **Compromise:**  The phrase ""meet in the middle"" suggests a spirit of compromise, encouraging Alice to make a similar move toward your price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $75 is too low, I can go down to $110 as my final offer.  This product is worth it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has declared her $110 offer as ""final,"" signaling she's unlikely to move much lower. 
* **Over Budget:** $110 is still significantly over your $80 maximum budget. 
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $80, ensuring you don't overpay.

It's clear that Alice is prioritizing getting a higher price that's beneficial for her. While she might budge a little, it's unlikely she'll reach a point where it makes sense for you to buy from her over John."
