Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a competitive offer considering its true worth and potential. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I start with a price very close to my guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). This maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Slight Discount:** Offering a small discount ($50,000) makes the offer more appealing than waiting for John while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Confident Language:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to accept the offer. 

**Goal:** The goal is to persuade Bob to accept a price significantly higher than his perceived value ($800,000) while leaving room for negotiation if needed."
