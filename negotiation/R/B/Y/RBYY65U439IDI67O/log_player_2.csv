"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the lowest price possible.  Starting with a significant counteroffer at $10,000 signals Bob's willingness to negotiate and tests Alice's flexibility.  It's a reasonable starting point, considering Bob's maximum budget of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While $11,000 is still above Bob's initial counteroffer, it's a significant saving compared to both the original asking price and buying from John. It's a good compromise, and accepting the offer secures the product while staying within Bob's budget."
