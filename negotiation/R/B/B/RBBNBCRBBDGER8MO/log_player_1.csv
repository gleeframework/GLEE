Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum price and still gives you a good value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price of $12,000, but still offers me a good profit. It also leaves room for negotiation, as Bob might be willing to pay more. 

I'll be ready to accept a counteroffer from Bob, but if he doesn't come close to my price, I'll sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not quite where I want to be. I'm going to see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm asking for $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit and gives you a great deal on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying the product if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,200 is still a decent profit for me, and it seems like Bob is serious about buying the product at this price.  It's important to remember that selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, but it's better to get a deal with Bob now and avoid the potential risk of him changing his mind later."
