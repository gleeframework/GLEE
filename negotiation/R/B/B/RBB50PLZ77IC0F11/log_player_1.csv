Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as that's the highest I can go at this point.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,000,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This price represents a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make this purchase within my budget. Let's work together to reach an agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $950,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $900,000 for this product.  This price is fair and allows both of us to come to an agreeable solution.  I'm confident that we can close this deal if we work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
