"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as that's the highest I can go at this point.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This price represents a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make this purchase within my budget. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $950,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $900,000 for this product.  This price is fair and allows both of us to come to an agreeable solution.  I'm confident that we can close this deal if we work together.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a tough negotiation, but $900,000 is still not enough for me. I'm making a final offer of $975,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to move on to other buyers.  Time is running out.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $975,000 is still not within my budget. To close this deal, I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options, as time is running out for me as well. Let's come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,8,
