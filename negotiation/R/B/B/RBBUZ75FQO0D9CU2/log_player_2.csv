# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
