"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to me is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750?  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value to both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,750 is close, but I need to be closer to $9,000. Would you consider $8,850? This is my final offer.",8850.0,Alice,5,
