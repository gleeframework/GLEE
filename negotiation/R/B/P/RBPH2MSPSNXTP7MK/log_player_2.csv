Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good starting point for closing this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875.

Round 6
