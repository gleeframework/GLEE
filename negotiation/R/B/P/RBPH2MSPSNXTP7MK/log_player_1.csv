Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm also keeping John's offer of $10,000 in mind."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $9,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While we're getting closer, I'm still confident that I can secure a higher price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I could sell the product to John for $10,000 at any time.  I'm going to try to get Bob to come up a bit more before I consider his offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good starting point for closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and it seems like we're getting stuck. While I'm still hoping to get a better price, it's getting close to the end of our negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  John is offering a guaranteed $10,000, so I'm going to take his offer and sell the product to him."
