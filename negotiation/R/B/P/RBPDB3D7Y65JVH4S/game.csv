"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1350000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1380000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,5,
