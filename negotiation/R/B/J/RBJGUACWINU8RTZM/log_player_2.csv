"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no benefit to accepting her offer over buying from John. You should reject Alice's offer and buy from John, as you'll be paying the same price but have the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with John in the future."
