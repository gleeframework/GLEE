"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's something I value at $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, as the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's $12,000 limit. There's a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice or see if she counters with a lower offer."
