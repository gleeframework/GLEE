Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Knowing My Minimum:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have a clear floor for my negotiations.

**Reasoning:**

* I want to maximize my profit.
* Starting high allows me to potentially get a better price.
* It's risky, but the potential reward is worth it. 
* I'll assess Bob's counteroffers and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $1,000,000 is my minimum, it's not a satisfactory profit. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I know the product is worth more to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Rejecting Bob's offer means continuing the negotiation, which carries the risk of him walking away entirely. However, the potential for a higher price outweighs that risk.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm confident I can get a better price than Bob's initial offer.
*  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a decent profit, but it's not my ideal outcome.
*  I'm willing to take calculated risks to try and achieve a higher sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Strategic Price Point:** This price is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating a genuine desire to reach a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Balanced Approach:**  It's important to find a balance between maximizing profit and not pushing Bob away entirely.

**Reasoning:**

* I believe Bob is genuinely interested in buying the product, given his counteroffer.
*  By offering a compromise, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still ensuring a significant profit for myself.
*  This counteroffer is likely to prompt Bob to reconsider his position and potentially meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** While $1,100,000 isn't ideal, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away entirely. 
* **Time and Effort Factor:** Continued negotiations might take more time and effort, potentially leading to a less desirable outcome.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm prioritizing a guaranteed sale over the possibility of a slightly higher price.
*  Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'm aiming for a slightly better profit. 
*  Bob's offer represents a reasonable compromise that allows me to secure a good deal without excessive risk."
