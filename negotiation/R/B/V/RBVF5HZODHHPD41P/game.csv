,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm looking to stay within a budget of $120.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your interest! While I appreciate your offer, $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $175?  Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $175 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $150?  I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
