"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm looking to stay within a budget of $120.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a higher price than Bob's offer. $120 is significantly lower than my minimum, so I'm going to counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your interest! While I appreciate your offer, $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $175?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $175 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $150?  I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
