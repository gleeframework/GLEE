Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, slightly above what the product is worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone in my message to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning that the product is ""fantastic"" to remind Bob of its potential worth to him. 

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I aim to maximize my potential profit while still being open to a deal that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $110 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $85 for it?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. He's expressed interest in the product and acknowledged its value. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to try and get a better price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  This will demonstrate flexibility while also aiming to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $95 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by dropping the price to $95, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This also demonstrates that I value Bob as a potential buyer.
* **Still above minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Encouraging response:** I'm asking ""What do you think?"" to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for quick sale:** Accepting his offer allows me to finalize the sale quickly and avoid further negotiation.
* **Potential for future relationship:**  Even though the profit margin is smaller than I initially hoped for, accepting Bob's offer could potentially lead to future business opportunities with him.

While selling to John for $100 would be a higher profit, accepting Bob's offer offers a balance between potential profit and a potentially beneficial business relationship."
