You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less than $13,000 since it's only worth $8,000 to Alice.  A counteroffer will likely get you a better price."

You should reject Alice's offer. You're still above your target price of $10,000, and since you know the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, you can likely negotiate a lower price."
