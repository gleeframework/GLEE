"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and it's a good starting point for us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for you, given the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $920,000 is still a little below what I need. How about we split the difference and go with $935,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm afraid $935,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $920,000. Can you accept that or do we need to end the negotiation?",920000.0,Bob,6,
