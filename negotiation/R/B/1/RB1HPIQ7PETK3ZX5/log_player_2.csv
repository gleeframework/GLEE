"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or buy from John as a last resort."
