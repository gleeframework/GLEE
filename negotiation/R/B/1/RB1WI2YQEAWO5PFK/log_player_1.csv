Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't rationally pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Zone:**  There's a potential negotiation zone between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob some perceived value. Offering a price slightly below his maximum might make him feel like he's getting a good deal and increase the chances of acceptance.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth in the market."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing exclusivity and value. 
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above your minimum but still leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting his offer or walking away to sell to John."
