"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1,350,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $1,250,000 at this time. This price is still fair considering the value you're offering, and allows for a decent profit margin for you. Please let me know if you're open to this offer.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure we both achieve a satisfactory outcome, I propose a final price of $1,300,000 for the product. This price still reflects the value and quality of our product while providing a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this revised offer aligns better with your financial considerations. I look forward to your feedback.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
