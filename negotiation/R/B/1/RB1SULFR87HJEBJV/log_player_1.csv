Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1,350,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $1,250,000 at this time. This price is still fair considering the value you're offering, and allows for a decent profit margin for you. Please let me know if you're open to this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
