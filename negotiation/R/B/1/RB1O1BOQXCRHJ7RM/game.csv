"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the price, I'm hoping to secure the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $550,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $575,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort we've put into it so far.",575000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  I'm willing to go up to $560,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to get a good deal.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",560000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $560,000. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount and sell the product to you for $585,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",585000.0,Alice,5,
