Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $120.  Offering it at $115 is just below his valuation, making it more likely he'll accept or counter-offer close to your desired price. 
* **Above John's Offer:** The $100 offer from John is your safety net. It makes no sense to offer the product to Bob below this price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both your minimum price ($100) and his own valuation of the product ($120). This suggests he's trying to negotiate a bargain.  It's worthwhile to counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims for a classic negotiation tactic â€“ finding a compromise.  
* **Still Profitable:** $105 is comfortably above your minimum selling price ($100) and a good profit margin.
* **Testing Bob's Seriousness:**  This counteroffer will help gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and how flexible he's willing to be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can we go any lower than that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $100 matches what John is willing to pay.  
* **Minimal Gains from Further Negotiation:** While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars from Bob, it's unlikely to be a significant difference at this point. 
* **Time Value and Certainty:** Accepting Bob's offer now provides a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price.  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away or you having to settle for even less."
