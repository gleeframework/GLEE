"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but the price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a lower price of $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $9,000 is a little bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to settle at $6,500? I think that's a fair price.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in discussion, Bob. I can see you're making a serious effort to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a living on this sale. How about we meet at $8,000?",8000.0,Alice,5,
