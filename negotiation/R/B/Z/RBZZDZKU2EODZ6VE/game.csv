"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  While I'm not at liberty to disclose all the details at this stage, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm confident it could be even more valuable to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $2000000.  This is a limited-time opportunity, so please let me know if you're interested.  If you decline, I have another interested party ready to purchase it at the minimum value.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
