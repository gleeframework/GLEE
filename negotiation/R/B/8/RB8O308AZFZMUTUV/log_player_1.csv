"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal. I'm also mindful of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  It's better to try to negotiate a better price than to settle for a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer to show flexibility, but still aiming for a profit. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $12,000, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm making another small concession, lowering the price to $12,500. This is still a good profit for me and closer to Bob's perceived value. I believe this could be a good compromise and lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good outcome, and it saves me the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing out on a deal altogether.  I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
