"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. I can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,500? "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $14,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value. Could you meet me halfway at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is close to my target price. It's worth accepting rather than risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
