Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,000 and $16,500, which would be $15,750. Can you consider this offer?

Bob's offer:

You have three options:

While it's not the $18,000 I initially aimed for,  $15,937.50 is a significant profit above my minimum. Continuing to negotiate might only yield marginally better results, and there's always a risk Bob will walk away. It's a good deal, and time to close it."
