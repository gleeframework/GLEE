"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and hopefully get as close to my desired value as possible.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** This invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially reveal some of his thinking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While I prefer to get a better price from Bob, John's offer of $800,000 is a solid backup.  

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to meet him somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still reflects the unique value of the product, but it's a significant compromise from my initial price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's unique value to justify my price.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a significant compromise to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $750,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **John's offer is a safer bet:**  While I'm willing to negotiate further, John's offer is a secure option that guarantees me my minimum.
* **Risk of going too low:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean potentially losing out on a higher price in future rounds, especially if John's offer is removed after a certain number of rounds. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my minimum. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. This product is truly special, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you than that in the long run. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This offer is closer to Bob's offer than my previous one, but still above my minimum.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm emphasizing the product's unique value and long-term benefits to encourage Bob to see its worth.
* **Compromise language:** I'm using language like ""significant compromise"" to show my willingness to negotiate.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking Bob for his opinion to keep the conversation open and encourage him to consider my offer.

This offer allows for further negotiation, while also positioning me closer to my desired price point. It's important to remember that John's offer is a strong backup option, which I will leverage if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $800,000, it's still below that threshold. 
* **John's offer is a safer choice:** With John's offer of $800,000 available, I can't afford to settle for less unless Bob comes significantly closer to my minimum.
* **Risk of losing out:**  I'm worried that if I accept Bob's offer, I might be missing out on a better price in the next few rounds. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, but I'm prepared to sell to John if I don't see a significant improvement in Bob's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your commitment to the product.  However, $775,000 is still a bit short of what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $790,000, which is a significant concession given its value.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 790000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** My offer of $790,000 is very close to Bob's offer of $775,000, demonstrating a strong desire to reach an agreement.
* **Finality:** I'm presenting this as my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's perspective to maintain a positive tone. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  John's offer of $800,000 is still available, allowing me to walk away if necessary. However, I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $780000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. Please let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Enough:** While Bob's offer of $780,000 is closer to my minimum than ever before, it's still $20,000 below my minimum.
* **John's Offer is Safe:**  John's offer of $800,000 guarantees me my minimum, and I have a limited number of rounds left. 
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I could end up with an even lower offer.

Given the limited rounds and the availability of John's offer, selling to John is the most sensible choice. It ensures I get at least my minimum price, and I don't risk losing out on that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
