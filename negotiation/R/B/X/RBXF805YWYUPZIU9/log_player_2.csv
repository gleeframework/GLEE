"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than to others. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,400,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $1,350,000 is a better offer than John's, it's still higher than Bob's last offer. There is still potential to negotiate further. Rejecting allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
