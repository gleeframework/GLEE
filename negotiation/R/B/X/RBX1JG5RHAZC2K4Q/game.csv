"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell the product for $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll sell you the product for $9,750. This is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about buying, this is your last chance to make a deal.",9750.0,Alice,7,
