"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it's worth $175, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a slightly higher price than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. This should also encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, which will give me more information to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum, but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly what the product is worth to him, but still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my minimum price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm still a bit higher than $120.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This counteroffer shows I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to go much lower. Splitting the difference is a common negotiation tactic that can be persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm still aiming for $120. It's a firm offer, and I'm ready to close the deal right now if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It seems like Bob is unwilling to budge on his $120 offer, which is below my minimum.  I've already made several counteroffers and I'm getting closer to my bottom line, but not there yet.  To maximize my profit and avoid further negotiations, I'll choose to sell to John for $150."
