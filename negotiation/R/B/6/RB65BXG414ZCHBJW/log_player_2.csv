* **You have 9 more rounds.** There's time to negotiate and try to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is your last resort.** Only do this if you can't get a better deal from Alice."

Round 2

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious interest in buying the product. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's likely Alice will want more than $1,250,000, but it's a good starting point for further bargaining.

* **You have 7 more rounds.** This gives you ample time to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a better deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is unacceptable.**  It's exactly the same as John's price, meaning you gain no advantage by continuing to negotiate with her.
* **Time is running out.**  You have only 3 rounds left, and Alice is unwilling to budge on her price. 
* **No risk in buying from John.**  At this point, buying from John is a risk-free decision as you're guaranteed to pay the same price as Alice's final offer.

Since your primary goal is to save money, and Alice has shown no willingness to lower her price further, it's best to move on and secure the product from John to avoid wasting more time and potentially missing out on a better deal with another seller in the future."
