"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a high price to maximize potential profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm assuming he might be willing to pay a premium for the product.
* **Positive framing:**  My message emphasizes the product's value and potential for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $1,000,000 is my ideal price, it's not unreasonable to expect some negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or willingness to negotiate.
* If the negotiation stalls or I feel Bob is not a serious buyer, I'll move on to John to secure the guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product.  I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on selling to John for $800,000.

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I'll try to understand his reasoning behind the lower offer and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm going to counter with $850,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and leaves some room for us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer but am still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on finding a ""common ground"" to reach an agreement.

**Next steps:**

* I'll monitor Bob's response closely. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers strategically, aiming to maximize profit while staying above my minimum.
* I'll also be prepared to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  There's a large gap between our desired prices.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant profit:** Bob's offer is dropping, and his budget constraints are a red flag. I'm not optimistic that further negotiation will lead to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is above my minimum and a safer option than risking further negotiation with Bob.

**Next steps:**

*  I'm confident in selling to John to ensure a comfortable profit. This avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who seems unlikely to meet my desired price point."
