Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique nature and your specific interest, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Offering it at $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potential to exceed your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's room to negotiate down if needed, potentially settling closer to $1,250,000 or even higher.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some indication that the product might be worth significantly more to Bob than $1,000,000. If you're primarily aiming for a quick sale, a price closer to $1,100,000-$1,200,000 might be more suitable."
