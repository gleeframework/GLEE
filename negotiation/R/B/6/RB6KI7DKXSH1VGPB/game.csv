"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $13,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to you, and it gives me a little room to negotiate. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $11,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for you since you value the product at $12,000. Let's meet halfway!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $12,500. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the value you mentioned it has to you. Can we meet at this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
