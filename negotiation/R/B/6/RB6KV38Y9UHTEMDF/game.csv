"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me and allows you a good profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  which still allows you a significant profit. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise. This would allow both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This price reflects the value of the product while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
