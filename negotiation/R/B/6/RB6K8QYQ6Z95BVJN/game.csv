"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would you consider adjusting the price to something closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for a compromise at $950,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
