Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than the product's minimum value to me ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message highlights the product's worth to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is positive and encourages further discussion, implying that I am willing to negotiate. 
* **John as a Backup:** The existence of John as a potential buyer with a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer provides a safety net and allows me to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers are not satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting his offer would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he is interested and willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price.
* **John's Offer as a Fallback:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value, so I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Re-emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Positive and Open Tone:** The message remains positive and open to further negotiation."
