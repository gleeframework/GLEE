"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth $12,000. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price Bob is willing to pay, it's best to start the negotiation process. There's no immediate need to buy from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me.  However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value I'm placing on the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the integrity of our product's value. Therefore, I cannot accept $10,000. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about if we compromise at $11,000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a better deal.  Buying from John at this point would mean paying the full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $10,500.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution, Bob. Let's aim for a price that respects the value of the product while being more accessible for you. How about $10,750 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is within Bob's budget and is a good compromise. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and potentially raising the price again, or even the negotiation breaking down entirely, is present. It's better to secure the product at a price that's only slightly above Bob's initial target, especially since the alternative is buying from John at a higher price."
