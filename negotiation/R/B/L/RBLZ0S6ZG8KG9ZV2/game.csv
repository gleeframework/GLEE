"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me.  However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value I'm placing on the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the integrity of our product's value. Therefore, I cannot accept $10,000. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about if we compromise at $11,000 for the product?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $10,500.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
