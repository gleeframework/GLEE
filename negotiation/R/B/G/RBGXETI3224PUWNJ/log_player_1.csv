Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

This offer sets a price that is higher than your minimum desired price of $80, but still leaves room for potential negotiation and a win-win scenario for both of us.  It also acknowledges that the product is worth $120 to Bob, giving him an incentive to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is higher than my minimum price of $80, and it's a good compromise considering his initial rejection. Accepting his offer will maximize my profit compared to selling to John."
