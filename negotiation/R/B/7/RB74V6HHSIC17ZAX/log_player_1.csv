Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price, leaving room to negotiate down. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high number, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value, potentially making him more receptive to a lower price later.
* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a guaranteed backup buyer gives you a strong position. You can afford to be patient and walk away from the negotiation with Bob if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer is substantially lower than both your minimum acceptable price and your opening offer. Accepting now would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a large price gap to negotiate. By rejecting, you signal that you're serious about a higher price and open the door for further discussion.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  You have the security of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price. This allows you to confidently negotiate for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $2,000,000. This reflects the product's worth and potential benefits."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  You're lowering your initial price, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The decrease is significant, which may encourage Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer in return. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** The new price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, reaffirming the product's value and your desire for a price closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Offers:** Bob's offer now exactly matches what John is offering. 
* **No Upside:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer or reaching an impasse. There's no potential for a higher price than what John guarantees. 
* **Certainty and Efficiency:** Selling to John immediately provides a sure outcome at your desired minimum price, avoiding further negotiation time and uncertainty."
