Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, I aim to maximize my profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a strong incentive for Bob.
    * It's significantly more attractive than his perceived value of $800,000.
    * It creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if he doesn't take the deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to potentially secure an even better price."
