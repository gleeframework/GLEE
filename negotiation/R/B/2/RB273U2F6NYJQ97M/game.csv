"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $170 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $145. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $100.  Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm hoping to keep the price at $100. If you're willing to consider that, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
