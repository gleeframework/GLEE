"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, $795000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $810000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",810000.0,Alice,5,
