"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, aiming to quickly establish a range for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (budget constraints), which could make it seem more sincere. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $8,000 is still a considerable amount, leaving space for both of us to negotiate and find a price we're comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $12,500.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $10,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get Alice closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up:** I'm increasing my offer from $8,000 to $9,500, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This offer is still below Alice's latest offer, but it's closer to her desired price point.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  My message emphasizes finding a middle ground, creating a cooperative tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I see you're serious about this product. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? That's a very fair offer considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get a price closer to my target.  At this point, it's a risky move, as I only have 5 rounds left before I need to decide on John's offer, but I'm hoping I can close the deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really interested in this product, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, and it's my maximum budget. I'm not willing to go any higher.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm trying to appeal to Alice's sense of reason by highlighting that $10,000 is a fair price, considering the product's value.
* **Serious Tone:** The message conveys seriousness and commitment, hoping to push Alice to accept my offer. 

**Risk:**  It's risky to offer my absolute maximum this early in the negotiation, as I only have 4 rounds left. However, I'm betting that Alice wants to close the deal and will accept my offer."
