Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and focusing on the value the product brings to Bob, hoping to encourage him to negotiate further. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is a strategic move. It's designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob accepts, I get a good deal. 
* **Start the negotiation:** If Bob rejects, it gives me an opportunity to understand his thinking and make counteroffers.
* **Maintain leverage:** It leaves room for me to lower the price a bit if needed, without going below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary. This gives me a strong position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm not willing to sell at a price that undervalues the product, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm determined to get closer to my desired price. This sets the stage for further negotiation. I'm prepared to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm confident in my ability to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This would allow you to get the product at a price that's within your budget and still give me a fair return. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a price of $1,075,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and emphasizing the value of the product while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum price. This approach aims to encourage Bob to accept while showing I'm committed to finding a solution.

**Strategy:**

By making this counteroffer, I'm hoping to:

* **Find a compromise:** This price is closer to Bob's offer, increasing the chances of him accepting.
* **Maintain my leverage:** I'm still above my minimum price, allowing me to stand firm if Bob rejects.
* **Set the stage for a quick agreement:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate, making a quick agreement more likely.

I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary, but I'm confident that this offer will be attractive to Bob."
