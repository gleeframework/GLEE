"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000) and leaves considerable room for negotiation. There are 10 rounds to explore a better price, and rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to set the tone and potentially secure a more favorable deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a fair starting point considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product holds, especially considering its long-term benefits, makes $950,000 difficult to accept.  Could you consider $1,175,000?  It's a significant move on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually agreeable point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,175,000 is still quite high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,062,500. This reflects a significant compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a deal. While $1,062,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to be compensated fairly for the value this brings. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,120,000? This demonstrates further compromise on my part. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
