Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a fair starting point considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
