"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a fair starting point considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product holds, especially considering its long-term benefits, makes $950,000 difficult to accept.  Could you consider $1,175,000?  It's a significant move on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually agreeable point.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,175,000 is still quite high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,062,500. This reflects a significant compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a deal. While $1,062,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to be compensated fairly for the value this brings. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,120,000? This demonstrates further compromise on my part.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see your commitment to finding a fair price.  I'm offering $1,090,000. This is a reasonable compromise that should work for both of us. What do you say?",1090000.0,Bob,6,
