"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know if that works for you.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is significantly below its value. I could be flexible, but I need a price that makes this worthwhile for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
