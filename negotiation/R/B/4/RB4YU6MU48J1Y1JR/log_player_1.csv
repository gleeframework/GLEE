Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I know you'll love. It's yours for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $95, you're aiming for the highest price Bob is likely to accept while still ensuring a significant profit margin. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $80 provides a safety net. You won't be forced to go below your minimum acceptable price."
