"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I know you'll love. It's yours for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds your maximum budget of $100. You can get the product for less by rejecting Alice's offer and buying it from John."
