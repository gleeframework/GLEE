Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you, but I'm open to discussing the price if needed."", ""product_price"": 13500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** By stating you're ""open to discussing,"" you signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the process.
* **Don't Anchor Too Low:** While we know Bob values it at $8,000, aiming slightly above his valuation leaves a better chance of reaching a price closer to your own minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between being assertive about the product's worth and remaining open to finding a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  You have some leverage here:

* **Bob Showed His Hand:** His offer suggests he's willing to pay a premium over his perceived value. 
* **John is a Backup:** You have a guaranteed $10,000 waiting if needed.

Rejecting now keeps the negotiation alive and lets you push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is quite a bit higher for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Compromise:**  Moving down from $13,500 to $11,500 demonstrates flexibility and a desire to find a deal.
* **Hold Ground, But Strategically:** The counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's initial offer, but also a considerable concession from your starting price. 
* **Aim Above the Midpoint:** Splitting the difference between $9,000 and $13,500 would be $11,250. Aiming slightly higher at $11,500 leaves room for further negotiation while keeping the pressure on Bob. 

This approach balances meeting Bob halfway while still pushing for a price that's closer to your target and well above your guaranteed backup offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches Your Backup:** Bob's offer now equals what John is offering you. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation risks pushing Bob away completely.  He's stated $10,000 is his limit.
* **A Good Deal:** While not exceeding your $10,000 minimum, you're getting a fair price for the product. 

It's often better to secure a good deal than risk losing it by being overly aggressive in the final stages of negotiation."
