"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  How about we settle on $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a bit of a discount, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant concession from my initial offer of $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
