Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is higher than my minimum value of $150, leaving room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's valuation, so starting high allows for potential compromise while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still a decent profit for me, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility. I hope this will encourage Bob to move closer to a more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $87.5 is better than Bob's first offer, it's still far too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm getting closer to selling to John for $150, as that seems like a safer option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm making another counteroffer, this time at $125.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but it's still above my minimum value. If Bob isn't willing to come up significantly, I'll likely just sell to John at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still far too low, and I'm starting to run out of patience. At this point, selling to John for $150 seems like the best option. It's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum price.  I'm not going to risk getting stuck with a much lower price from Bob."
