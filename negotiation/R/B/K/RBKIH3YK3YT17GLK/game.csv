"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is too low for me. Could you consider $13,000?  It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
