Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move, showing Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and aiming for a much lower price.  I'm aiming for a price that's still within my budget, but leaves room for further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still above my initial counteroffer and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $300,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, aiming for a price in the middle between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that's more favorable to me. It's important to keep in mind that we have limited rounds, and I want to make sure I can secure a deal within my budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my desired price point, but we're getting closer. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if we can find a price that works for both of us. We only have a few rounds left, so I want to make sure I can secure a deal within my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount. This demonstrates that I'm serious about closing a deal, but I'm also trying to stay within my budget. With only a few rounds left, I need to balance the desire to get a good price with the risk of losing the deal altogether. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Alice to accept, but I'm prepared to move on to John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $487,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $487,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting very close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice's offer is still above my desired price point.  While I could make another counteroffer, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining time.  Buying from John at $800,000 is a secure option that guarantees I get the product, even if it's at a higher price.  It's a strategic decision to ensure I don't miss out on the product completely."
