{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this unique product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal considering its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $15,000, which is higher than my minimum price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and make him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I end the message with a question, making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price possible while keeping the negotiation open and avoiding a quick rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm very interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell and want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. 

Rejecting the offer allows me to:

* **Show I'm not desperate:**  A quick acceptance could make Bob think I'm desperate for a sale.
* **Maintain negotiating power:** By counter-offering, I demonstrate I'm willing to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.

Since I know John will buy for $10,000, I have the safety net of a guaranteed sale. This gives me the leverage to try and get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,000 to seal the deal. It's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing appreciation for his interest. This helps keep the negotiation positive.
* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm offering a compromise ($12,000) but not going all the way down to his offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify the slightly higher price.
* **Open to discussion:** I end with a question to encourage further conversation and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12000 is still a little outside my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal today, but I can only do $11000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 less than my last counteroffer. Considering:

* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed $10,000 sale with John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Further negotiation could drag on, potentially resulting in a lower offer or a failed sale.
* **Closing the deal:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale with a good profit.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option, as it balances earning a decent profit with minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potential delays."
