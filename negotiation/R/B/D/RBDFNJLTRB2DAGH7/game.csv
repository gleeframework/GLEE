"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you than to me.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is my absolute minimum.  This price still leaves a good profit margin for you, and I'm confident it's a fair deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm still very interested in reaching a deal.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 still falls below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. I hope we can close this deal in the next few rounds.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's wrap this up.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
