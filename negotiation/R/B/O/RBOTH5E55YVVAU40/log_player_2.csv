Round 2

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $75.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to my price range, but I still think there's room for negotiation. I'll counter her offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $68?"",
""product_price"": 68
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $68 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go down to $71. This is my final offer. If you're serious about buying, let's close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $71. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $71
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my limit, and she's calling this her final offer. It's a decent price, and continuing to negotiate might make me lose the deal entirely."
