# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product, but $18,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price, as it's well below what you're asking, and still allows you a healthy profit. Let's work together to make this happen.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
