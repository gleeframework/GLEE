"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 

I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in a negotiation. If he rejects, I can lower my price slightly in the next round.  If he accepts, I've made a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target.  I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, and I want to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising the price to $950,000. This is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit margin.  

I believe this offer is reasonable for Bob, considering he's already shown interest by making a counteroffer.  I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough for him to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $920,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still determined to try and get closer to $950,000.  Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $940,000 as a compromise. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still leaves room for further negotiations. I want to show Bob that I am willing to meet him halfway, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit margin. I believe that this offer is fair and reasonable, considering the progress made in the negotiation so far."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiations are getting tense. While Bob's offer of $915,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  At this point, I'm not confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on the secure $1,200,000 offer from John. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
