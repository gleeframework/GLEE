"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the fair value of the asset.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $825,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and it's important to ensure we're both comfortable with the final price.  Let's keep talking.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. Let's settle on $800,000, which is my absolute minimum.
