Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $12,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I believe the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $12,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'll offer $12,500 again, and hope we can meet in the middle. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is persistent with his $12,500 offer. It's getting close to my minimum, but I've already made a significant concession and he's not budging.  John is a guaranteed sale at $12,000.  It's not ideal, but it's the best outcome at this point."
