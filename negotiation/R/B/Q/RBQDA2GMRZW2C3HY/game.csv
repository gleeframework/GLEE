"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth.  Let's find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $12,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $12,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'll offer $12,500 again, and hope we can meet in the middle. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,6,
