"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me.  However, $13,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is a fair offer, I need to get closer to $12,500 to make this work for me. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit. $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This would be a good compromise, and we could both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
