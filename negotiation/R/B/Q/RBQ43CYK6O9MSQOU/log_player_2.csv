"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me.  However, $13,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is a fair offer, I need to get closer to $12,500 to make this work for me. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $12,500 is a better price than what John is offering, there's still a gap between Bob's ideal price ($11,000) and Alice's offer. By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit. $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This would be a good compromise, and we could both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
