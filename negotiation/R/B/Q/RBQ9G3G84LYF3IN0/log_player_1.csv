Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I believe a price of $10,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Opening:** A confident opening offer can encourage Bob to take the deal seriously.
* **Alternative Secured:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
