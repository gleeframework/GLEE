"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a bit too low considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,900,000? I believe this reflects a fairer price for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we settle somewhere around $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better deal.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While I'm always willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line.  To be frank, I have another offer on the table for $1,500,000.  However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This is my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  However,  $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. To meet you halfway, my absolute best offer is $1,350,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting very close to my backup offer from John, and I'm running out of rounds to negotiate.  It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and I'd rather secure a deal now than risk losing him and having to settle for the $1,500,000."
