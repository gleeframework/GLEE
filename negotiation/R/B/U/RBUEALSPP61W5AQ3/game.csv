"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a bit too low considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,900,000? I believe this reflects a fairer price for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we settle somewhere around $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While I'm always willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line.  To be frank, I have another offer on the table for $1,500,000.  However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  However,  $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. To meet you halfway, my absolute best offer is $1,350,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
