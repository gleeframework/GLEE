"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is quite significant, and $900,000 is below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down slightly further. How about we settle on $1,000,000 even? This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
