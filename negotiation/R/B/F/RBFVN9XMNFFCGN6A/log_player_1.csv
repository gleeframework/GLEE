Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $18,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:** While I don't want to oversell, mentioning market value helps justify the price and might appeal to Bob's perception of a good deal. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. This allows me to be more assertive in my negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I'm prepared to adjust the price based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
