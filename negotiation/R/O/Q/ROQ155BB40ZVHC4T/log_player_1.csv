Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  This gives me some room for negotiation, but also shows him that I'm serious about getting a good price. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground between our values. 

This strategy is a good starting point.  I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's reaction and keep John's $800,000 offer in mind as a minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly higher than John's, it's still below my desired price point and my minimum value for the product.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'll use the next round to counter with a price that's still attractive to Bob, but closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the value of the product.  I believe this price is still attractive to Bob, given his initial offer of $950,000, and is close enough to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob will continue to lower his offers, potentially reaching a point where selling to John becomes the more attractive option.  Therefore, I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
