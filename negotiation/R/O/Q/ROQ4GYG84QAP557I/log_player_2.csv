"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Bob is making a significant counteroffer, pushing the price closer to his budget. This shows he's serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget, but it allows for some potential negotiation back and forth.
* **Positive but firm tone:** The message is friendly but clear about Bob's stance.  

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to accept $9,000 for the product. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500. This price reflects the quality and value of the product while remaining competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** Even though Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, $10,500 is still more than Bob's $10,000 limit. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob knows John is willing to sell for $10,000, so there's still potential to get a better price from Alice.
* **Testing the waters:**  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to counter again and see if Alice is willing to go even lower."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you accept."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  This message clearly states that $10,000 is Bob's absolute limit. It puts the pressure on Alice to decide.
* **Compromise:** Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay, indicating a genuine desire to make the deal.
* **Closing:** The message emphasizes Bob's readiness to finalize the purchase if Alice accepts. 

Let's see if Alice is willing to budge!"
