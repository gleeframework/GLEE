"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $2,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm more comfortable with a price around $800,000.  Would you be open to something closer to that range?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To find a middle ground, I propose a revised price of $1,900,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part and keeps us on track to close a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still a significant leap for me.  To be frank, I'm working with a budget closer to $1,000,000. If you're able to come down closer to that range, I think we could close this deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I'm motivated to find an agreement, but to be transparent, $1,000,000 falls short of what I can accept.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. However,  $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can offer you $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but we're not quite there yet.  I'm willing to consider a deal at $1,400,000. However, this is non-negotiable. It reflects the true value of this product and my absolute bottom line. Let me know if this works for you so we can wrap things up.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now. I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm afraid $1,400,000 is still pushing my limits.  My final offer is $1,200,000. It's a strong offer, and I think it's the best I can do.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
