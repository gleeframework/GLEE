"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting at a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob. This allows room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately undervalue my product.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the price is high, it's not unreasonable considering the product's value to me. This allows Bob to feel like he can negotiate a better deal.

**Remember:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 at any point, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:** While it's closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still below my $1,000,000 floor. 
* **Negotiation room remains:** I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a good profit, but I'm not willing to give up the potential of a higher price from Bob just yet.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price between Bob's offer and my minimum. This will show I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $950,000 is still a bit below what I can accept at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer, demonstrating that I believe the product is worth more.

**Strategy:**

By continuing to counter with a price above my minimum, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  This could lead to him increasing his offer in the next round or potentially leading to a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum of $1,000,000. It's tempting to accept, but I'm not willing to settle just yet.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I still have 6 rounds left. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Accepting now would signal I'm desperate, which could harm my bargaining position in future rounds.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to close the gap while still maintaining leverage. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to give up on getting closer to my initial asking price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to where we need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This shows I'm committed to finding a solution, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Counter:** I'm increasing Bob's offer by a relatively small amount, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not accepting his offer yet,  which reinforces that I'm not desperate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes finding a solution. This keeps the negotiations moving forward.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to keep the negotiation moving forward and close the gap. By making small counteroffers, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to increase his offer further. This tactic could lead to a deal that's closer to my desired price without risking a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility in negotiations. I am willing to pay $1025000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the Minimum:** While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum ($1,000,000), I'm still hesitant to accept it.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can still push for a higher price. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and could potentially offer more.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to bridge the gap while still maintaining leverage. I believe a deal closer to my initial asking price is still possible, and I'm not willing to settle for the minimum just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer to a deal! While I appreciate your latest offer, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This shows my commitment to closing this deal, but I also need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing Bob's offer by a smaller amount, indicating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining leverage.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price point.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes finding a solution.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions while keeping the negotiations moving. If Bob accepts, I'll close the deal and secure a good profit. If he rejects, I still have 3 rounds to reach a deal or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am willing to pay $1030000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, the chances of Bob increasing his offer significantly are slim. 
* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than my minimum, it's not a substantial improvement.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is more than acceptable.

**Risk vs. Reward:**

While continuing to negotiate with Bob holds the potential for a slightly higher price, the risk of a stalemate or a lower final offer is too high. Selling to John ensures a safe and profitable outcome, and it's the most logical decision at this stage."
