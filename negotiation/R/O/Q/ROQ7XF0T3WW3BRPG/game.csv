"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering the product for $1,150,000. It's still a fantastic price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a compromise here. I'm willing to lower my price slightly, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,137,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1137500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping for something a bit higher. How about $1,130,000? It's a small increase from your last offer, but it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal!",1130000.0,Alice,7,
