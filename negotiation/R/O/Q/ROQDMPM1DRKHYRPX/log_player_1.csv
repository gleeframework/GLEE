``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum. This is a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
 
I'm offering $135, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in too easily.  I'm also reiterating my enthusiasm for the deal to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

``` 

I'm sticking with my strategy of meeting Bob halfway. This time, I'm offering $134, which is right in the middle of my last offer and his. I'm also reminding Bob that this is a fair price for both of us, hoping to encourage him to accept."
