"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. Can you consider it?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $150 represents a fair price for the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $90. Can you consider it?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to accept $100, my absolute lowest price. This is a great deal for the value you're getting!",100.0,Alice,5,
