"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. While selling to John guarantees me $12,000, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  Let's see if we can close the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product highly valuable.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While $9,250 is getting close to my minimum, I want to see if I can push it a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $9,375 for the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9375 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $9000? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to give up that much yet. I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,500. If Bob is really serious about buying, I'm confident we can find a middle ground in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept.  Let's try $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 9200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $8800? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's offer of $8,800 is too low, and I'm running out of rounds. I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob in the next few rounds, so selling to John is the best option to maximize my profit."
