Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's potential for him to counteroffer.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easier for Bob to understand the offer.

Remember, the key is to be firm but flexible.  You're aiming for the best possible price, but you also need to be willing to negotiate to ensure a deal.  Keep John's offer of $1,200,000 in mind as your safety net throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but based on my budget, I am unable to meet the price of $1400000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1350000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below what you believe the product is worth.  You're aiming for the best possible price, and rejecting his counteroffer allows you to continue negotiating. By rejecting, you demonstrate that you're willing to walk away if you don't get a satisfactory price. This will encourage Bob to come closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price to reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,380,000. This would be a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1380000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  You're willing to compromise from your initial offer.
* **Still aims high:**  $1,380,000 is closer to your desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Reiterates the value:**  You remind Bob of the product's worth, encouraging him to consider a higher price.

By making a counteroffer, you're keeping the negotiation alive and demonstrating your commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Remember, you can always fall back to John's offer if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1365000. I hope this proposal is acceptable and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,365,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,365,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,365,000 is very close to your desired price range, and it's significantly higher than John's offer.  It's worth accepting at this point because:

* **Close to your target:** This price is only $15,000 below your initial offer, which is a reasonable compromise.
* **Higher than John's offer:** You're guaranteed to earn more than you would by selling to John.
* **Potential for future deals:**  By building a good relationship with Bob, you might be able to secure future deals at even better prices.

While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures you secure a good price for the product and potentially establishes a strong business relationship with a valuable customer."
