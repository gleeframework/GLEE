"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $70 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to try to negotiate with him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you can't go as low as $70, Alice. How about we split the difference and meet at $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $77.50 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $81.25? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 81.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up slightly. How about $79? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, his offer of $79 is very close to what John is offering. To guarantee a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation, I'm going to sell to John for $80.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal."
