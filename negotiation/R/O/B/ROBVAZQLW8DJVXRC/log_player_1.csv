Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not asking for the full $15,000 immediately, allowing for a potential back-and-forth.  
* **Having a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is interested, so there's potential to reach a mutually acceptable price through further negotiation.
* **Leverage with John:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12,500?  This is still a great deal for a product of this quality, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price between his initial offer and my previous offer. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to justify my price.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm suggesting a compromise to encourage Bob to close the deal.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  If necessary, I can adjust the price slightly lower, but not too much below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $11,250 is getting closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still not ideal. 
* **Time is money:**  Negotiating further with Bob might take more time and energy, potentially leading to a lower price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a quick, hassle-free transaction.

I'm prioritizing the certainty of a good deal with John over the potential of a slightly better deal with Bob, which is still uncertain and time-consuming."
