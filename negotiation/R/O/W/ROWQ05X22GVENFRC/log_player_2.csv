Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $720,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is still slightly above my ideal price, she's consistently come down and is now offering the product for $720,000. This is a significant savings compared to her initial offer and is even below my fallback option of buying from John for $800,000. Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away and missing out on a good deal."
