"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I believe this price is more reasonable and would be a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10200. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,

I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up more value. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll reconsider.",10500.0,Alice,7,
