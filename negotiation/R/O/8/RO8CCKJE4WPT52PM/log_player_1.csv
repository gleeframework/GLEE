Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $145. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose money. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while having a guaranteed sale with John."
