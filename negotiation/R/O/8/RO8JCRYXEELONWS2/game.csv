"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $8500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. How about we meet in the middle again at $8750? It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,5,
