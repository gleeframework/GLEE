"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
