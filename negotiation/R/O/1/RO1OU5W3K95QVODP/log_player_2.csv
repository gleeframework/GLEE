Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,250, but I'm willing to get close. How about we try $12,800? It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to my target price.

Alice is very unlikely to go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might annoy her and make her less willing to compromise.  At $12,800, you're still getting a decent discount compared to John's offer."
