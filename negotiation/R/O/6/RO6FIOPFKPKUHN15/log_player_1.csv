Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $120. This is our baseline.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly above Bob's valuation leaves space for potential negotiation. He might counter-offer, and we can still settle at or above our minimum. 
* **The John Factor:** We have a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, we can sell to John for our minimum acceptable price. This allows us to be a bit bolder with Bob.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob outright rejects a price above $120. However, this strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still having a guaranteed sale option."
