"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as it's significantly less than its true market value. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a significant advantage over purchasing elsewhere. Let's seal the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's reach an agreement on this price, and I can guarantee you'll be very happy with your purchase.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $950,000 is still a bit too much for me. My absolute maximum is $925,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've both moved significantly from our initial positions.  Let's close the deal at this price and call it a day.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm running out of time, and I need to be close to my asking price. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to drop to $975,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers. Let's finalize this deal and avoid losing out on a valuable product.",975000.0,Alice,7,
