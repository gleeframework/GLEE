"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we settle at $8,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",8500.0,Bob,4,
