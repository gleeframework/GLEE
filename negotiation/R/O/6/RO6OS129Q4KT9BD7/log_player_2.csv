"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're looking to get the product for under $150, and Alice's initial offer is above your ideal price.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105, which is still above Alice's value of $100 but significantly lower than her initial offer of $120. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $115 is within my acceptable range (under $150) and closer to my desired price than John's offer.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will raise her price again or reject my counteroffer. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice to secure the product within my budget."
