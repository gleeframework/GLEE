{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.  I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  While $10,500 is tempting, I believe I can get more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about $11,000?  That's a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,250 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try to counter with a price closer to my $11,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,250 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so I'd like to propose $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  He's not budging much, and I'm running out of rounds. $10,500 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000."
