"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** $500,000 is a very good price, but it's still early in the negotiation. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, so rejecting and counter-offering allows for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a very low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This price is significantly lower than her initial offer, and if she rejects it, it will give me a clearer picture of her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $400,000 is a good price, I'm still hopeful that Alice will go lower.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer allows me to continue exploring if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to keep the price lower. This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and it allows me to test the waters further without risking a deal breakdown."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is starting to get closer to my ideal price. Accepting this offer secures the product for me at a reasonable price, and with limited rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to keep negotiating. It's unlikely I can get a significantly better price, and I don't want to risk having to buy from John at a much higher price."
