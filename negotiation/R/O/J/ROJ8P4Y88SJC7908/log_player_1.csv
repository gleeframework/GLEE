Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $80, giving him some room to negotiate. However, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $150, leaving me some room to compromise if needed. This strategy allows for a potential negotiation while ensuring I can still sell the product to John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price of $150. While it's tempting to take $75 rather than nothing, it's important to remember that John is willing to pay $150. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price, and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $100? This would still give you a good deal, and it would work for me."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am unable to go above $80 for this product. Could you possibly meet me halfway at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than what I can get from John.  Since I'm aiming for the highest profit possible, selling to John for $150 is the most sensible choice in this situation."
