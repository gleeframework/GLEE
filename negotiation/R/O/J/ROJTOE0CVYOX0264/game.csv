"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I'm very interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $12,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?  I'm serious about purchasing this product, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $12,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
