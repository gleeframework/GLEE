"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him, and he has room to negotiate. He's willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, so he can afford to counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $11,500 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate further. He has 7 rounds left and can afford to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $11250, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, so think carefully before responding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's been able to get the price down significantly from her initial offer, and he's only 5 rounds away from having to buy from John at a much higher price. At this point, it's better to secure the deal at a price that's still within his budget, rather than risk having to pay more."
