# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $130 is still above your maximum budget, so there's room for a counteroffer."

While $125 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'll try another counteroffer."
