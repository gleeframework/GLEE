Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit for you.  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum value of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer again allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum and potentially close the gap.  It's important to remember that John is a guaranteed sale at $12,000, so I have a solid backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, but $7,000 is just a little too low for me.  Let's try $8,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
