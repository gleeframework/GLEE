"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is too high. I have room to negotiate down from her initial price and closer to her valuation of $800,000.  It's much better to try for a lower price with Alice before resorting to paying John's $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to anchor the negotiation closer to Alice's valuation. By starting significantly lower, I signal my willingness to negotiate but also establish a target price that benefits me. This leaves room for further bargaining while keeping the offer attractive enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved closer to her valuation, the price is still significantly higher than her potential selling point.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to show I'm serious about getting closer to the $700,000 range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  To be frank, my budget is closer to $750,000 for this product.  If you're able to work within that range, I think we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:**  By increasing my offer, I demonstrate to Alice that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** Sticking close to the $750,000 mark keeps the pressure on Alice. It reinforces my budget constraints while leaving a small margin for potential compromise. 
* **Honesty (To an Extent):** While I'm not revealing my absolute maximum, being somewhat transparent about my budget can encourage Alice to be more realistic in her counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll sell the product to you for $800,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has reached her minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely she'll go any further. Accepting this offer secures the product for $200,000 less than John's price, which is a significant saving."
