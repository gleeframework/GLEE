Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting high allows you to potentially secure a price significantly higher than your minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price provides a cushion for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can gradually reduce the price, still aiming for a final amount well above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. You're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value, justifying the high initial price without revealing your hand completely. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening move.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
