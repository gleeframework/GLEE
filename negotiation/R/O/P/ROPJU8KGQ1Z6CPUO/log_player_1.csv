"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, exceeding Bob's perceived value by a significant margin. This allows for room to negotiate and hopefully pushes Bob to consider making a counteroffer. I'm also leaving a significant buffer between my offer and my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm also confident that I can achieve a better price through continued negotiation, making selling to John at this point less appealing."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm continuing to reduce my price to show willingness to negotiate, but staying above Bob's last offer.

I'm willing to risk losing a few more rounds to secure a more favorable outcome.  It's worth noting that selling to John at this point would secure a much better price for me, but I'm still hopeful of closing a deal with Bob at a higher price point."

{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

This is my final counteroffer. I'm taking a significant step closer to Bob's last offer but still maintaining a price point above my minimum acceptable price.

```

**Explanation:**
