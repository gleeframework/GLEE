"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $13500. I can meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm willing to go down to $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you consider this price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as low as $12500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $13000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm willing to pay $12750. Can you consider this price?",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, but I'm still willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $13250. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $13250. I'm willing to pay $12750, but I need you to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",12750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse, but I'm still willing to try to find a mutually beneficial price. Since you're firm on $12750, I'll meet you there. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12750. However, I want to make it clear that this is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12750.0,Alice,9,
