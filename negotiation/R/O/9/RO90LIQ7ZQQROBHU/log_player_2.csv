"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $9,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  Since you have 10 rounds and want to save as much as possible, rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to see if you can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, aiming to start the negotiation aggressively while leaving room for potential compromise. This counteroffer signals my interest in buying the product, but also sets a clear expectation that I'm looking for a price below $9,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $8,500 is closer to my desired price range, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a better price.  This counteroffer is a compromise,  testing if Alice is willing to meet me halfway. If she rejects again, I'll need to seriously consider buying from John, as we're nearing the halfway point in negotiations."
