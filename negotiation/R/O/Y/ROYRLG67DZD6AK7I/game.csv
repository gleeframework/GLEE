"Thank you for expressing interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your feedback. While we aim to accommodate all parties involved, I would like to propose an alternative that might better align with both our interests.

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? That would be a fair compromise, don't you think?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
