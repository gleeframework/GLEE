"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its value and your interest, I propose we set the price at $12,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. This price is fair considering my budget and the potential savings you'd gain from selling quickly. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and the opportunity cost of not selling to another interested party, I am willing to accept $10,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
