"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its value and your interest, I propose we set the price at $12,000. This offer takes into account both the worth of the product to me and your perceived value of it, aiming for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

$12,000 is too high for Bob's budget.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and the opportunity cost of not selling to another interested party, I am willing to accept $10,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
