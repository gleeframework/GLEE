"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I think the product is great, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle again at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
