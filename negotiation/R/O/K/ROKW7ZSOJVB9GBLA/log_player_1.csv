Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, allowing for potential counteroffers without immediately resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:**  I can likely get a higher price from Bob. I'm willing to explore counteroffers before resorting to selling to John.
* **No immediate rush:**  There's no indication that John is waiting, so I have the luxury of negotiating further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This reflects the value I've placed on it, but also recognizes your willingness to negotiate. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to me, emphasizing why this price is still reasonable. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm subtly implying that this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously."
