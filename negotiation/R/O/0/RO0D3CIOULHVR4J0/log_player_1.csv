Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
``` 

This offer is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than your minimum threshold of $8,000 and  allows Bob to get the product at a price that's still below its perceived value to him. This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a higher price while also keeping Bob as a potential buyer."
