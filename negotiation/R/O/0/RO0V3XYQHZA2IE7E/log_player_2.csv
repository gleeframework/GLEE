Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $1,075,000. This is still a good deal for you as it's significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and only slightly higher than your last counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but there's a risk Alice will reject your offer and you might end up having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is a good way to secure a decent deal while minimizing risk."
