"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, it's worth $150 to you. I propose to sell it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its worth. Please let me know if this offer suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150. 
* It's also significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150. 
* While Alice is exaggerating the value to you, the price is acceptable within your budget."
