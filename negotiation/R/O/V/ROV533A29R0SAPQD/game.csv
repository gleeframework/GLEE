"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
