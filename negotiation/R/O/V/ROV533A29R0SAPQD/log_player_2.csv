"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer, we aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Not Too Low:** While we want to save money, offering a price that's too low might offend Alice and make her less willing to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the backup option of buying from John for $1,000,000, so we don't want to go too far below that initially."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, we're getting closer to our backup option of buying from John for $1,000,000. There's still a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer aims to find a compromise by suggesting a price halfway between Alice's current offer ($1,100,000) and our previous offer ($800,000).
* **Staying Competitive:** We're still aiming for a price lower than our backup option of $1,000,000 from John.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" we signal to Alice that we're serious about making a deal, while also encouraging her to move closer to our desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go below our alternative option. It's now more advantageous to buy from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation."
