``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my desired $120."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for further negotiation and I'm not ready to settle yet."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. Bob is refusing to budge on his price, and I've already made several concessions. It's becoming clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us, and I'm not willing to risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price. John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is my minimum threshold. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
