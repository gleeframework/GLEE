"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to consider purchasing it, but I need to start at a more reasonable price point. I'm offering $850,000, which is still a strong value for this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that offer is still a bit low for what I have in mind, I'm willing to come down a bit to keep us moving.  How about we meet halfway between our two previous numbers at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,175,000 is still outside my price range. Let's try to find a number we can both agree on. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000.  This represents a fair price considering the value of this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
