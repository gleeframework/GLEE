"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price. You can still save more money than buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

While $9,250 is better than Alice's original offer, it's still higher than your desired price point. You can continue negotiating and try to get closer to your desired price, or purchase from John to ensure a price within your budget."
