"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to move forward with the sale.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",9000.0,Bob,4,
