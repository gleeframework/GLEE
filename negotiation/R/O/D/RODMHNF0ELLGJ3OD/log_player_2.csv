It's better to try and negotiate with Alice further. You have a good chance of getting a lower price, as she values the product higher than you do."

You're still getting a better deal from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice again.  You can try to meet her halfway, or make a counteroffer a little closer to her price."
