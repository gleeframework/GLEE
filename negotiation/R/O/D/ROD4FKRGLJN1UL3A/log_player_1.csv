"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a strong offer above your minimum price ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This first offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to buy and how flexible he might be on price. 
* **John as Backup:** Keep in mind you have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price if the negotiations with Bob aren't progressing well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $18,000 is better than your fallback option (John at $15,000), but you have room to negotiate for a better price.
* **Show Willingness:** By rejecting, you signal that you're serious about getting a good deal, but it also shows you're open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 20000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're coming down from your initial offer, but still maintaining a price significantly above Bob's first offer.
* **Middle Ground:**  Offering a price in the middle often feels like a fair compromise to both parties and can encourage agreement. 
* **Highlight Value:**  Reiterating the product's value subtly reminds Bob of the benefits and justifies the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $17,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving slowly on price.  While $17,500 is tempting, you have time to negotiate and he might be willing to go higher.
* **Maintain Position:** Rejecting shows you're firm on getting closer to your desired price. 
* **Consider Alternatives:** You're getting close to your safety net with John ($15,000).  In the next round, be prepared to either accept a price closer to $17,500 or walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $19,000. This is my best offer and a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 19000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer (Mostly):** This price signals that you're nearing the end of your negotiation flexibility. 
* **Slight Concession:** You're still making a small concession to show you're willing to compromise.
* **Time Pressure:** You're getting close to halfway through the rounds, subtly adding time pressure to the negotiation.
* **Prepare for Decision:** Be ready to decide whether to accept a slightly lower offer from Bob or move on to John if Bob rejects this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to be fair, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $16,500 is still better than your guaranteed option of selling to John for $15,000.
* **Slow Progress:** Bob has been incrementally increasing his offer, but it's clear he's unlikely to go much higher than this.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away, leaving you to settle for John's $15,000 offer. Accepting now secures a profit above your minimum. 

While you could push for a little more, it's strategically wiser to accept Bob's offer now and secure a reasonable profit."
