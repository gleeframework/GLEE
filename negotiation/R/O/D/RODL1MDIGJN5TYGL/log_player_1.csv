"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to negotiate. I'm also leaving room for myself to lower the price if necessary, especially since I have John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to my minimum acceptable point, as I want to make sure the deal happens while still getting my desired value. Since I have John as a backup, I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob continues to lowball me, but I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I will closely monitor the situation and consider selling to John if Bob continues to be unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering a compromise price,  halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also protecting my interests.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
