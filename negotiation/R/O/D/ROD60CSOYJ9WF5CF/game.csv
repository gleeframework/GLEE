"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering $875,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Bob,6,
