Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'm not willing to go any lower.  I know Bob values it less, but this is my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $950,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, showing flexibility. I believe this price is still fair, considering my minimum value and Bob's willingness to pay slightly more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  Further negotiation could lead to a higher price, but it's also a risk, as I might not be able to reach a better agreement. I'm also considering the time and effort involved in continuing negotiations.  $900,000 is a good deal, and I'm happy to finalize it."
