"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000? This would still leave you with a good deal, and I could make a decent profit. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,325,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $1,280,000?",1280000.0,Bob,4,
