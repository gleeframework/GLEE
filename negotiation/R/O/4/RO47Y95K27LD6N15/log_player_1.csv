"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $170, knowing that Bob's maximum value is $120. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get closer to $150. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm offering $155,  which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and potentially leads to a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can reach a deal closer to my desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to sell the product for $150, which is my minimum price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While I'd like to get a higher price, the negotiation is taking too long. I'm happy to sell to John for $150, as it's the same amount I would get if Bob accepted my final offer."
