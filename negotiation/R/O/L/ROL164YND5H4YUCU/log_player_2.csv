"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $10,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down. Even if she doesn't, you're not losing any money by rejecting her initial offer."
