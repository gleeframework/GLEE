"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great value for a product worth $15,000 to you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider it?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider it?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm getting the sense we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $15,250. This is a great deal for you, and it's as low as I can go.  If you're not interested, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",15250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,250. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider it?",14750.0,Bob,8,
