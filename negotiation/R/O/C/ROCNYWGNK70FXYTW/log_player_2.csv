"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows that Bob is serious about getting a good deal, but is also willing to compromise.  By offering $11,000, Bob is also leaving room for a possible middle ground during the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is a reasonable price for Bob.  He's still saving $3,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll have fewer rounds to make a deal.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity."
