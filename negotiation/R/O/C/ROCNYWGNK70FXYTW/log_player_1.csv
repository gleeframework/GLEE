"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is below Bob's perceived value but still leaves me a good profit. 
* **Building a relationship:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the value to Bob to encourage a positive negotiation. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's room to lower the price if Bob counteroffers, but I'm not giving away too much initially.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while also considering the risk of Bob walking away. I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to secure a deal closer to my desired price. However, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. The option of selling to John for $10,000 acts as a safety net, ensuring a minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I want to try to get closer to my initial offer of $13,000, and I have 8 more rounds to do so. 

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm lowering my price slightly from $13,000 to $12,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This price is still within my profit range, but it's closer to Bob's offer, making it more attractive.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the idea that $12,000 is a good deal.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and open to finding a compromise.

**Strategy:**

By adjusting my price and highlighting the value proposition, I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency and nudge Bob towards accepting the deal. This approach allows me to explore potential common ground while keeping my profit margin in mind."
