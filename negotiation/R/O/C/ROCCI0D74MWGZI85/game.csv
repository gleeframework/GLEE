"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer lined up.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
