Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth a lot more than my asking price. How does $120 sound?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit lower, while still ensuring a significant profit above our minimum ($80).
* **Appear Reasonable:**  The message frames the offer as a ""great deal,"" increasing the chance of acceptance. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still being attractive enough to avoid him rejecting the offer and forcing us to sell to John for $80."
