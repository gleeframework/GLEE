"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects its value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This price reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for both parties. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
