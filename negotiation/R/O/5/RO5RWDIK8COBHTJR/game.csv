"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if you're willing to meet me at this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1200000 might be a stretch for you, but I also need to consider the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer you the product for $1000000.
