"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider a price of $875,000, which reflects a more reasonable compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $875,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Could we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This price recognizes the value you're gaining while still being fair to me.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go up a bit more to $780,000.  This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",780000.0,Bob,6,
