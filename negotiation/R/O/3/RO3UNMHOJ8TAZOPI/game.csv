"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $8,500. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about $8,600? This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to reach an agreement.",8600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $9,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $8,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",8800.0,Alice,5,
