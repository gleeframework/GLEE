"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $11,500 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need something closer to $12,500. This would be a fair compromise, and still allow you to get a great deal on a product you value.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable paying $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
