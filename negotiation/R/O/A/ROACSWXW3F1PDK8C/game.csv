"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $10,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer on the product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product and would be happy to pay $10,250. That's a great price for both of us, and it would help us close this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,6,
