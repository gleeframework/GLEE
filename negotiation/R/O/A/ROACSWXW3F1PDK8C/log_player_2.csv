"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's initial offer is $2,000 above Bob's maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.
* **Compromise:**  While $9,000 is still less than what the product is worth to Alice, it's a starting point for negotiation, and it shows Bob is serious about buying. 
* **Strategic Message:** The message emphasizes that Bob is genuinely interested in the product but needs a lower price to proceed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There is still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer and seeing if Alice is willing to compromise further.
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John would be a safe option, but Bob wants to save money. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open and potentially leads to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $10,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** Bob's counteroffer is now closer to Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Fair Offer:**  $10,500 is a fair price, as it's halfway between Alice's last offer and Bob's maximum.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is still positive and encourages continued negotiation.  Bob is showing flexibility while remaining firm on his desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Over Budget:** Alice's offer is still $750 over Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's still room for negotiation.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and Bob might be able to get a lower price with another counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding John:** While John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000,  Bob is determined to save as much as possible and wants to see if he can negotiate a price even lower than that with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product and would be happy to pay $10,250. That's a great price for both of us, and it would help us close this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's counteroffer is a significant step closer to Alice's offer, showing a genuine effort to find a middle ground.
* **Fair Offer:** $10,250 is a fair price, as it's very close to Bob's maximum budget and only $500 away from Alice's last offer.
* **Positive and Determined:** The message is optimistic and reinforces Bob's interest in the product, while remaining firm on his desired price."
