Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,012,500. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to $975,000, as I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.
