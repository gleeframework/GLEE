Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that acknowledges its worth. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,025,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, but I need to be firm. This product has a lot of interest, and while I value our conversation, I can't go below $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain.
