"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above this price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that acknowledges its worth. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,025,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,012,500. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to $975,000, as I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, but I need to be firm. This product has a lot of interest, and while I value our conversation, I can't go below $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
