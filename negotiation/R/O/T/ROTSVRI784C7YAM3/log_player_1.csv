Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay your full asking price. 
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting at your desired price creates room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly highlights the product's value, potentially influencing Bob to consider a higher price than he initially intended. 

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, it's unknown if Bob would be willing to pay slightly more than $8,000.  If you wanted to explore that possibility, you could start with a lower offer and risk losing John's guaranteed purchase."
