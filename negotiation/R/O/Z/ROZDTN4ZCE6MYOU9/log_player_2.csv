"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While $9,000 is under your $10,000 limit, you can save money by rejecting Alice's offer. You know John is willing to sell for $10,000, but there's a chance Alice might lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
