Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll get a lot of value out of it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $12,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a win-win scenario.
* **Message:** I've made the message friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the great deal being offered. This helps increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizes Potential Gain:** A $12,000 sale is better than the $15,000 from John, so there's incentive to make a deal with Bob.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob balks at $12,000, there's room to negotiate down, potentially to a price that still benefits both of us.
* **Prevents Loss:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still fall back on the guaranteed sale to John for $15,000."
