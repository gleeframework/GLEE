Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My floor:** I know I can get $15,000 from John, so anything above that is a win for me.
* **Bob's ceiling:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so anything above that is a loss for him.
* **Negotiation space:**  There is a $7,000 gap between our valuations. This allows room for negotiation.
* **My offer:** I'm offering $12,000, which is halfway between our valuations, giving Bob a good deal while still getting a decent price for myself. 
* **Risk:**  There's a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, the risk is limited."
