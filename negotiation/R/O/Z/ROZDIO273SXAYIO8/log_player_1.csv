Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. I'm asking for $1,200,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification for the price:**  While not revealing your minimum, the message hints at the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's thoughts and opens the door for counter-offers.

By aiming high initially, you increase your chances of maximizing your profit while still having the security of John's offer."
