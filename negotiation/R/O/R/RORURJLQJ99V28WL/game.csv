"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low. It doesn't even cover my minimum price. How about we split the difference and meet at $900,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that $600,000 was too low. How about we meet closer to the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 still isn't enough for me. It's very close to my minimum, but I'd need to go up to $850,000 to make this work. This offer gives you a substantial profit margin, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer, considering the market value and our respective positions.",800000.0,Bob,6,
