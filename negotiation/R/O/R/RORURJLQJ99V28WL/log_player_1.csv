Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low. It doesn't even cover my minimum price. How about we split the difference and meet at $900,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 900000}
