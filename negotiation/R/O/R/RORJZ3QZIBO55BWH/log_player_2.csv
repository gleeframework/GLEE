Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $600,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, considering the value this product brings.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 still isn't close enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant offer, considering my minimum is $1,500,000. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her ""final compromise"" is still $200,000 more than John's offer.  There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and continuing the negotiation risks losing John's deal. Buying from John guarantees the best price within Bob's budget."
