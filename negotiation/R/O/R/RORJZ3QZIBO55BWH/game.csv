"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, considering the value this product brings.  Let's find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value, but $1,200,000 is still too far apart from what I have in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 still isn't close enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant offer, considering my minimum is $1,500,000. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
