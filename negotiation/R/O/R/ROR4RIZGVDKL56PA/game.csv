"Alice, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still a bit wide for me. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value remains much higher than your current offer. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, so I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
