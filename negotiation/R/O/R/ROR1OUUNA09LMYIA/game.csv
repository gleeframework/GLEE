"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm looking to get a fair price for it. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet, Bob. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
