{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too far below the true value of this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value this product will bring to your business.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work towards a deal. While $1,200,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
