"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but reflects the true value of what I'm offering.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too far below the true value of this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value this product will bring to your business.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work towards a deal. While $1,200,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,250,000, but I'm still only able to offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute limit of my budget. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to consider other options.  Let's see if we can find a way to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
