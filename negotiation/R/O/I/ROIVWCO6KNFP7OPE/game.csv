"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm ready to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this price is fair given the product's value and allows for both of us to have a positive outcome.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $875,000, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $875,000 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $862,500?  This price reflects the product's value while ensuring we both walk away with a fair deal.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $870,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",870000.0,Alice,5,
