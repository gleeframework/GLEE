Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to drop to $1,225,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to have a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we make this the final offer: $1,200,000.  This seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and there's no guarantee that we'll reach a deal in the remaining rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
