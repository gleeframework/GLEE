{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm happy to offer it to you for $10,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone by acknowledging the value Bob sees in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not in a rush. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to try and get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $9,250?  It's still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $12,000, and it would allow me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my last counteroffer and represents a good compromise.  It's also significantly higher than what I could get from John, so it's in my best interest to accept."
