"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $9,250?  It's still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $12,000, and it would allow me to get a fair price for the product.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
