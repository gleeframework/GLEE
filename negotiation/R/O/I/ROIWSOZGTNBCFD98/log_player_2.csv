Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in this product but $12,000 is a little higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer again, seeing if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and need to make a profit. I can do $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is a good price considering my initial target of $10,000.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing out by continuing to negotiate."
