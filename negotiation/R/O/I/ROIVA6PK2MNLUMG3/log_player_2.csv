It's a great deal at $500,000, but Bob should try to negotiate further and see if he can get an even lower price. There's no harm in trying!"

Bob is going to try to get a really low price, aiming for $300,000.  This is a very aggressive counteroffer, but it's a starting point for negotiation."

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $400,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. He'll try another counteroffer."
