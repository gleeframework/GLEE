"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it! I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"That price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable starting point. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"We're getting closer, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 to make this deal happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you have your limits, but so do I.  $11,000 is my absolute best offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"This is getting tough, Alice! I'm pushing my budget, but I can go up to $11,500 if you're willing to make this deal happen.",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making a big concession, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to the deal. However, I still need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,9,
