"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love! I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. Can you consider my revised offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? This is a fair price for both of us and ensures we both get a good deal.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to pay $92.50, which is closer to my original target. Can you consider my revised offer?",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $92.50 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $96, which is a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",96.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, but $96 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $91, which is my absolute maximum. Can you consider my revised offer?",91.0,Bob,8,
