"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $650,000. I'm confident that you'll find this price reasonable considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 Alice's starting offer is significantly lower than my budget and the product's value to both of us. There's a high chance I can negotiate a much better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the starting point, that price is a bit too low for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I believe this price is still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer closer to her last offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $700,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit high for me. How about $600,000? That seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is still a bit higher than your target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $675,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're now within a reasonable range. Accepting at $675,000 secures the product at a good price without risking further negotiation or having to go with John."
