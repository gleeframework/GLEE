"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,000?  It's still a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $10,500 still isn't quite enough for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,
