"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90.  If we can agree on that, I'll take it off your hands.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still just a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $92, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, I think this is a fair price we can both agree on.",92.0,Alice,5,
