{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation if he rejects the offer. It also shows a willingness to be flexible and allows for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90.  If we can agree on that, I'll take it off your hands. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still just a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $92, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, I think this is a fair price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 92}
