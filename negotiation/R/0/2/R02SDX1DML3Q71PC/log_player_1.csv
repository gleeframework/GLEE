Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
