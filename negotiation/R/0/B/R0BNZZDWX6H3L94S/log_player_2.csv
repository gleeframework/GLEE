Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12500 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to sell for $13500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?

Alice is not budging much further, and you've already had several rounds of negotiation. You're getting close to your budget but are still $1,500 over your ideal price.  At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and secure the product for $12,000."
