"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:**  This is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **The message:** It's friendly and highlights the value of the product to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.
* Potentially secure a higher price if Bob is eager to buy. 

This approach allows me to either close the deal quickly if Bob accepts, or open the negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  Remember, I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  While I could potentially accept and earn some money, I'm confident I can get a better price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Goal:**  Maximize earnings, ideally close to my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's still room to increase the price.
* **John as Backup:**  The security of John's offer at $15,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal.

**Next Step:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to sell for $13,500.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:**  I'm remaining friendly while emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the fairness of my new offer.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to:
    * Gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway.
    * Potentially secure a price closer to my goal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Moving closer to Bob's offer demonstrates flexibility and encourages further negotiation.
* **Negotiation Gap:**  A $1,000 gap still remains, which gives us room for another round of negotiation if needed.
* **Backup Plan:**  I can still sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
