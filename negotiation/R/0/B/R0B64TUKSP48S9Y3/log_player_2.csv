"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $15,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's too risky to accept her offer, as I'd be overpaying considerably.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a better price with Alice, or alternatively, buy from John for a more reasonable price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $10,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13,500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still above my budget. While it's closer to my maximum than her original offer, it's still not ideal.  I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. If I can't get a better deal, I'll buy from John for $10,000."
