"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1300000 for the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1100000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and it gives us both room to come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1250000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1250000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1150000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that considers both our interests.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1225000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1225000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a favorable outcome. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
