Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer, followed by the offer itself:

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as much as possible above her minimum ($800,000).
* **One Chance:** She only gets one shot with Bob before going to John (her guaranteed sale).
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob is willing to pay $800,000, meaning any price above that is a no-go.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. I believe this reflects its worth while leaving you with a significant gain from its acquisition."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offer is significantly above Alice's minimum but not ridiculously high.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the markup. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it allows space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might:

* **Accept outright.**
* **Counter-offer with a lower price.**
* **Reject the offer.**

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has her backup plan with John at $800,000."
