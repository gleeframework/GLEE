"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $9,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we meet at $10,200? It's a good compromise that still gives me a decent profit.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I think we're getting close.  How about $9,800? That's a fair offer considering it's almost halfway between our last two prices.",9800.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,800. How about we meet at $10,300? It's a small step up from our previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",10300.0,Alice,7,
