"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $9,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we meet at $10,200? It's a good compromise that still gives me a decent profit.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,800. How about we meet at $10,300? It's a small step up from our previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,300.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk that Alice might not budge. John's offer of $12,000 is a guaranteed way to get the product and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing completely."
