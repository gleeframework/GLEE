"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a respectable profit.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $1,100,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,075,000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,075,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's try to come to an agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so how about $1,060,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal. If you're truly interested, let's close this deal now.  ",1080000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,080,000 and my previous offer of $1,060,000. How about $1,070,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1070000.0,Bob,8,
