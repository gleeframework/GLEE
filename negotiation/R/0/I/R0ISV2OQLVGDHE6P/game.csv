"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
