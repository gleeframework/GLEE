"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $825000 for the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $800,000? This is my final offer, as I have another seller willing to sell me the product for that price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're really serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I can meet you at $825000, but I'm not budging below that. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free upgrade and a 5-year warranty. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
