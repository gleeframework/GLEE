"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to negotiate further or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This strategy aims to:

* **Establish a baseline:** By starting low, we signal our budget limitations and leave room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  Her response will indicate how willing she is to move from her initial asking price.

We need to be prepared for Alice to counter with a still-high price or even reject our offer outright. However, this bold move might incentivize her to negotiate more seriously to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but my ownership comes with significant inherent value that justifies a higher price.  To keep this moving, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Alice reduced her price, it's still significantly higher than your budget and John's offer. It seems there's room for negotiation, so rejecting and providing another counteroffer is the best approach."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond my budget. To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to $700,000. If you're able to make a more realistic offer, I'm still interested. Otherwise, I might have to explore those alternatives."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Increase your offer slightly:** We're moving closer to John's price, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but also setting a firm limit.
* **Introduce competition:** Mentioning ""other options"" creates urgency and might motivate Alice to settle closer to your range.

**Important:** We're entering a critical stage. If Alice doesn't significantly reduce her price in the next round or two, opting for John's offer might be the best choice to ensure you stay within budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty. It seems we're still quite far apart in our valuations. I've done a lot of analysis on what this product can do, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns beyond what you're currently considering.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,700,000.  However, this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

This is a strategic decision. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Her ""final offer"" and the significant gap between her price ($1,700,000) and your budget ($800,000) suggest she won't go much lower.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:** John offers the product at a price you're comfortable with.
* **Limited rounds remain:**  With only 5 rounds left, risking further negotiation with Alice might not yield a significantly better deal, and you could lose the opportunity to buy from John. 

While you might be able to negotiate Alice down a little further, it's unlikely she'll meet your budget. Accepting John's offer secures the product at a price you find acceptable, eliminating the risk of ending the negotiation without a deal."
