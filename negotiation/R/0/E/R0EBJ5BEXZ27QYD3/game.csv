"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not comfortable with $850,000. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $780,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",780000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $780,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $820,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $820,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $805,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",805000.0,Bob,4,
