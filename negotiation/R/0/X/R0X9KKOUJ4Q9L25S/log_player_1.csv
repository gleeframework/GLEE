{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's perceived value but higher than your minimum. 
* **Shows confidence:** It demonstrates that you believe the product is worth a significant amount.
* **Sets a positive tone:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a mutually beneficial negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's counteroffer is closer to your desired price ($14,000) than John's offer ($12,000). There's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to $14,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain some bargaining power. You can now counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to move closer to your price.

**Next Step:**  You will counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $13,000 is a tempting price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $14,000.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $13,200 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that I hope will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer is very close to your desired price of $14,000. It's only $800 less, which is a relatively small difference considering the overall value of the product.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or become less willing to negotiate. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that is very close to your goal. 
* **Better than John's offer:** Bob's offer is significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000. 

By accepting Bob's offer, you're securing a good deal and maximizing your earnings."
