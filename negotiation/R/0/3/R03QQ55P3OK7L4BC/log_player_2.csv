# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While $90 is lower than John's price, you know you can potentially get the product for a better price.  You'll try to negotiate with Alice first."
