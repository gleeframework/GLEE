"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe would significantly enhance your endeavors and contribute greatly to your success. This product, valued at $800,000 to you, holds immense worth and potential for growth. I am offering it to you at a special price, reflecting my confidence in its value to you.

To make this offer even more compelling, I propose a deal where you can secure the product for $750,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its intrinsic value, providing you with a substantial advantage over other potential buyers in the market.

Please consider this offer carefully. If you decide to proceed, I assure you a seamless transaction with excellent customer service and support throughout the process. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
Alice

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $750,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $800,000 and a better deal than buying from John at $800,000."
