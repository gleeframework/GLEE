"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity to get this product at a price that's below its true value. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $800000 on this product. Would you consider accepting such an offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to agree to your proposal, my maximum budget remains at $800000. Could we possibly meet closer to this amount, considering my financial constraints? Thank you for understanding.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've thought about it, and I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my current financial situation, I believe $900000 would be the most I could reasonably offer. I hope this aligns with your expectations for a fair transaction.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $900000, which would be $1000000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your effort in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering my budget constraints and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a final offer of $950000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there with $950000. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $1050000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,9,
