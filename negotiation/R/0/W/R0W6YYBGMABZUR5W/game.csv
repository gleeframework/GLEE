"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $8,500 is a good offer, I'm not quite ready to accept it. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This still gives you a significant value, and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
