"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm holding out for a better price. Bob clearly values the product more than $8,500, and I believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $8,500 is a good offer, I'm not quite ready to accept it. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This still gives you a significant value, and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$9,000 is a good price.  It's more than what John is offering, and it's within a reasonable range of my desired price.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but I don't want to push too hard and potentially lose the deal altogether."
