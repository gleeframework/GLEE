"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $8,500 is a good offer, I'm not quite ready to accept it. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This still gives you a significant value, and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. He's already shown that he's willing to pay more than $8,500, and Alice is willing to come down from her original price, so there's still room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
