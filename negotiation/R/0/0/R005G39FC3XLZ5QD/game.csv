"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I think it would be a great asset to you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $7,500. This product is truly worth more. Would you be willing to meet closer to my previous offer at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,500 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $8,250? That's a significant increase on my end, and I'm really trying to make this work.",8250.0,Bob,6,
