"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the market value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This would be a great deal for you and would still allow me to make a reasonable profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price that's more reasonable for me. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is closer to my original target. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",925000.0,Bob,6,
