Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price, even if it's just slightly above John's offer. I'm willing to push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but this product truly is a valuable asset. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle on $1,215,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we meet at $1,200,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob has reached my absolute minimum price, matching what John is offering. It's unlikely I can push him further without risking the deal entirely. It's best to accept now and secure the sale."
