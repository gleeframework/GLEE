{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. How about we meet at $11,375? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's make a deal!

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to let this slip away, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. Let's make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to make a deal with Alice, and it's likely Alice won't budge any further. With only one round left, Bob has two options:

* **Accept Alice's offer:**  This means paying $11,250, which is still above Bob's ideal price range.
* **Buy from John:**  This is the safer option, as it guarantees Bob can get the product for $12,000, a price he's comfortable with.

Since Bob is risk-averse and wants to save as much money as possible, buying from John is the best decision at this point."
