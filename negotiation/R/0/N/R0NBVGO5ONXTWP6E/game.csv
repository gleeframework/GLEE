"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $11,250 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,875. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this, and both walk away happy.",10875.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. How about we meet at $11,375? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's make a deal!",11375.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not going to let this slip away, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. Let's make it happen!",11250.0,Alice,9,
