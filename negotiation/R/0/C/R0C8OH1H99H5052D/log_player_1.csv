Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm willing to sell for at least $10,000, as that's the value to me.
* **Bob's maximum:**  He's willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:** By offering $14,000, I'm starting at a price that's closer to my desired outcome but still leaves room for negotiation. 

**Potential outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** I secure a good deal, earning a profit of $4,000.
* **Bob rejects:** I have room to negotiate down to $13,000 or $12,000 if necessary before considering the fallback option of selling to John for $10,000."
