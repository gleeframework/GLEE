"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for. However, I'm willing to be flexible and meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10250.0,Alice,5,
