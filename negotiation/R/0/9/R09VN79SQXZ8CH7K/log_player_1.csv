Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot! I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a good profit, but I'm also open to negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $75?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $72? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $72 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not confident I can get Bob to budge much further, and I don't want to risk a drawn-out negotiation.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so I'll take the sure thing."
