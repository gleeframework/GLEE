"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is incredibly valuable, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,050,000, reflecting its potential. This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $1,000,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by claiming she has another buyer. Even if it's true, you have a guaranteed option with John for $1,000,000. There's no reason to pay $50,000 extra."
