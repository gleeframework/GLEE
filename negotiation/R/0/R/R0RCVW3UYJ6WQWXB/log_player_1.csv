"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the potential of this product, I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. This price still reflects the value I see in the product while allowing us both a reasonable margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than what I believe the product is truly worth. Considering its potential value and the market demand, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it still offers you a significant return on your investment. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
