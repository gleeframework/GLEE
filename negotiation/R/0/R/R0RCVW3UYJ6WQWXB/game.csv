"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. I'm confident it's worth at least $800000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This price reflects the product's potential and the value it can bring to your business. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the potential of this product, I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. This price still reflects the value I see in the product while allowing us both a reasonable margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than what I believe the product is truly worth. Considering its potential value and the market demand, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it still offers you a significant return on your investment. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
