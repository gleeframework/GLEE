"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's make a deal!",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $102.50. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",102.5,Alice,5,
