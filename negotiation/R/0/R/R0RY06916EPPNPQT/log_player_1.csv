"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see how Bob reacts and gauge his interest level before making any further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,125,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a decent profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating and believe I can still secure a better price. There are still a few rounds left and I don't want to rush into a deal that leaves too much money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1110000}
```

I'm offering $1,110,000.  This is a slight concession from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility. It's also a price that still puts me above John's offer, ensuring I don't lose out on value if Bob declines. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still not a price that I'm fully comfortable with.  I'm confident that I can still get a better deal, and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  There are still a few rounds left, and I don't want to settle for anything less than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1095000} 
```

I'm going to offer $1,095,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping it will convince Bob to accept. I'm trying to be reasonable while still maintaining a decent profit. There are only a few rounds left, so I need to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. The negotiations with Bob have not been fruitful, and we are nearing the end of our allotted rounds. Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is just too low for me to accept.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, selling to John guarantees me a safe and acceptable profit. It's better to secure a deal than to risk losing out on a sale completely."
