"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I need to stay within that budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500. This is a fair price, and it's the closest I can come to your offer while still ensuring I get a reasonable price.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $9,250.  This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, and I appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to go down to $9,400. This is the very last compromise I can make, as it's still a considerable distance from your initial offer. Let's try to seal this deal now.",9400.0,Alice,7,
