``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's a potential for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $10,000."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, and I'm happy to move a little closer to your last offer. Would you be willing to settle at $7,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer of $7,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
