"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,150,000 is just not going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,200,000? That's my absolute bottom line, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $1,180,000? I'm willing to pay that price, but I don't think I can go any higher.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
