"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can still save money by negotiating with Alice.  While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates that you are serious about buying the product but are not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is a good deal, as it is significantly lower than John's offer of $1,200,000 and still within your budget. There is a chance Alice might counter lower, but accepting her offer guarantees you get the product for a good price.  The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential savings."
