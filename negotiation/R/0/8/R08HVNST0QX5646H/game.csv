"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $9500? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $11000, which is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm happy to go up to $10500.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
