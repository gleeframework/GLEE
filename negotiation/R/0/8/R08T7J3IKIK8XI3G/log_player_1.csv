Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $12,000, so I won't accept anything lower.
* **Potential upside:**  By offering $15,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Even if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John.

This strategy balances maximizing my potential profit with ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal."
