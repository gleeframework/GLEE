Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is very consistently moving towards his maximum price. We're still getting good increases from him each round, and we're well above John's offer. The risk of him walking away is relatively low at this stage."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been very persistent, and I respect that. Let's cut to the chase â€“ I'm confident this product is worth every penny of $1,100,000.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to apply a bit of pressure. We're still above John's offer and Bob is consistently increasing his offer. By introducing a ""final offer"" with a small concession, we might push Bob to agree. If he doesn't take this deal, there's a real risk he'll get stuck below $1,100,000, and we're better off with John's guaranteed offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,070,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now countered with a lower offer than his previous round, signaling he may be at his limit. Additionally, he has labeled this as his ""final offer.""  While there's a chance we could squeeze a bit more out of him, the risk of him walking away is now much higher. Accepting his offer would net us $70,000 more than John's, but there's a good chance further negotiation could result in a loss.  

It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed $1,000,000.  This ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away, leaving us with nothing."
