""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,100,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation ($1,100,000) significantly increases your chances of closing the deal for a profit of $300,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might reject it and you'd lose out on the extra profit. This offer aims for a good balance between a high sale price and a high likelihood of acceptance."
