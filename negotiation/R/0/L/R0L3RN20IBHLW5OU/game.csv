"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me, and it allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a reasonable compromise that still benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while still giving you a profit.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $10,750. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
