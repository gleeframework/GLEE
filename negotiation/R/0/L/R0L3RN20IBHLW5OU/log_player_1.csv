Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me, and it allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while still giving you a profit.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250.

This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 10750}"
