"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $10,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I think this is a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
