"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be extremely valuable to your business.  I understand you may not be familiar with its full potential, but I'm confident it's worth significantly more than the price I'm offering.  I'm willing to let it go for $900000. This is a chance to acquire something truly special at a price that's still advantageous. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,1,
