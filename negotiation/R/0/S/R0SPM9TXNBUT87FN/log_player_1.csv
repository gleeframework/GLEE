"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially ($950,000) leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's high value to you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price this high anticipates counteroffers but keeps us comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential to Bob, encouraging a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than his perceived value of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation. You're willing to engage in further rounds to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $850,000 undervalues its potential.  I could consider $925,000 â€“ I believe that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Coming down slightly demonstrates willingness to negotiate. 
* **Hold Firm on Value:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  The counteroffer meets Bob halfway between the initial offer and his counteroffer, signaling a desire to find a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you believe in the value of this product, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a strong deal. It's:

* **Significantly Above Your Minimum:** You're making a $100,000 profit.
* **Close to Your Initial Ask:** Shows your starting point was well-positioned.
* **Likely Close to Bob's Limit:**  He's already moved up, and further haggling risks losing the deal. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob by pushing for a slightly higher price in later rounds."
