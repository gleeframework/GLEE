This offer starts at a price that is higher than my minimum value of $120, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which I think is a fair price.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $130.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really only comfortable paying $100.  I'm happy to buy it at that price, but I'm not going to go any higher.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll just go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is adamant about his $100 offer, and I'm not willing to go that low. It's better for me to sell to John for $120 and avoid further negotiation."
