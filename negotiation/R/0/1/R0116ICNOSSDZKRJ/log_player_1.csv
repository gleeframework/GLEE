Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,150,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,050,000?

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $1,000,000 offer.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
