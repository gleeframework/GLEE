"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still offers you a good profit margin.  Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering my value for the product and your desire to sell. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a decent deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
