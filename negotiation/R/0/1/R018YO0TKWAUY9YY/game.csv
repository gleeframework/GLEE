"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000.  Would that work for you?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,600,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  Could you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but $1,150,000 is just too low for me to consider.  My final offer is $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my genuine desire to do business with you.  Let me know your decision.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and I respect your position.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
