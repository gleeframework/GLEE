"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm trying to be a good customer, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $11,800? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",11800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $12,000.  I'd much rather see this go to you, but I need to be fair to myself.  Would you be willing to meet me at $12,200?",12200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, and I'm glad you're willing to work with me. I'm still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,200. How about $12,100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12100.0,Bob,6,
