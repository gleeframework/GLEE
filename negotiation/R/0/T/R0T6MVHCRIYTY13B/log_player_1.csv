Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and appear more flexible if you decide to lower the price later. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $150, I'm leaving space for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Considering Bob's Alternative:**  While I know Bob values the product at $80, I also know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120.  I don't want to go too low too quickly and risk losing potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still less than what John is offering. I have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $130, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his price.  
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to justify the higher price.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  This offer still keeps me above my guaranteed sale price to John, ensuring a potential profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is higher than my guaranteed sale price to John ($120). While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. It's better to secure a profit now than risk losing out entirely."
