"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,500? It's a good compromise and closer to my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might still be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
