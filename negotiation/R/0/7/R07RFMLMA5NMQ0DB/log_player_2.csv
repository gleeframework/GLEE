Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

While I could try to haggle further,  $115 is a reasonable price and a significant savings compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
