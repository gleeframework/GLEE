"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a fantastic opportunity to get a high-quality item at a price that's hard to pass up. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, you can still get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $100, and you know John will sell it to you for that price.  It's in your best interest to try and negotiate with Alice further or simply buy from John."
