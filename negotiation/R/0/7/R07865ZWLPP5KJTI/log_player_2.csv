"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within his maximum budget. This should encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500 to make this work for both of us. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll agree.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate even lower, potentially getting closer to the $15,000 he's willing to pay.  He has a few more rounds to work with before deciding to go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his ideal price point while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. By offering $15,500, he's only $500 away from his maximum budget and could potentially secure a good deal."
