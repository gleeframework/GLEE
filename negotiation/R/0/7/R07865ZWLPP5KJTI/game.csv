"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500 to make this work for both of us. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll agree. ",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
