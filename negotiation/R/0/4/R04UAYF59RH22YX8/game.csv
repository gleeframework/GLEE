"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and functionality, it's valued at $120 by me. Considering its worth to you might be around $80, I propose we find a fair compromise. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $100? This way, both parties can feel satisfied with the transaction.",100.0,Alice,1,
