``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, and hopefully allows me to secure a price closer to what I believe the product is worth.  I'll be watching for his response and ready to adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a significant profit. I'm hoping he sees this as a fair middle ground and accepts the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum. I'm not thrilled, but it's significantly better than selling to John for $800,000.  I'll take it."
