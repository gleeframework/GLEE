Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be very valuable to you!"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $90, you leave some room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting and you earning a larger profit than selling to John."
