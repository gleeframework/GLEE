"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $1,500,000 is a tempting offer, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the significant value the product will bring to your business.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, but I'm still hesitant to pay $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I respect your position and willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while working for you.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,900,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've already offered $1,700,000 in round 6, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at this price, so I'll stick to my previous offer of $1,700,000. I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,8,
