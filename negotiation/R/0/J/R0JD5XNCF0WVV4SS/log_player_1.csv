Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,450,000. I know this product is highly valuable and believe it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always best to try for a higher price first. 
* **Attractive to Bob:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it slightly below my minimum ($1,500,000) creates a significant profit margin for me while still potentially being appealing to him. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This approach balances securing a good deal with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
