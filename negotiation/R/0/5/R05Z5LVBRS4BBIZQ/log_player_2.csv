"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so there's no reason to pay $200."
