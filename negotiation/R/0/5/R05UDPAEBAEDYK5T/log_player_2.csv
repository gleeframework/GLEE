Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
