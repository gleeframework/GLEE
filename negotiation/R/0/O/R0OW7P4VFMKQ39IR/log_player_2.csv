"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than to me. I'm happy to discuss a price that benefits us both. To start, I propose a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's too high, and there's room for negotiation. He should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product to you is significant, and I believe $1,200,000 undervalues it. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,325,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,262,500 for the product. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1262500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a solution that works for us both.  How about we settle right between our two prices at $1,293,750?  This recognizes the value of the product while still landing us a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,293,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,293,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While it's getting closer to his ideal price, he can likely still get a better deal. He should continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to $1,262,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $1,293,750 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's aim for a price that's truly in the middle - I'm offering $1,278,125. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1278125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your negotiation skills.  However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal as well.  Let's meet in the middle once again at $1,285,937.50.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,285,937.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,285,937.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer.  While it's a bit higher than his last counteroffer, it's still a significant savings compared to the initial price, and getting closer to his desired range.  He's also nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and the risk of going to John and paying $1,500,000 is becoming more real.  It's a good compromise to close the deal now."
