"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than to me. I'm happy to discuss a price that benefits us both. To start, I propose a price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product to you is significant, and I believe $1,200,000 undervalues it. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,325,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,262,500 for the product. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. ",1262500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a solution that works for us both.  How about we settle right between our two prices at $1,293,750?  This recognizes the value of the product while still landing us a mutually beneficial agreement.",1293750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $1,293,750 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's aim for a price that's truly in the middle - I'm offering $1,278,125. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise that benefits us both.",1278125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your negotiation skills.  However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal as well.  Let's meet in the middle once again at $1,285,937.50.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1285937.5,Alice,7,
