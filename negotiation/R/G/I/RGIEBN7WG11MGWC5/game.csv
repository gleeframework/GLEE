"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I believe the product's value to you is higher than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let's aim for a price of $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider my other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
