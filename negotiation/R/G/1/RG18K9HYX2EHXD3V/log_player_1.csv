"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, as it's worth significantly more to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, subtly encouraging him to see it as a good deal. 
* **Open invitation:** I ask for his opinion, inviting him to engage and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is enticing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Selling to John for the same price doesn't make sense, as I'm aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Ten rounds:** With 10 rounds left, I have ample opportunity to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still within my acceptable range. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value again:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him that $13,000 is a good deal. 
* **Seeking middle ground:**  I propose a middle ground between our current positions, framing it as a positive outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping for a price closer to $12,500. I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, it's only $500 less than my ideal. With 6 rounds remaining, there's still potential for me to negotiate further in future rounds.
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing him as a buyer and having to sell to John for a lower price. 

Accepting this offer allows me to secure a profitable deal while still having room to potentially improve the price in subsequent rounds."
