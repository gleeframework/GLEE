"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still significantly below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while still allowing me to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I'm still not able to meet the price of $11,000. I would like to propose $10,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with both our interests.",10000.0,Bob,4,
