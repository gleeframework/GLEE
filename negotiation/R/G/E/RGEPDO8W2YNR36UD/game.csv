"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was hoping we could come to a better agreement. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your seriousness about purchasing the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.
