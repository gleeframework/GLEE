Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is your maximum budget, so you're starting with the price you'd be willing to pay from John.  Hopefully, Alice will be willing to negotiate down to that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

You're offering a price that's halfway between your maximum budget and Alice's last offer. This shows you're serious about buying the product but are still trying to be fair.  Let's see if Alice will meet you in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice is not budging much, and her last offer is still above your budget. It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John for a guaranteed $800,000. You've tried negotiating with Alice, but it's clear that she's not willing to meet your price. It's better to secure the product at your maximum budget than to risk further negotiation that might not be successful."
