"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $12,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me is $15,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me and your need to sell it. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me is $15,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,7,
