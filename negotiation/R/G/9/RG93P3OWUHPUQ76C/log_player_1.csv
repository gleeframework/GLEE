Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive and engaging message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to express his thoughts, making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price.

This approach allows me to test the waters with Bob, see if he's interested, and gauge his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not immediately ready to settle for it. Bob's offer is right at my minimum, and I believe there's room for me to potentially get a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Show I'm not desperate:**  This demonstrates that I'm confident in the product's value and am not willing to accept the first offer.
* **Maintain leverage:** This keeps the negotiation open and gives me the opportunity to potentially secure a higher price in the next round. 
* **Gather more information:** By observing Bob's response to my counteroffer, I can gain a better understanding of his true willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $90? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly suggesting that $90 is a fair price.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm still open to discussing the price further, hoping to find a mutually agreeable solution. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between firmness and flexibility, giving me a good chance of reaching a mutually acceptable deal without resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  At this point, it's more advantageous to accept his offer than to risk further negotiation:

* **Minimizing risk:**  There's no guarantee that a counteroffer will lead to a higher price. Bob might become less interested or walk away completely. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation takes time and effort, potentially delaying the sale and the potential for a higher price might not outweigh the inconvenience.
* **Minimizing losses:** Accepting $85 is a reasonable outcome, especially considering John is willing to pay only $80.

While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting $85 ensures a quick sale and avoids potential losses."
