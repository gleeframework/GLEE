Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a price closer to my minimum of $1,200,000. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still too far below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'll counter his offer in the next round, but I'm getting closer to selling to John if we can't find a more agreeable price."
