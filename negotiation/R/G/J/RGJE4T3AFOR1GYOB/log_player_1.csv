Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $400,000.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to earn above John's price.

**Strategy**

The key is to find a price that's significantly appealing to Bob while still maximizing your profit. Offering a price too close to his valuation might make him suspicious or feel like he's not getting a ""good deal."" 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. I recognize its immense value to your business, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at a price that reflects its worth while also providing you with significant value.  I propose a price of $1,050,000."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message starts by emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""careful consideration"" suggests you've thoughtfully priced the product.
* **Win-Win Framing:**  Highlight that the price benefits both of you.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,050,000 gives Bob a $150,000 discount (enough to be enticing) while giving you a $250,000 profit over your fallback option.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance."
