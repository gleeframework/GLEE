Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Sense of urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially reduce his inclination to negotiate down significantly.
* **Justification of value:** While not explicitly stating the exact value, the message implies the product is worth a significant amount by using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential.""

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can gradually decrease your asking price, but never go below your minimum of $1,200,000."
