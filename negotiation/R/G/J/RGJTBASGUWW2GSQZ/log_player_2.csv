"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, there's no immediate urgency to accept Alice's offer. By rejecting, Bob can attempt to get a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (20%) is a good strategy to signal Bob's seriousness about negotiating while also giving Alice room to counter without feeling pressured. This opens the negotiation and allows for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price.  He still has plenty of rounds left to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's price but still leaving room for a potential deal.  It shows that Bob is willing to meet halfway while also demonstrating that he believes the product's value is closer to his initial offer."
