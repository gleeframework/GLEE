,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $70? That's a fair offer, considering it's valuable to both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $85. It's a great price for a product that's worth so much to you.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close to what I'm willing to spend.  How about $75 and we have a deal?",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product.",82.0,Alice,7,
