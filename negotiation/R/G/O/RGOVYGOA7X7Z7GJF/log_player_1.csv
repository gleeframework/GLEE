Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am currently working within a budget of $1,050,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my current budget, I am able to offer $1,080,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $1,080,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We'll continue to counter-offer in hopes of reaching a price closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now getting closer to the later rounds of negotiation. Setting a firm final offer at $1,100,000 creates a sense of urgency while still leaving room for a profitable deal. Bob has shown willingness to move upward in his offers, so this price point is likely to be enticing enough to close the deal, while still netting a good return."
