I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not eager to settle for that low of a price. I'm going to counter and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering a price of $1,250,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for potential negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a higher price, $1,100,000 is significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000. It's time to close the deal and move on."
