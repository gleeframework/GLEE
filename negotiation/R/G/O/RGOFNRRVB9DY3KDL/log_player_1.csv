"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's closer to the value Bob places on the product, hoping to entice him to accept the offer. However, it's still higher than my minimum price, so I can still make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is a better offer than John's, it's still below my minimum threshold of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures that I can still make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with $85. This is my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a good deal for Bob as the product is worth $100 to him. This compromise shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $78 is still a bit low for me, though. How about we split the difference and go with $81? This way, we both get closer to our desired price."", ""product_price"": 81}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $81. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still allows me to make a profit. It shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price."
