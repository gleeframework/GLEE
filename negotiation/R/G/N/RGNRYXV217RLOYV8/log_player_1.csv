"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept right away. This gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe there's room to negotiate further and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, it's a significant increase from his previous offer and we're nearing the middle ground.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly better price, but the risk of Bob walking away or me running out of rounds outweighs the potential gain.  It's important to secure a sale, and $11,500 is a good outcome."
