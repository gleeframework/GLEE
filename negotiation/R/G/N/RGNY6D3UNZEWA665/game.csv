"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be more affordable. Would you consider a lower price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
