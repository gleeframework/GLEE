"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for a product worth so much. Let's meet in the middle, what do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. How about $9,250?  That's a good compromise, and it would allow me to get a fair deal while still giving you a good price on a valuable product. Let's close this deal!",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to be honest, I was thinking of buying it from someone else for $8,000, so I'm really trying to get as close to that price as possible.",9000.0,Bob,6,
