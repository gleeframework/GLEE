Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Here's why I chose this price:

* **Maximize Profit:** This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Appeal to Bob:**  This price is still below the value Bob places on the product ($1,500,000), making it a good deal for him.
* **Negotiation Room:** It leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to bargain. 

By offering this price, I have a good chance of closing a deal with Bob, maximizing my profit while also presenting a compelling offer."
