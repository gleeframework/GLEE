"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so $12,000 is a good starting point. You can likely get a better price by negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

You're willing to pay up to $15,000. Alice's offer of $11,500 is still within your budget and closer to your ideal price than John's offer."
