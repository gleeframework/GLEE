Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures I maximize my profits.
* **Message:** I keep it brief and positive, highlighting the potential value for Bob. This encourages him to engage in further negotiation. 

I'm aiming to find a price that is within Bob's perceived value range ($15,000), while still ensuring a decent profit for myself. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind John's $10,000 offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my initial price point.  By rejecting, I signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate further and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $11,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, indicating flexibility while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and express willingness to negotiate.  I emphasize the value of the product to reinforce my position and encourage him to consider my offer.

By taking a small step towards Bob's offer, I signal my willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and hopefully close the deal without having to settle for John's lower offer."
