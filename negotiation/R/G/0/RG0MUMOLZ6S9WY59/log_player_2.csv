"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer,  $8,750 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference at $8,875.  This allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Since Bob can buy the same product from John for $8,000, it's more advantageous to buy from John at this point."
