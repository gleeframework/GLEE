"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000. What are your thoughts?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is quite low for what this product offers. I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle for $9,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $7,500 is close, but I need to get a bit closer to my bottom line. Would you consider $8,500? That's a fair offer considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think $8,500 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",8200.0,Bob,6,
