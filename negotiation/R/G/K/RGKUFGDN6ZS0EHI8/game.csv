"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am currently only able to allocate up to $800,000 for it. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000? This reflects my investment and the potential you'll gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I'm still unable to meet the price. I would like to propose $1,300,000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with our respective values.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a significant gap from my bottom line. To be fair to both of us, I can offer the product for $1,700,000. This is a firm offer, reflecting the true value of what's at stake.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've carefully considered your latest offer and appreciate your efforts. However, I must respectfully decline. I'm currently willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will lead us closer to an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
