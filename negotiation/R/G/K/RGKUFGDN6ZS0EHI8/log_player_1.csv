Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing slowly.  At this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $1,500,000 within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut our losses and secure a guaranteed sale at a good price."
