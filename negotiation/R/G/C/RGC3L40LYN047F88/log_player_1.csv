"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe that Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it's still less than the value he places on the product ($120)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm countering with $100.  This is a compromise from my initial offer and still leaves room for Bob to make a profit. I'm confident this price is fair and will encourage Bob to accept."
