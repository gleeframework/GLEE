"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be happy to consider purchasing for $850000.  This price reflects the value to me while also offering you a healthy profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than you're offering. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a great deal, while also ensuring I get a reasonable profit. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
