Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I believe I can push for a slightly higher price and secure a more favorable outcome. I will counteroffer again, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price."

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and while I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $845,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and having to sell to John for a lower price.  I'm going to accept his offer."
