Round 2

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $87.50 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $89? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $87. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $88.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum, and I'm getting closer to my goal with each round.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing too hard, and I'm still getting a better price than what John is offering."
