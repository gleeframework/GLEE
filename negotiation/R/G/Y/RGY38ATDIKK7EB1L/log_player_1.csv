Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your decision, as this offer stands until [Set a reasonable deadline, e.g., end of the day tomorrow]."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Setting a deadline creates a sense of urgency, prompting Bob to act quickly. The mention of exclusivity further implies this is a time-sensitive opportunity.
* **Confident Tone:**  Your message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive or more passive), adjust your approach accordingly.
* **Relationship Building:** While aiming for the best price is key, consider the long-term implications.  If a strong relationship with Bob is important, you might adopt a slightly less aggressive starting point."
