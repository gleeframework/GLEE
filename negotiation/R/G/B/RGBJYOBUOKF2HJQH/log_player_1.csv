Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 150}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $130 is still below my desired price, and I'm not sure he's willing to go higher. However, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll try one more counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $130 is still not quite enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to counter with $135. This price aligns more closely with my budget while still recognizing the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer $140, $135 is closer to my desired price than $130, and it's within the range I'm willing to accept. I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
