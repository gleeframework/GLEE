"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the interest. However, $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm prepared to offer $10500 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $11000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",11750.0,Alice,5,
