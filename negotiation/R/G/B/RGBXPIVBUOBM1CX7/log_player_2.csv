Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we are getting close to the end of the negotiations.  While I could keep negotiating, I'm concerned that I won't be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with.  It's safer to go with John's offer, which guarantees the product at my maximum price."
