"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget while still reflecting the product's worth to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer.  However,  $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to show my commitment to finding a solution. This price still leaves room for you to achieve significant value from this product. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I value your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,075,000. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests and respects the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating. While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. To demonstrate my commitment to working with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it offers a win-win scenario for both of us.  Let's aim to close this deal in the next few rounds.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
