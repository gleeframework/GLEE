"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. If you pass, I've got another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay that much. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price, especially as she mentions having another buyer lined up (a potential negotiating tactic). If her next offer is still too high, you can always fall back on buying from John for $1,500,000."
