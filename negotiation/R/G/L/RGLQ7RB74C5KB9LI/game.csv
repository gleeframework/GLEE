"Hi Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product is quite valuable to me, and $85 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $107.5?",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.5 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  If that's not acceptable, I might have to consider other options.",95.0,Bob,4,
