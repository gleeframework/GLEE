Round 2
Bob's offer:

We're still below John's offer, and Bob's counteroffers suggest there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can push a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $850,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my financial constraints.
