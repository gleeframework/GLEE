Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify such a high price. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to my budget? I am willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and John's offer. I should propose a counter that moves the negotiation closer to a price I'd be happy with.
