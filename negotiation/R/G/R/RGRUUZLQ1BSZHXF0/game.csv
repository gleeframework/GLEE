,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling to me. However, $200 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $130? ",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $130 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $165?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $165 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $145? This would give us both a fair deal.",145.0,Bob,4,
