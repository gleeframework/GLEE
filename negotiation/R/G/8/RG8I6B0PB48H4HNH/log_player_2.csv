"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and potential impact, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a price that is significantly below its market value of $1,200,000. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I aim to be accommodating, I must also ensure a fair return for my efforts and investment. Considering the high value of the product and the benefits it offers, I am proposing a revised price of $900,000. This still represents a significant discount from the market value and allows us to explore a potential partnership. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down from her original price, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."

Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually agreeable price. In light of your latest offer, I am pleased to propose a price of $885,000 for the product. This remains a favorable deal for both parties, taking into account the value it brings to your business while ensuring a reasonable profit for us. I hope this proposal aligns with your financial considerations and looks forward to your positive response.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is just above Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential for further savings is limited.  It's likely that any further negotiation will be time-consuming and could result in a stalemate. Accepting the offer saves Bob money compared to buying from John and secures the product."
