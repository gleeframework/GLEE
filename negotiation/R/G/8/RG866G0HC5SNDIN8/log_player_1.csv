"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant amount close to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as he values the product at $1,200,000, and it's higher than my minimum.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a slightly higher price.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm not quite ready to settle for this price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I'm still trying to get a higher price than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is only slightly higher than what John is offering.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  It's not the ideal outcome, but it's better than risking getting stuck with a lower price."
