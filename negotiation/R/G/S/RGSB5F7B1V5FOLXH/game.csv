"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to secure a better deal. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this point.  I'm prepared to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle.  I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still ensuring a fair return for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $900,000 is closer to my target, I believe we can still find a more favorable price. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's make this deal work for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest.  However, $875,000 is still below the value I need to accept.  To show my willingness to finalize a deal, I'm willing to offer the product for $890,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this now.",890000.0,Alice,5,
