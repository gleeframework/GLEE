"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $7,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $6,800. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",6800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to split the difference to close this out - would you do $6,700?",6700.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $6,700. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $6,900. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",6900.0,Alice,7,
