Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, I'm not yet willing to settle for a price that low. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hoping it's a reasonable compromise. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
