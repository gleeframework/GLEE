"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a different idea of the value. While I appreciate your offer, I can't accept $1,200,000. It's below my minimum threshold. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  I believe this price reflects the product's unique qualities and is still a good deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hoping it's a reasonable compromise. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
