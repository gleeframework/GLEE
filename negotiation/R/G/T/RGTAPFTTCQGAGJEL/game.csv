"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for it.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a great value for this unique product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is my final offer, as I'm very close to my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11200. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11200.0,Alice,5,
