Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant ROI for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield a better outcome.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,300,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving us room for negotiation.
    *  Lower than John's offer, incentivizing Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, subtly influencing Bob's perception.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a premium price and having the safety net of John's offer."
