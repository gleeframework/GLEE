"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really enjoy.  I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You'll save $10 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
