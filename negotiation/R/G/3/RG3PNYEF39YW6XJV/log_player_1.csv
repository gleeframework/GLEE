Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to the value Bob places on the product ($15,000) than my minimum ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By starting at $12,000, I leave room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling like I'm giving away too much.  
* **Maintaining my minimum:** This offer is still significantly above my minimum price, so I'm confident I'll get a profit even if Bob counters. 

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter again. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $8,000 gives me confidence to negotiate more aggressively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my desired profit:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I aim for. I want to maximize my profit.
* **Room for a counteroffer:** I can still counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my initial offer.
* **John is a backup:** Knowing I have John as a backup option if things don't work out with Bob gives me the leverage to negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000, but still slightly lower than his counteroffer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to sell for significantly less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about $11,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Profit and Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise but not give up too much. It's a middle ground between Bob's offer and my previous offer. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  By offering $11,000, I'm still above my minimum of $8,000 and closer to my ideal profit.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Moving:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation process alive and avoids immediately selling to John, potentially getting a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's reaction to this counteroffer and be ready to accept or make another counteroffer depending on his response.
* **John Remains a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can still sell to John for $8,000 gives me the confidence to stand firm if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
