{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the deal for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The price is not my absolute bottom line, allowing for potential counteroffers and a negotiation process. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I won't go too low and risk losing out on a guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a price closer to my desired value. 
* **John's offer provides leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me confidence to stand firm and potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway though. How about $9,000?  This still represents a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but not accepting it.  I'm proposing a middle ground that still benefits me while potentially appealing to Bob.
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:** I'm reminding Bob of the deal he's getting at $9,000, emphasizing the value to him.
* **Maintaining flexibility:** $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:** I'm not dropping too low, ensuring I don't lose out on the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $10,000 I could get from John. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** I have a strong backup option with John, so I can continue negotiating without feeling pressured.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room to push for a higher price, potentially getting closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $8,750 is still too far from what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $9,250. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest and allows me to move forward.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm standing my ground but offering a slight concession, showing flexibility while still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Appealing to Bob's logic:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" that acknowledges his interest and allows him to get a good deal.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:**  I'm trying to avoid a situation where we keep going back and forth with small adjustments.  This offer shows a clear point of compromise.
* **Maintaining John's offer as leverage:**  This offer is still above my minimum, keeping John's offer as a safety net if negotiations break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet on this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for further negotiation:** We've reached a point where Bob's offer is consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and it's unlikely he'll budge further.
* **Guarantee from John:**  Selling to John provides a guaranteed $10,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer and meets my minimum requirement. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take more time and effort without a guaranteed better outcome.  Selling to John ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
