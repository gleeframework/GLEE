Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $13,000?

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

It's time to cut bait. Alice has indicated this is her lowest price and it's still higher than John's offer. There's no guarantee of getting below $13,000 with Alice even with more rounds.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at your target price."
