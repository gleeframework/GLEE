"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $14,000. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $17,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we settle at $16,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
