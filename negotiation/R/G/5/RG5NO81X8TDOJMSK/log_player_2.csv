Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way above his budget and he can get a better deal from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Bob should start with a counteroffer close to his maximum budget. This shows Alice he's serious but also leaves some room for negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price.  He should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

Bob should counter with $9,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and he can still walk away and buy from John if Alice rejects."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $9,200 is a good price, and he's getting closer to his budget. If he rejects and goes back and forth, he might risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at $8,000."
