Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $900,000 is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being a substantial profit for me.
* **Appealing to Value:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to counter without immediately resorting to John as a backup. 
* **Flexibility:** This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and adjust my tactics accordingly. If Bob rejects, I can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's not even close to the $800,000 value it holds for Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's rejection is a setback, it doesn't automatically mean selling to John is the best option. I can still try to negotiate a more favorable price with Bob.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that bridges the gap and explores the possibility of a mutually acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, hopefully finding a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too far below the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still represents a good deal for you.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Appealing to value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value again, reminding Bob of the benefit he'd gain from acquiring it.
* **Final offer feel:**  While I'm open to further negotiation, the message subtly implies that this is a good final offer, putting pressure on Bob to consider it seriously.

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards a decision. If he accepts, I get a good price. If he rejects, it may signal a need to move on to John, but I'm still in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch outside my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $825,000?  I think that would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $825,000 is very close to my desired $800,000 minimum. It's a substantial profit for me and a good deal for Bob.
* **Risk of escalation:**  While I could counteroffer again, it's possible Bob will dig in his heels, or I might risk losing him entirely.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a lower offer or even a stalemate.  

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice at this point. It's a good price, and I minimize the risk of a drawn-out negotiation or losing a potential buyer."
