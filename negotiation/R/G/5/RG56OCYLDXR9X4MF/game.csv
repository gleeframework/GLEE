"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too far below the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still represents a good deal for you.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch outside my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $825,000?  I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
