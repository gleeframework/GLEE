"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $10,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer.  $10,500 is still too high for him. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get a better deal. He is willing to pay $9,000, and Alice is offering $10,000. There is still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $9,500 for the product. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's closer to his desired price, he's still only $500 away from his maximum budget. It's worth trying to get a lower price before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $9,500 is closer to where I'm at, but I'm still hoping to get it for $9,000.  This price point is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still holding out for $9,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $9,250 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's only $250 over his budget, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower.  If he rejects, he risks having to buy from John at $8,000, which would be a worse deal overall."
