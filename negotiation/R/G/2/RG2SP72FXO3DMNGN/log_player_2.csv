"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still higher than the product's worth to you ($120). You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($120).  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's split the difference and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $107.50. It's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $107.50 is still within my budget of $120.  While I'd prefer to pay less, I'm not sure I can get a significantly better price from her.  If I reject this offer, we may go back and forth for a while, and I may end up paying more than $107.50.  It's also possible that Alice might get frustrated and refuse to negotiate further, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer seems like the most prudent choice."
