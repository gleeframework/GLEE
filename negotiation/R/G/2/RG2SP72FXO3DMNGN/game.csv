"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $107.50. It's the best I can do.",107.5,Alice,5,
