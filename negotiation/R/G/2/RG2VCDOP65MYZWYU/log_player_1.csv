"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this offer. This allows me to gauge his interest and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, or sell to John for a higher price if necessary.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see where it leads."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable amount. This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for much less than what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my target, but I still believe I can do better. While selling to John would guarantee a higher price, I'm not yet ready to give up on the negotiation with Bob.  I'll continue to counteroffer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm dropping my price again, but I'm getting closer to Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to try and bridge the gap. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's time to secure the deal with John."
