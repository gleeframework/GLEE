Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I need to consider Bob's offer carefully. He's willing to pay $115, which is a decent profit above my minimum. However, there's a chance I could get more. 

Let's try a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
