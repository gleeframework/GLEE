"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your generosity,  $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to offer $10,750, which is closer to my budget and, I think, fair considering the value we've both discussed. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
