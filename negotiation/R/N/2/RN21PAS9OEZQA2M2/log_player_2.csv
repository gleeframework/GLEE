"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to make a deal, and Bob has a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. A counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer.  It's still above Alice's minimum price of $1,000,000, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  This counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject this offer and continue to try and lower the price. There are still 7 rounds left to negotiate, and Bob's fallback option with John provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's last offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's previous offer of $1,050,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still trying to achieve a lower price. It's important to keep in mind that there are still 6 rounds left, and Bob has John as a backup option if he can't reach a suitable price with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's preferred range.  There are still 5 rounds left to negotiate, and Bob has a safety net with John.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to Alice's offer. By offering $1,100,000, Bob shows his willingness to compromise while also keeping some space for further negotiation. With 4 rounds left, Bob can still try to nudge the price down a bit more.  However, it's important to note that the longer the negotiation goes on, the more likely it becomes that Alice will stick to her price."
