"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you will find incredibly valuable. Given its worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering its significant potential for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can get a better price from John. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $800,000. If she doesn't offer a lower price, you can always fall back on buying from John for $1,200,000."
