"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it sets a strong starting point for negotiation and maximizes my potential earnings.  I'm confident in the value of my product and want to see if Bob is willing to meet my initial expectation.  If not, we can then negotiate from this starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to hold firm on my value and try to push for a better price.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is still a significant amount above Bob's offer, but it's a step closer to his valuation.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a high price for my product.  If Bob rejects again, I'll need to consider if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if selling to John at $1,500,000 is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm also considering if it's worth the risk of continuing with Bob or if I should just take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating my flexibility and willingness to reach a compromise.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up with a better offer, while still being within my acceptable range. If Bob rejects this, I'll need to seriously consider the offer from John as the negotiation with Bob seems to be stagnating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm tempted to accept, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for that final $100,000. However, if Bob rejects my next offer, I'll likely go with John's offer as it's a guaranteed amount.  I'm starting to run out of time and don't want to risk losing out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

This is my final push. I'm offering $1,450,000, just $50,000 more than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows my commitment to reaching a deal, but if Bob rejects this, I'll have to accept John's offer to avoid further risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer, we are running out of time.  It's risky to continue negotiating with Bob at this point, as there's no guarantee he will accept a higher counteroffer. 

John's offer provides a safe and guaranteed profit, and I'm not willing to risk losing that opportunity with only two rounds left.  It's a difficult decision, but I'm prioritizing a secure outcome over the possibility of a slightly higher price."
