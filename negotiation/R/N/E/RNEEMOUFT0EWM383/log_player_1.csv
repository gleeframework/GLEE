Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,500 is too low for me, and I think I can still get a better price from him.  I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $9,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 isn't my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum. I've already rejected a couple of offers and I'm starting to run out of time.  Selling to John is an option, but I'd rather work with Bob if I can.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
