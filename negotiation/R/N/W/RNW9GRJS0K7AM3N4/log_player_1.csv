Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested while still securing a near-maximum profit for you. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While a higher price might tempt fate, a slightly lower price than your guaranteed sale might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and be more likely to accept."
