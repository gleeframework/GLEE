,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. ",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is my absolute minimum. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's close this deal and make it happen. ",100.0,Alice,5,
