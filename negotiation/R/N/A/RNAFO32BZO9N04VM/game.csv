"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been holding onto for a while, and I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,1,
