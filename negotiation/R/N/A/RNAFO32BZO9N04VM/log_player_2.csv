"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been holding onto for a while, and I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

The product is worth $15,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $16,000. This is more than you're willing to pay.  You can get the same product from John for $15,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
