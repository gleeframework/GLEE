"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth negotiating further to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a bit closer to the original price I had in mind. What do you think?

While $1,100,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum.  There's still room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiation, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. However, I was thinking that $1,000,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $1,050,000 to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer and closer to your budget, you can still attempt to negotiate a lower price.  You've already demonstrated your willingness to pay close to your maximum, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  There's potential for a further agreement that benefits both parties."
