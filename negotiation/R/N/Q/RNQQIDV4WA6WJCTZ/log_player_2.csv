"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to enhance your daily life. It comes with advanced features that cater to a wide range of needs. Considering its exceptional quality and functionality, I propose a price of $85 for it. I believe this is a fair offer given its value. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good price, it's worth seeing if you can get it lower.  You have a strong fallback option with John, so there's no need to rush into accepting the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $85 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $70 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 70}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to consider your offer. To provide a compromise, I would like to suggest a price of $75 for the product. This reflects a middle ground between our initial offers. I hope this proposal works for you, and I look forward to your feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $75, which is within my budget and a good compromise.  Since I have a backup option with John, I don't need to push for a lower price and risk losing the deal."
