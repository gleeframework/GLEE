Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll get from it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is closer to my target of maximizing profits, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $950,000 is a good starting point because it allows for counteroffers without going below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. This aligns closely with its value to me, and I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is to maximize profits. While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to the $950,000 I initially offered.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price.
* **Counteroffer Potential:**  Even if Bob is set on $800,000, I can still use my counteroffer to gauge his true willingness to pay and possibly find a compromise.
* **John as a Backup:**  John's offer of $800,000 serves as a safety net, so I'm not losing out on any money by rejecting Bob's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $850,000? This would give you a great deal on the product and still allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer, but still trying to secure a higher price than Bob's offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product at this price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** My message is open-ended, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your follow-up offer. While I understand your desire to maintain your profit margin, I'm still committed to finding a balance. I'm willing to increase my offer to $825,000. This proposal reflects a compromise that could work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is only $25,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:** While I would have preferred to get closer to $950,000, accepting Bob's offer allows me to lock in a sale and still make a substantial profit.
* **Risk of Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I would be forced to sell to John for $800,000. 
* **Time Factor:**  It's possible that further negotiation could take time and potentially reduce the value of the product to me over time. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option at this point, balancing a good profit with the potential risks of further negotiation."
