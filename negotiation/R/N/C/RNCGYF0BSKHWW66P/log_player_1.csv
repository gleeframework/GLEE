"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident Bob will find this price attractive, given the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired range. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, even though we're getting closer to my minimum. I'll counteroffer again, hoping Bob will come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm counteroffering again at $100.  With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to secure a deal closer to $105."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm choosing to reject his offer, hoping I can still secure a better deal with only 4 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is my final attempt to get a price closer to my initial target. With only 3 rounds left, I need to start considering selling to John if this offer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds left, it's clear that Bob won't budge on his price.  While I would prefer to get more, selling to John is the most practical option.  I'll secure my minimum acceptable price and avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely."
