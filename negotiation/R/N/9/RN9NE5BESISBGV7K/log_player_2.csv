You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is my final offer.

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price.  He should try to negotiate further, aiming for his maximum of $8,000."
