Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $12,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident I can get this product for $8,000 elsewhere. Is there any flexibility at all in your price? I'm really keen on this product, but I simply can't go higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is firm at $8,000 and unwilling to budge. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely he'll meet the $10,000 minimum. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is the best option at this point."
