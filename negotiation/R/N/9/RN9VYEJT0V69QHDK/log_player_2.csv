"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better price than John's $150, you can still potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is a reasonable compromise between Alice's asking price of $140 and my maximum budget of $150. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still giving me a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer to $142, which is only slightly better than her initial offer. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and I'm already at my maximum budget of $150, I'll buy from John instead. There's a high chance that further negotiation with Alice will only lead to a higher price, and I don't want to risk exceeding my budget."
