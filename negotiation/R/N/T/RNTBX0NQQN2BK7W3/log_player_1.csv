"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It also allows for room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm to a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous counteroffer, and I'm hoping it will be enough to entice Bob to accept.  At this point, I'm getting a bit nervous about the possibility of Bob rejecting my offer again.  I need to find a balance between getting a good price and not risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only $50,000 over my minimum acceptable price, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, I risk him walking away entirely.  We're nearing the end of our rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000. It's better to secure the deal now at $1,050,000."
