Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (any less and you're better off with John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept while still maximizing your profit. Since you have a backup offer, you can afford to start higher. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message aims to:
    * Highlight the product's value.
    * Introduce a sense of urgency (limited-time offer).
    * Subtly imply competition without revealing John's exact offer.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate.
    * Still within a reasonable range for Bob to consider, especially if the ""unique value"" resonates.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a smaller starting price difference.

**Remember:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
