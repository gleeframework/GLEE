"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $12500. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $12000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still out of my price range. I'm sticking with my offer of $10000. This is a fair price considering you value the product at $12000 and I'm willing to pay a premium. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
