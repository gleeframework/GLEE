# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $12,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $12500. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $12000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget.  You're still willing to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price, especially since you have more rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still out of my price range. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. This is a fair price considering you value the product at $12,000 and I'm willing to pay a premium. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you the product for $11750. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is still above your budget of $10,000. You have limited rounds left, and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to budge much further. At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the product from John at your target price of $10,000."
