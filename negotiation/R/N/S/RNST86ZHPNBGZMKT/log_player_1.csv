Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we are getting closer, $9,500 is still too far below my desired price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9,500 still leaves me feeling like I'm not getting a fair deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,250 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling it for less than $10,000. I have a few more rounds to try and push for a better deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We're getting very close to a deal with Bob, but it's taking too long and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price below my minimum.  John is a guaranteed sale at my target price, so it's the best decision for me at this point."
