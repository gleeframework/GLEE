"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1150000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1050000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider this offer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $1050000 is still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1180000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1100000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider this offer.",1100000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1100000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit short of my target price. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to close the deal. I'm thinking of a price of $1190000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1190000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm not willing to pay $1190000. I'm afraid I'll have to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to walk away from the deal and buy the product from John for $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
