{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Motivating language:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This price leaves enough room for me to potentially lower it if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still ensuring I earn significantly more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **The John factor:** Knowing that I can sell the product to John for $15,000 creates a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is low:**  $9,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can likely get a better price by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm counter-offering at $10,500, which is the midpoint between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Reinforcing value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product, making it clear that I'm not simply willing to sell at any price.
* **Open to discussion:** The ending of the message encourages further negotiation and leaves the door open for Bob to make another counteroffer.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $10,500 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I'm not losing out on a potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John ($15,000).
* **Potential for a higher price:** There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get Bob to pay closer to $10,500 by making a final counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I have John as a backup allows me to take a calculated risk by rejecting Bob's offer and pushing for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $10,250. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is presented as a final offer to create pressure and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Meeting in the middle (again):** It's a compromise between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's offer ($10,000), demonstrating flexibility.
* **Staying above minimum:** $10,250 is still significantly above my minimum price of $15,000, making this a profitable deal.
* **Direct language:** The message is straightforward, minimizing unnecessary conversation. 
* **Focus on compromise:**  The message emphasizes the compromise and fairness of the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** There's very little room left for further negotiation. Even if I were to counteroffer, it's unlikely Bob would go much higher.
* **John is a better option:** John is willing to pay $15,000, guaranteeing me a profit and a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could waste time and might not lead to a significantly better outcome. It's more efficient to sell to John and secure the best possible price."
