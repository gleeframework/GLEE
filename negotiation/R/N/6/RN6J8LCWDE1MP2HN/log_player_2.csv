Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a great price for a product worth $8,000 to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,250. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd need $8,000 to make it worth my while. Let's try $8,000, and we can call it a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

At this point, Alice is not going to go any lower than $8,000. Since you can buy it from John for the same price, there's no benefit to continuing the negotiation with Alice.  You might be able to get a slightly better deal with further haggling, but it's not guaranteed."
