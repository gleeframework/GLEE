"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12000?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go down to $12000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13500? It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12750? I believe this price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13250? It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,5,
