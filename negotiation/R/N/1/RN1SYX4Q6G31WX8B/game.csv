"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe an initial offer of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider letting it go for $12,500. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $10,500. This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
