Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, the offer is still a bit high.  Bob has a few rounds left and should continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  There's still a chance he can close the deal for closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is pushing hard to get the best price.  He's getting close to his maximum budget, but he's hoping to save as much as possible.  Offering $9,250 shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to pay a fair price, but also that he's not willing to go much higher. This counteroffer could be the final push for Alice to accept, as it's only a small step away from her last offer."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round remaining, the negotiation has reached a stalemate.  Alice's offer of $9,600 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's unlikely that Alice will accept another counteroffer and agree to a price below her last offer.  Therefore, the best option for Bob is to buy the product from John for $8,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids risking further negotiation that might not yield a better result."
