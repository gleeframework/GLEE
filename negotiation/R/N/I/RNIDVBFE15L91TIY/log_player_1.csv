""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm asking for $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's valuation.
* **Balancing Potential Profit:** This price allows you to potentially gain a profit of $150,000 over John's offer while still being enticing enough for Bob to consider.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price, knowing you have a backup buyer."
