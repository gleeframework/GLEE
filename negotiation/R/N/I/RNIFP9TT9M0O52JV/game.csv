"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $9,500? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's try to meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. How about $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
