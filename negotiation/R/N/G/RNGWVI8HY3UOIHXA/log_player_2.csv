"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

$1,100,000 is way too high for Bob's budget. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think.

While $1,025,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer.  While $950,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price if you can agree to [insert a small, easily agreeable term here, like a positive product review or a future referral]. It's a significant discount, and that small addition would make a difference for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While $950,000 is still quite a bit above Bob's preferred price, it's likely that the ""small, easily agreeable term"" won't be a major burden for Bob.  It's a good deal compared to the $800,000 price from John."
