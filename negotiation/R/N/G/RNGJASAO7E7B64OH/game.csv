"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I think you'll find it's worth far more than that in the long run, but I'm willing to offer this price for a quick and easy sale.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. If that's not workable, let me know what you might be able to do.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with it for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $7,000? I feel that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  This product is worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I believe that's closer to $9,000.  If you're willing to meet me at that price, we have a deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
