"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1300000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would help me get closer to my target price. Let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
