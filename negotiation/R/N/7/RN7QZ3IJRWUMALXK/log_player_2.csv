"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We want to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for further negotiation. This approach aims to bring the price closer to our desired range while gauging Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but $115 is still above our target. We should continue negotiating to try and get the price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. How about $105? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:** We are nudging the price closer to our target of $100 while acknowledging Alice's desire for a higher price. This offer keeps the negotiation moving and maintains a collaborative tone."
