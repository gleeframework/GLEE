"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth attempting to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While $1,250,000 is a decent offer, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get closer to his desired price by making another counteroffer.  It's worth attempting to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
