,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 undervalues the unique aspects and benefits of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
