"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This gives you room to negotiate downwards while still securing a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""unique value and potential,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth, even if your initial price is above his perceived value.
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This first offer is also about understanding how Bob intends to negotiate. His reaction will reveal whether he's looking for a bargain, a fair deal, or if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you. While his offer is a clear indication he's aiming for a lower price, there's still room for negotiation. Selling to John guarantees your minimum, but it's too early to settle for that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** A $200,000 reduction from your initial offer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:** By mentioning the ""true potential"" again, you're subtly anchoring the product's value above Bob's offer, pushing him towards a higher price point. 
* **""Mutually Beneficial"":** This phrase emphasizes your aim for a fair deal, not just maximizing your own profit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation while keeping the price well above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need the price to be more in line with my budget.  Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below your $1,200,000 minimum. This slow progress suggests it might be challenging to bridge the gap quickly.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a firm offer from John at your minimum acceptable price. While a deal with Bob is still possible, the risk of him not reaching your minimum within the remaining rounds is growing. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** Rejecting this offer shows Bob that you're serious about the value you place on the product and are not desperate to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $950,000 is too far below its true worth for me. I'm open to finding a middle ground, but I need to see a significant movement from your side.  Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** The message is more direct about the offer being too low, but maintains a professional and respectful tone. 
* **""Significant Movement"":**  This emphasizes the need for Bob to make a larger step towards your acceptable range. 
* **Strategic Price:**  $1,250,000 is a strong position.  It's a small concession from your last counteroffer but still above your minimum. It also allows you to potentially negotiate down to your $1,200,000 minimum if needed.
* **Time Consideration:**  With half the rounds remaining, it's important to push for a deal closer to your terms, especially with John's guaranteed offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my upper limit for this purchase.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering your asking price and the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Far Apart:** While Bob's offer is increasing, it's still $150,000 below your minimum. Accepting would be a significant loss compared to John's offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds remaining, the pressure is on for Bob to make substantial moves. A rejection signals this urgency.
* **""Upper Limit"" Tactic:** Bob mentioning his ""upper limit"" could be a negotiation tactic. Don't let it pressure you into accepting a less favorable deal.

**Next Steps:**

You have a strong position with John's offer. In the next round, you should strongly consider either getting Bob very close to your minimum or taking John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. However, the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I'm willing to make my final offer: $1,180,000. This reflects my sincere desire to close this deal with you, while also recognizing the product's inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1180000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  With limited rounds remaining, making a ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes your commitment to a price close to your minimum. 
* **Slight Concession:** Moving down to $1,180,000 is a reasonable concession, showing flexibility but maintaining a price above your absolute minimum.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the ""inherent value"" reinforces the product's worth and explains your position.
* **Pressure on Bob:** This offer puts the pressure on Bob to either accept a reasonable deal or risk losing out entirely.

**Outcome:**

This strategy aims to either:

* **Secure a Deal:**  Bob might be motivated to accept this ""final offer"" to avoid missing out. 
* **Guide Bob's Counter:** If Bob counteroffers, it will likely be very close to your desired price, allowing you to either accept or walk away with John's guaranteed offer."
