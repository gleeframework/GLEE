"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is respectful of Alice's offer while clearly stating Bob's position. 
* **Strategic:**  By starting low, Bob increases the chances of securing a price significantly lower than $8,000 (John's price)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Price:** Alice's offer of $8,500 is very close to John's price of $8,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still a chance to negotiate a slightly lower price from Alice, making it worthwhile to continue the negotiation for at least one more round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $7,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's current offer ($8,500) and Bob's previous offer ($6,000). 
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is concise and gets straight to the point of offering a compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps Bob below his maximum budget while still potentially appealing to Alice as a reasonable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Price:** Alice has now met Bob's alternative option of buying from John for $8,000. 
* **No Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate for a lower price is unlikely to be successful and risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures the product at Bob's target price."
