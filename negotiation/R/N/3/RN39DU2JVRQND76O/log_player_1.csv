{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging, highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting high to maximize my potential profit.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation to avoid a quick rejection.
* I'm keeping John as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a huge loss. It's better to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer of $1,100,000, potentially offering a slight concession to show I'm willing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for closer to $1,050,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still protecting my bottom line. It's also a fair middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone while firmly stating my position. I'm emphasizing the value Bob would still be getting and highlighting that this price is necessary for me. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm using a strategy of gradually decreasing my offer to show flexibility.
* I'm keeping the pressure on Bob by reminding him of the value of the product. 
* I'm still keeping John as my fallback option in case the negotiation falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is my top limit. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to take such a big loss on this product. 

**Next Steps:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I will likely counter his offer again, but I will need to be strategic about how much I'm willing to decrease my price. I also need to be mindful of the fact that John is still an option if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
