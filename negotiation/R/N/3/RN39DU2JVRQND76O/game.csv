,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for closer to $1,050,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is my top limit. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Can you meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $1,000,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
