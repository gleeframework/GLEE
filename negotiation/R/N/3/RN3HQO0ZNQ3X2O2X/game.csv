"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $12,500. This is a fair price considering you're still getting a profit, and it's a good starting point for us to find common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,500. Considering its value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $14,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product. This is a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal while still allowing you a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $13,800. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget while still giving me a decent profit. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",13800.0,Alice,5,
