Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,500. Considering its value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $14,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $13,800. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget while still giving me a decent profit. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $13,800 is still too high.  I've already negotiated for a few rounds, and it seems like we're not getting any closer.  At this point, it's better to buy from John for $12,000."
