"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $10,000. This saves you $2,000.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:** While you'll definitely get the product, buying from John costs more than Alice's offer."
