"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is higher than the value to Bob but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer as fair and beneficial for both of us. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm not demanding a specific price but inviting Bob to discuss. 

**Strategy:**

I'm setting a high starting point, but I'm open to negotiation.  My goal is to quickly assess Bob's interest and move towards a mutually agreeable price. If he's not willing to come close to my desired price, I'll be prepared to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While $900,000 is a step closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my target. 
* **Opportunity to Counter:** I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer, which gives me more control over the negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  I'll try to bridge the gap but maintain a price that's closer to my desired value. If Bob continues to be unwilling to come closer to my desired price, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer to show flexibility while still maintaining a high price. 
* **Bridging the Gap:**  $1,100,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to both of us.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:** I'm seeing how much Bob is willing to budge. 
* **Maintain a Reserve:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm giving Bob some space to negotiate. 
* **Prepare for John:** If Bob won't meet me closer to $1,100,000, I'll be prepared to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $950,000 is closer but still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than what John is offering. 
* **John's Offer Remains:** I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John.  Bob is getting closer but hasn't reached that point yet.
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  I have another round to try and negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll try to bridge the gap again but will stay above my minimum price. If Bob doesn't come up to at least $1,000,000, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum price. To show my willingness to find a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. I believe this is a win-win situation, and I hope we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Minimum:**  I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 but showing some flexibility by offering a slight reduction to $1,050,000.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to convince him to increase his offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone, trying to encourage a deal while still asserting my price point.

**Strategy:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making a final push to get Bob closer to my price. I'm hoping he sees the value in closing this deal.
* **John as a Backup:** I'm aware I can still sell to John for $1,000,000. This gives me leverage in negotiations.
* **Prepare for Next Round:**  If Bob still refuses, I'm ready to reassess the situation and consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Below Minimum:** $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:** I have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob if I can secure that amount.
* **Limited Time:** We're approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds, and time is running out. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John.  While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, it's more important to secure a sale at this point."
