"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. This price is significantly higher than my minimum value, but I believe it's still within a reasonable range for a potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to meet him halfway and potentially close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum value, and with only 6 rounds remaining, I believe it's in my best interest to accept his offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, securing a deal at $1,700,000 is a good outcome.  There's always a chance Bob will make a lower counteroffer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
