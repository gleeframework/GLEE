"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1050000 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1100000. This still gives you a significant advantage, and I'm confident it's a price that will allow us to both walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for you. It's lower than what you'd pay John ($1,200,000), and it's likely that further negotiation won't bring the price down much more.  It's in your best interest to accept this offer and secure the product."
