"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
