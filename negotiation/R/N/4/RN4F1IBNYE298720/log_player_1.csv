"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This is a reasonable starting offer. It's above your minimum of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation and still gives Bob a good deal since it's below the value he places on the product.  Let's see if we can get closer to $12,000!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're still above our minimum value with Bob, and he's shown he's willing to negotiate.  Let's see if we can push him a little closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
``` 

We're still leaving some room for negotiation, but moving closer to our target price. This counteroffer shows we're willing to compromise while also demonstrating that we value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to our minimum, it's still worth trying to push for a little more. We've shown willingness to negotiate and there are still rounds left. Let's see if we can get closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

We're getting closer to a deal and showing flexibility. This counteroffer is still a good price for Bob, but we're pushing for the $11,000 mark.  Let's see if he's willing to meet us halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While we're still above our minimum value with Bob, we've reached a point where the negotiations are becoming less fruitful.  We've had 5 rounds of negotiation, and the gap between our offers and Bob's is narrowing.  John is a sure bet for $10,000.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing a deal with John, it's wiser to sell the product to John and secure the guaranteed $10,000."
