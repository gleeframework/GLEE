"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $850,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let's make this happen!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $775,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. Let's compromise at $825,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
