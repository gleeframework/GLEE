"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
