It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're reaching the limit:** We're past the halfway point in negotiations, and Alice is unlikely to move significantly lower. 
* **Strong savings:**  $670,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to push could make Alice less willing to negotiate, risking the entire deal."
