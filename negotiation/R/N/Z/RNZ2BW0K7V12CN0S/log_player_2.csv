"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $12000. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is at Bob's maximum budget, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price.  This establishes a negotiating range.
* **Reasonable Counter:** $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It leaves room for Alice to counter and for Bob to make further concessions if necessary. 
* **Communication:**  Bob's message is polite but firm, acknowledging the value of the product while expressing his financial constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to both of us, how about $11500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Seeking a Better Deal:** Bob wants to try and get a lower price, possibly around $11,000. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue the negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, the potential savings outweigh the risk at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** Bob is making a smaller counteroffer this time, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good price. 
* **Justifying the Offer:** Bob reiterates the value of the product and his budget limitations, making his offer seem more reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains polite and positive, fostering a collaborative negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After careful consideration, I would like to propose $11200 as the price for the product. I hope this meets within your budget while also ensuring a fair return for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has come down further, and the offer is now only $200 above Bob's last counteroffer.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  Alice may not be willing to budge further.
* **Acceptable Price:** $11,200 is within Bob's budget, and represents a significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer or buying from John.  Accepting ensures a deal and saves time."
