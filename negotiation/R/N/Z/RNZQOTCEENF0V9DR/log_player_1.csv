I will reject Bob's offer because it's below my minimum threshold of $80. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired $80 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $80? That's my absolute minimum, and it would make this a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}

It's getting close, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I've only got 4 rounds left and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $80 from John. I'm going to sell to John."
