"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a clear upper limit of $15,000, so you can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point.  Accepting the $13,000 offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John, and it's still a good deal for you."
