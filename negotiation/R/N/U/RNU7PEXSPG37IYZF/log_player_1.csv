{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100).  This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.  It's also important to build a rapport with Bob and express my belief that the product would be a good fit for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider letting me purchase it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is above my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's still slightly lower than my initial offer, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $95 is a good start, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 102.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your current offer. I would like to propose $97.50 as my final offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $97.5 is only $2.50 below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up selling to John for $100. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather secure the sale."
