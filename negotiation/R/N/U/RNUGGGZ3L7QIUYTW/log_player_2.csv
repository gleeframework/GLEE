{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth exploring if I can get a better price from Alice.  $85 is a good starting point, but I can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $70. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $80 is still a bit high. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}

I'm going to raise my offer slightly to $75. It's a small increase, but hopefully, it will be enough to entice Alice to accept and avoid further back and forth."

```

Alice's offer is still a bit too high.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can get closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 77}
```

I'm going to split the difference and offer $77. This shows I'm serious about buying from Alice but am still trying to get a good price."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $83.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still being stubborn. While I don't want to risk running out of rounds, $83 is still too high. I'll counteroffer again, but if she rejects this, I might have to start considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 79}
```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer at $79. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Alice will finally accept to avoid further negotiations and the risk of me going to John."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Alice seems determined to stay above my desired price.  I'm going to take John's offer at $150. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking another round and potentially losing the chance to buy the product altogether."
