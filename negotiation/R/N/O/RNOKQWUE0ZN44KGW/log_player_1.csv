Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $18,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation. 
* **Anchor High:** By starting at $18,000, you set a high anchor point for Bob.  Even if he doesn't accept this price, his counteroffers might be higher than if you started lower.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how serious Bob is about the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
 
**Important:** Throughout the negotiation, keep John's offer in mind ($12,000). If Bob's offers are too low or the negotiation drags on, you always have the option to walk away and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $15,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below your initial ask. Bob's counter-offer indicates he's interested but trying to negotiate a better deal. There's room to negotiate further before accepting or resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?"", 
""product_price"": 16500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving down from your initial offer, you demonstrate willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  $16,500 keeps the price significantly above your minimum and closer to your initial offer. 
* **Test Bob's Limit:**  This counteroffer will help you understand how much further Bob is willing to go. If he rejects this, you can better gauge whether to push further or accept his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $15,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $15,500 is a solid profit above your minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's unlikely he'll move significantly higher than $15,500.  
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now secures a good deal without the risk of Bob walking away or further extended negotiations."
