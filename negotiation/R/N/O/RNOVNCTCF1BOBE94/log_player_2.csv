"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $200.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $140 for this. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly lowering her price, it's unlikely she'll go below $140.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $120, which is your maximum target price. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal and avoid potentially wasting more time negotiating with Alice."
