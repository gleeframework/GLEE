"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a good price and allowing me to make a solid profit.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go above that price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $925,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my means. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,6,
