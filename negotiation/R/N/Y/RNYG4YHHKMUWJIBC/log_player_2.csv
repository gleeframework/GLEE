"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $14,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get a great deal on a valuable product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's better than buying from John, but you can likely get a better deal. 
* **You have leverage.**  Since you have a backup option (John), you can try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price. 

By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're not desperate and are willing to walk away. This might encourage her to make a lower counteroffer to secure the sale."
