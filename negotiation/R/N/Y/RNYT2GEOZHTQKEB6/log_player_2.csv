"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $150.**  You're willing to pay no more than $150 for the product.
* **You have room to negotiate.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You can always go to John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.** You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is now offering the product for $110.
* **You've already saved $10.** You've successfully negotiated a lower price from Alice's initial offer of $120.
* **The risk of further negotiation is not worth it.** While you could try to get a lower price, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a further counteroffer. It's likely that you'll end up paying more or going to John."
