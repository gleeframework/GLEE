"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, as it aligns with my current value assessment. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the potential value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate at this price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1100000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside of my price range. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800000. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going any higher. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
