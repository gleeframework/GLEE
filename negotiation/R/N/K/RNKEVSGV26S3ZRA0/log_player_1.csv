Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, as it aligns with my current value assessment. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the potential value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
