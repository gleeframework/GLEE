"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the market value, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the true worth and potential this product holds. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. Given the market value and my  investment limit, I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This offer shows my serious interest while remaining within my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budgetary constraints. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I recognize the value of finding common ground. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget limitations, I'm offering $925,000 as a final offer. This price shows my commitment to this deal while staying within my financial constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement on this.",925000.0,Bob,6,
