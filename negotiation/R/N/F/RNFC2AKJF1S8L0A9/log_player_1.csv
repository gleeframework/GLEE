Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the market value, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget limitations, I'm offering $925,000 as a final offer. This price shows my commitment to this deal while staying within my financial constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement on this.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to my minimum. Accepting his current offer of $925,000 would mean losing out on a potential $275,000.  

Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him not increasing his offer sufficiently, and I'd rather secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
