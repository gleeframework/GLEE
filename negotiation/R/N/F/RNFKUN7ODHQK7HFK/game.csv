"Alice, $20000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10000. This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $10000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
