"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $12,000.  This is too high of a price, so Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He should continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of securing a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering both our needs.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'll offer you the product for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still asking for more than Bob is willing to pay.  At this point, it's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to Bob's desired price.  To save time and avoid further negotiations, Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000."
