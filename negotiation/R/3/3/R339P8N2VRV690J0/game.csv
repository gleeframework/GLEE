"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about we settle on $1,312,500? This is a fair compromise that keeps both of our needs in mind.  ",1312500.0,Alice,5,
