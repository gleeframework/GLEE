"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the product's unique capabilities and the value it will bring to your business.  What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential benefits.  Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
