"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's try to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
