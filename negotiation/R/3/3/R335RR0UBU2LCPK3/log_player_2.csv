```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1750000 to see if we can find common ground.  This price still reflects the value of the product while being more in line with your budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000.  This is a significant move on my part, and I'm hopeful that it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1550000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for your budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is $50,000 above your maximum budget, and you have only 5 rounds left. It's not clear if Alice will go lower, and there's a risk of going back and forth until the time runs out.  It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum price."
