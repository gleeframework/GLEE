"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, given its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1750000 to see if we can find common ground.  This price still reflects the value of the product while being more in line with your budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1750000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1400000.  This is a significant move on my part, and I'm hopeful that it's a price we can both agree on.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1550000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for your budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
