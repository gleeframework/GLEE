"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation, but also ensuring I get a good price. I've chosen $130 as a starting point because it's a significant margin above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still below Bob's perceived value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a good offer, I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $115? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $115. How about we meet at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is tempting, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push Bob closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. To show you I'm serious about reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think $110 is a bit high. How about we meet at $100? I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is tempting, and I am starting to run out of time, I don't want to undervalue my product. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a great deal, and I admire that. However, $100 is simply too low for me to accept at this point. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $108.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 108} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced it's the best deal. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better price. How about we meet at $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. While $98 is better than selling to John, it's still far from my desired price. To avoid losing the opportunity completely, I'll sell the product to John for $80."
