"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a good offer, I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $115? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $115. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. To show you I'm serious about reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll agree.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think $110 is a bit high. How about we meet at $100? I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a great deal, and I admire that. However, $100 is simply too low for me to accept at this point. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $108.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced it's the best deal. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better price. How about we meet at $98?",98.0,Bob,8,
