"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you consider $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9500.0,Alice,3,
