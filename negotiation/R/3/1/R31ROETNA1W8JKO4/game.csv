,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product like this, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This still gives you a good deal on a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $100. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",100.0,Bob,4,
