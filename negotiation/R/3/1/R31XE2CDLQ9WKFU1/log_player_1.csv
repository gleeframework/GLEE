{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. It's also a price that Bob may be willing to accept considering the product is worth $10,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your target price.  You're better off seeing if you can get closer to your target price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my minimum.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
