"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",250.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me, but $250 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $200. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $200 is still a bit more than I can afford. How about $175? I think it's a fair price that we can both be happy with.",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $190. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll find it a fair compromise.",190.0,Alice,5,
