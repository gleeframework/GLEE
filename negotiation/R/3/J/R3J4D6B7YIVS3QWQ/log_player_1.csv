"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and also signals the product's potential value to Bob. If he rejects, I can adjust the price in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is a significant amount, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm offering $1,400,000, which is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a price point I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can reach a price closer to $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1380000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,380,000. This is a small concession from my previous offer but still maintains a good price point. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,320,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to push for a slightly higher price. I want to see if Bob will budge further before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a compromise between Bob's last offer and my desired price, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,310,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the final few rounds, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not quite where I want it to be.  I'm concerned that if I continue negotiating, I might lose the opportunity to sell to John.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's still a significant amount of money, and it's better than potentially ending up with nothing."
