Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still being attractive to Bob as it's below his perceived value. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm confident I can still get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation,  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000? That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.  I'd rather not risk further negotiation that might lead to a rejection and a sale to John at the lower price."
