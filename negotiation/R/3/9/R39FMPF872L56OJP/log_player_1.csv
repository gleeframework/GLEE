Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,300,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer because $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
