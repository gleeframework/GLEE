"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than what Bob is willing to pay, there is still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get a better deal in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,300,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within his budget. This aggressive move aims to pressure Alice into accepting a lower price and potentially opening up further negotiations in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is still within Bob's budget and closer to his ideal price.  Since there are only 7 rounds left, it's a good idea to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a worse outcome or running out of time."
