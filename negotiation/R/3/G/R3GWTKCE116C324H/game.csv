Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, I believe there might be room for negotiation. Could we discuss a price closer to $10000? I'm very interested in acquiring the product, but I'm working within a specific budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussion.",13500.0,Alice,3,
