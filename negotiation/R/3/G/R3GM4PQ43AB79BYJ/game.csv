"Alice, thanks for the offer!  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to get the best possible deal.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $950,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  What do you say?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $925,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $935,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value it holds for you.
