"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price given your interest. Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the discount you've already offered.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  Given the value of this product to me and the fact that I'm already offering a discount, I can't go any lower than $850,000.  This still represents a significant saving for you compared to what others would charge.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your understanding, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can accept this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
