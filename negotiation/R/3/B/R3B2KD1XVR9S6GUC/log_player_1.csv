"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a price that's above your minimum but not so high that it immediately scares Bob away.  I'm aiming to get a good price, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to consider $12000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at my minimum, it's worth trying to push for a higher price. I'm going to counter with something closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $13,500?  That would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $13500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $13000? I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting very close to my ideal price. At this point, it's not worth risking losing the deal for another $500. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
