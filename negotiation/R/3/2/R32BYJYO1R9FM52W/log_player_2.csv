"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice, potentially saving even more money, before resorting to John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, though, and I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $13,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,750 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the product from John for $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice again to see if she'll come down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,750 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can sell the product to you for $13,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's final offer of $13,250 is still above Bob's budget, and he can get the product from John for $12,000.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice when he has a better deal available."
