"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $18,000 for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is quite a bit more than I had in mind. This product would be valuable to me at a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,16000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little on the price.  While $16,000 is closer to what I envisioned, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I feel that's a fair offer reflecting the product's value to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,14000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of the value this product can bring to your business and I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,,
