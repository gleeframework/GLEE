"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I think it's a great starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000, which is just $100,000 above my initial offer. I think this is a fair compromise that balances the value of the product with your budget constraints. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,200,000 is a good compromise. It's still a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000.  At this point, it's a good deal and worth accepting to avoid potentially going back and forth with Alice further or risking losing the product altogether."
