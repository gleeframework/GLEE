"Thanks for the offer Alice!  I really appreciate the chance to get this product, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $150 for it, which is what I'm comfortable spending. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $160 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend. I'm willing to go up to $155, which is the absolute maximum I can do. Let's see if we can close the deal.",155.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $155, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $157.50. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",157.5,Alice,5,
