Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Guarantee:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage. The goal is to see if you can get Bob to pay a price closer to his perceived value without going below your minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know you've expressed interest, and I believe it could be highly beneficial to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1600000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You start with a price above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Highlighting:** The message subtly reminds Bob of the product's benefits without revealing your hand.
* **Open to Discussion:** You end by inviting his thoughts, showing willingness to negotiate while not appearing desperate. 

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You get more than your minimum and John's offer.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to come down slightly while staying above your $1,500,000 floor. 
* **Bob Rejects:** You accept John's offer and meet your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. How Bob responds will determine your next move in the negotiation."
