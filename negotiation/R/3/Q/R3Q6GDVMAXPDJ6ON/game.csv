"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, the price point is a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential impact on your business. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,350,000? I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position on the product's value.  To be fair,  $1,100,000 may have been a bit low.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000 to reach a deal quickly.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your willingness to move on the price. It seems we're getting closer. To be fair to both of us, I can't go below $1,300,000. This is my final offer.  It represents a significant discount compared to the product's true value and potential.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
