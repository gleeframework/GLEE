Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential impact on your business. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,350,000? I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to move on the price. It seems we're getting closer. To be fair to both of us, I can't go below $1,300,000. This is my final offer.  It represents a significant discount compared to the product's true value and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is signaling a hard limit:** Her language (""final offer,"" ""significant discount"") suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **The price is within a reasonable range:**  $1,300,000 is only $100,000 above Alice's value and well below John's offer. 
* **Further negotiation might be risky:** Pushing Alice further could make her walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
