"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $82 is closer to what I'm hoping to spend, I'm still only comfortable paying $78.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer who's willing to pay more if you're not willing to accept this offer.",78.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $80. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us!",80.0,Alice,5,
