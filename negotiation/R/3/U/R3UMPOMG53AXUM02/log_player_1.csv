"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm starting with an offer of $15,000, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. My counteroffer for the product is $14000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I still have 9 rounds to negotiate, and I'm not desperate to sell. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to explore a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $14,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and I accept $14,500? This would still represent a good deal for you and would get us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me propose $14200 for the product. This still saves you some money compared to your original offer while being closer to what I'm comfortable paying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher amount. I'm willing to continue negotiating, and I have 6 rounds left. Selling to John for $10,000 is a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and accept $14,350.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it."", ""product_price"": 14350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to propose $14300 for the product. This keeps us moving forward while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,300 is very close to my desired price, and I'm confident that I won't get a significantly higher offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good deal with only four rounds remaining, minimizing the risk of a lower offer or having to sell to John for $10,000."
