"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'd like to propose a fair deal. Would you consider purchasing it for $95?",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we offer the product at $85 this time? This still allows us to cover our costs while being reasonable for you.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $85 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $82?",82.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let's try $83 as the price for the product. It's slightly above your proposed price but still quite reasonable considering the value we're offering.",83.0,Alice,5,
