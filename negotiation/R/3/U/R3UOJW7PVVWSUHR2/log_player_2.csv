"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'd like to propose a fair deal. Would you consider purchasing it for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Positive:** Even though I'm countering, I want to keep the tone positive and express continued interest in the product. 
* **Targeting Value:** My goal is to get the product as close to my perceived value ($100) as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we offer the product at $85 this time? This still allows us to cover our costs while being reasonable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my target price, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price slightly below her current offer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $85 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $82?"",
""product_price"": 82
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:**  I'm countering with a price that's only slightly lower than Alice's last offer, demonstrating that I'm serious about purchasing the product but still seeking the best deal.
* **Finding a Compromise:** My suggested price of $82 represents a compromise between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and potentially reach an agreement quickly. 
* **Time Consideration:** I'm conscious that we have a limited number of rounds, so I want to guide the negotiation toward a mutually acceptable price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let's try $83 as the price for the product. It's slightly above your proposed price but still quite reasonable considering the value we're offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down to $83, which is a good price and very close to my last counteroffer. 
* **Limited Time:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk the deal falling apart and having to pay $100 to John.
* **Strong Position:**  It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, especially since she countered my previous offer. Accepting now secures a good price."
