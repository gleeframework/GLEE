Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable, and I know it can benefit you greatly. I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's made available elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, aiming to persuade Bob.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning that the product will be available elsewhere creates a sense of urgency.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
