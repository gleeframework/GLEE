"I appreciate your research, Bob, but I've had other interested parties looking at the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm now offering the product to you for $1350000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on your final offer. I've found a better deal with another seller, and I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me there.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
