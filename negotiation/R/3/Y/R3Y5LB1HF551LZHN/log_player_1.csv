{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000, but I'm also willing to negotiate.  By starting at $14,000, I'm showing Bob that I'm open to compromise while still leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 
I'm offering $13,500 as a counteroffer.  This is a compromise from my initial price, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I would have liked to get a bit more from Bob,  it seems we're at an impasse. I've made a good effort to negotiate, and John is offering a fair price that meets my minimum. I don't want to risk losing a good deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
