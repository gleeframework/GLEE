"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. This is still a significant discount from the product's true value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a sweet spot at $1200000. This is already a significant discount from the market value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
