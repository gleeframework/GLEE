"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be extremely beneficial to your operations. Based on its potential value to you, I'm setting the price at $950,000. This is a significant discount from the true value it holds for you, and I'm confident it represents a very strong investment.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $950,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price or stick with buying from John at your maximum budget."
