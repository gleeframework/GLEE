"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This price is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a profit beyond my minimum of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $110. This demonstrates flexibility and could encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $105 is a reasonable compromise.  It's still a profit for me and avoids risking further negotiation rounds where I might end up with a worse deal."
