"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's exceptional quality and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no immediate benefit to accepting, as you can get the same product from John for the same price.  By rejecting the offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or finding a better deal elsewhere."
