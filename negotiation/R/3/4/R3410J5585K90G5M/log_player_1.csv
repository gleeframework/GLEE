Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I know Bob values the product at $100, I want to start with a higher offer to see if there's room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering it at $150 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer or for me to come down slightly in price while still making a significant profit.
* **Justification:** I've included a brief justification for the price, highlighting ""value,"" which might make Bob more receptive. 

**Important Note:** I know I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, but aiming higher with Bob could lead to a better outcome. I can always lower the price later if needed."
