"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $700000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $750000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for both of us to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach an agreement, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $765000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",765000.0,Alice,5,
