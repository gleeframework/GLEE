"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? That would be a fair price for both of us and a great deal for me.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
