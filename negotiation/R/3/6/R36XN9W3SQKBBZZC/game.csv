"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still well above your stated value. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, given the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers and offer $775,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775,000. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm willing to accept.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $875,000.  It's closer, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's split the difference again and go with $825,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our positions and allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $825,000. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm willing to accept.",900000.0,Alice,7,
