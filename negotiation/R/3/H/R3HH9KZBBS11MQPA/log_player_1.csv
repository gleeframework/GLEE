{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $10,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and conveys confidence in the product's value. It also encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Maximize your profit:** $10,000 is closer to your desired value than Bob's perceived value.
* **Start the negotiation:** It gives Bob an incentive to counter-offer, allowing for further negotiation and potentially a higher final price.
* **Provide a fallback option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John for $12,000, guaranteeing your minimum desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my desired minimum of $12,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my negotiating position:**  It shows Bob I'm not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Explore higher offers:** It opens the door for further negotiation and potentially a more favorable price.
* **Use John as leverage:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me a strong bargaining chip in future negotiations."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** This counteroffer is in the middle of my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). It shows I'm willing to compromise but still aim for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and highlights the value of the product. It also emphasizes a ""fair"" price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 

**Strategy:**

* **Progress towards a deal:** This counteroffer shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating and willing to move closer to his offer.
* **Maximize profit:** It keeps the price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 provides a strong bargaining position in case Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  Selling for $8,750 would be a significant financial loss. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:** It demonstrates my commitment to a higher price, making John's offer more attractive.
* **Continue negotiation:**  It opens the door for one more counteroffer before I'm forced to decide between Bob and John.
* **Maximize profit potential:**  I can potentially reach a higher price with another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,750 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway *one more time*.  Let's go with $9,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $9,000 is a compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer ($9,250) and Bob's offer ($8,750). It shows I'm willing to meet in the middle.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to accept. It also highlights the fairness of the compromise.

**Strategy:**

* **Final offer:**  This counteroffer positions the negotiation for a possible closing.
* **Maximizing profit:**  While not ideal, $9,000 is still significantly closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Leveraging the ultimatum:**  By stating it's my final offer, I create a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Bob to accept to avoid losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $8,800. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but I really need to stay within this range. Can you consider this one last offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already made significant concessions and am unlikely to get a better deal from Bob.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $12,000. This is the most financially secure option, as it avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price. 

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would consume time and potentially lead to a lower price.  Selling to John ensures a quick and profitable transaction.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  John's offer guarantees my desired profit, minimizing financial risk.
* **Avoiding deadlock:**  Further negotiation with Bob could lead to a deadlock, where neither of us is willing to compromise. Selling to John avoids this scenario."
