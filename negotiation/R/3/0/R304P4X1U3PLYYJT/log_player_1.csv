Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency. This might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a price closer to your initial offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While we start high, the offer isn't ridiculously above Bob's perceived value. There's room for him to negotiate down, potentially landing somewhere above your $10,000 minimum."
