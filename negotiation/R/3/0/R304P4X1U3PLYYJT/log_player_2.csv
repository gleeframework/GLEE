"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  Let's see if we can get a better deal.
