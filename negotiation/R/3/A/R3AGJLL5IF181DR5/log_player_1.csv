Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $5,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm still hopeful I can negotiate a better price with Bob, so I'll reject his offer for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle?  I'll offer you the product for $9,000.  This would still allow me to make a decent profit, and hopefully, it's within your range.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for my budget.  How about we settle on $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $15,000, I'm still not comfortable selling it that low.  I want to try and get a bit closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  $7,000 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is a really good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
