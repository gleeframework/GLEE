{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle?  I'll offer you the product for $9,000.  This would still allow me to make a decent profit, and hopefully, it's within your range.  Let's see if we can close this deal!

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for my budget.  How about we settle on $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  $7,000 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is a really good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?
