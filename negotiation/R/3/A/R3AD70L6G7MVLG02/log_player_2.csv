Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still quite low for the value this product provides.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and see you're trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,350,000 doesn't reflect the value this product offers you. It's crucial for both of us to benefit from this deal.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,375,000. This is my final offer. It's a fair price considering your interest in the product and its potential to grow your business. If you're serious about acquiring it, let's close this agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,375,000 is still slightly above my budget.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I don't want to risk the deal falling through.  John offers the product at my maximum budget, so it's the safest and most financially sound option."
