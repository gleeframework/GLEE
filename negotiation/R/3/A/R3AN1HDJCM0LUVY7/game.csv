"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product to you, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
