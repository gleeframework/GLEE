"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $2,250,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is my maximum price point.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand your position, but $2,250,000 represents a significant discount on the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm serious about this product, but I can't go higher than $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
