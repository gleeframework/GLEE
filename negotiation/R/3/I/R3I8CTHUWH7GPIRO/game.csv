"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price of $1,000,000.  Let's split the difference and I'll accept $950,000.  This would give you a good deal, and it would allow me to get closer to my goal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
