"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that will bring you immense value. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still above your desired price range. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, but I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price somewhere in between."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway at $11,000, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my price range, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $10,500. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm ready to close the deal at the right price."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered the price to $11,250. While it's still higher than my ideal price of $10,500, it's getting closer. It's also a significant discount from the initial offer of $12,000.  If I keep rejecting, I risk Alice becoming less willing to negotiate. At this point, it makes more financial sense to accept the offer, especially considering John's price of $15,000."
