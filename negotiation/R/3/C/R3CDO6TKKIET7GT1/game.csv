"I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that will bring you immense value. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, but I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price somewhere in between.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway at $11,000, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $10,500. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm ready to close the deal at the right price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
