"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm hoping we can agree on a price that's a bit more manageable for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to come in at $1,050,000.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000.

This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your hard limit, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,070,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,040,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1040000.0,Alice,7,
