"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $85. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me and leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, it's getting close to the end of the rounds and I'm not confident I can get a better price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  This ensures I meet my minimum profit goal and avoids further risk of losing money."
