"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120 but still above her value of $80. This gives Alice room to bargain while still allowing me to save a considerable amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still too high. I'm willing to pay more than my initial counteroffer of $100, but I can likely still get a better price by counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $110, which is still lower than Alice's latest offer of $130 but closer to a price we might both agree on. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is getting closer to my maximum budget, but I still have some room to negotiate. It's more advantageous to continue negotiating with Alice than to immediately buy from John at $150. There's a chance I can secure a better deal with Alice in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is getting close to my maximum budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm increasing my offer to $120, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this offer has a good chance of being accepted by Alice, as it's still above her value of $80. This would allow me to secure the product without having to resort to buying it from John for $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $145 is just $5 below John's price of $150, and we are already in round 7, leaving only 3 rounds left.  Considering Alice's stubbornness in negotiation, there's a high chance she won't budge significantly in the remaining rounds.  It's more efficient to buy from John and save time."
