,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $110? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $112. I think this is a fair price, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",112.0,Alice,5,
