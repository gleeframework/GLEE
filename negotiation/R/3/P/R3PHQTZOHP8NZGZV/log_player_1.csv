Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Value:** You value the product at a minimum of $12,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000. 

By offering $14,000, you are:

* **Maximizing your profit:** You earn $2,000 more than your minimum value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Bob still has a $1,000 ""profit"" in buying from you compared to his alternative of not buying. This makes the offer attractive for him.

If Bob rejects the offer, you can confidently move on to selling the product to John for $12,000, ensuring you still meet your minimum goal."
