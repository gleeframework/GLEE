Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a profit for Alice.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000, ensuring she doesn't lose money. 

By setting the price high but below Bob's maximum, Alice increases her chances of a profitable sale while having a safety net with John."
