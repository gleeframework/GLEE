"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
