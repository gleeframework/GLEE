"Bob, I understand your position.  While $750,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $800,000?  This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any higher.",800000.0,Bob,4,
