Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 (to John) gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price. 

This strategy aims for a win-win: a great deal for Bob and maximum profit for you."
