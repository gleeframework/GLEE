"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $11,000 is still below my minimum, and I believe I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is tempting, I'm looking for a price closer to $12,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  Would you be willing to go to $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd be willing to pay $11250. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $11,250 is a decent compromise and above my minimum.  It's better than selling to John and gives me some room to potentially negotiate with other buyers in the future."
