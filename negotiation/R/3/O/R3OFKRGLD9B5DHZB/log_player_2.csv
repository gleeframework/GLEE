Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get the price down to $750,000, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that.

Alice has reached her minimum price, and there's no point in negotiating further.  Getting the product for $800,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,200,000 price."
