"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but $700,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $750,000.  Would that be workable for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get the price down to $750,000, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that.",800000.0,Alice,5,
