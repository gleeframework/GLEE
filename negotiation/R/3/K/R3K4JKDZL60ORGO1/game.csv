"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",825000.0,Alice,5,
