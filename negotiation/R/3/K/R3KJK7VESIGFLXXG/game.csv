"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Let me know what you think!",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can still make a good profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $7,800, which is as high as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",7800.0,Bob,4,
