Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation while also ensuring I get a decent return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your generosity, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'll reject his offer and counter-propose in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm not ready to accept $8,000. It's simply too low for me at this point. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000.  That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer at $8,500. This price reflects the value I see in the product while keeping my budget in mind. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but I'm getting closer to my goal and we're running out of rounds.  I'll accept his offer."
