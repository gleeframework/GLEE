Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, making it likely he'll consider it.
* **It signals confidence:**  Starting high shows you believe in the product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below what you want to earn.  You can likely squeeze a bit more out of him.  Let's see if you can get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000, which would be $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise. It's closer to your desired price than John's offer of $8,000, and it's likely you won't be able to squeeze much more out of Bob.  It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
