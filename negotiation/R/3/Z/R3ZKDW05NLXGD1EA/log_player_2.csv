"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's negotiate to try and get a lower price.  Alice is starting quite high above her value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's counter again and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $115 is closer but I was hoping to keep it under $110. How about $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

We're nudging towards a price that works for us while still signaling to Alice that we're serious about buying."
