Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Starting at $100 gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Open to negotiation:**  Saying I'm ""open to negotiating"" shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage.
* **John as backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **John is a better option:** I can sell to John for $80, which is more than Bob's offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm not completely closing the door.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you're interested.  $75 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Close to my minimum:** $85 is only $5 above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $80 if Bob rejects my offer."
