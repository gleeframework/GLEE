# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within his budget, he can potentially get the product for even cheaper. By rejecting Alice's offer, he can start a counteroffer process and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for Bob. It is still within his budget and closer to his desired price than his initial counteroffer. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject again or even increase the price. It's more beneficial for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
