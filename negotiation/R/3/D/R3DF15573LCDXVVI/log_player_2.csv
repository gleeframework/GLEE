"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. I think it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $90
* **John's price:** $100 

Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will cost you $100, but rejecting Alice's offer and waiting for a counter-offer or negotiating a lower price with Alice might allow you to get the product for less than $90."
