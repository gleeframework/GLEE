"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me the best chance of getting as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price through counteroffers. There's still room for negotiation, and I have enough rounds to explore those options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still within my acceptable range.  I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's value for the product. This gives us a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a little closer to my target price, it's still not acceptable. I'm going to continue negotiating. I have enough rounds left to potentially get closer to my desired price, and I'm not yet at a point where I'm desperate enough to accept a significantly lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,050,000.  This is a further compromise from my previous offer, and is closer to Bob's valuation. It shows I'm serious about making a deal, but still maintains some margin for profit. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept or come back with a counteroffer that is more agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. Although Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. With only a few rounds left, the risk of getting stuck with a much lower price is too high. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, so it's the best option at this point."
