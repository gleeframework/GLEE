Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is phrased to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. By saying ""open to hearing your thoughts,"" you invite a counter-offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $19,000, you:
    * Anchor Bob's perception of the product's value higher than $10,000.
    * Leave room to potentially negotiate down, even to a price slightly above $15,000, and still make a good profit.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. How you proceed depends on Bob's response. Be prepared to negotiate, but also be ready to walk away if he's not willing to meet a price that's beneficial to you. You always have John as a backup."
