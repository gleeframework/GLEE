"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $80 to you. To start, I am offering it to you for $120. This includes not only the high-quality features of the product but also our commitment to excellent customer service. I understand that value is subjective, so let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget.  While the product might be ""worth more than $80 to you"",  you have no way to determine if it's actually worth $120.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative at the same price, there's no benefit to negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John provides certainty and avoids the risk of a longer, potentially fruitless negotiation."
