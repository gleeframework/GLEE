"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal quickly.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fantastic deal for a product you'll truly benefit from.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to split the difference and offer $10,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. Let's get this deal done.",10000.0,Bob,4,
