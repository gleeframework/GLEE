"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and while it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $15,800. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum and it's worth taking the deal rather than risking a lower offer or potentially selling to John for a lower price."
