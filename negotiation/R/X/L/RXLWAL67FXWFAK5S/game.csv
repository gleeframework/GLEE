"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
