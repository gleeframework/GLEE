"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $18,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, so it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $17,000 to be comfortable. How about we try $16,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit and me to get a great deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,500, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob is getting close to his budget, but Alice's offer of $16,000 is still too high. It's now time to cut his losses and buy from John for $15,000, which is within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
