"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $17,000 to be comfortable. How about we try $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit and me to get a great deal.  Let's make this happen.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,500, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
