Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

Since I am Alice, and I know John is willing to pay $1,500,000, I will offer Bob the same price. This maximizes my chances of getting the highest possible price for the product. While Bob will likely reject the offer, knowing he can purchase it for $1,000,000 elsewhere, I will still be able to sell the product to John for my desired price."
