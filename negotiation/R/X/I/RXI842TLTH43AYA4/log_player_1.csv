{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's lower than my minimum value:** This makes the deal attractive to Bob and increases the likelihood of a sale.
* **It shows I'm willing to negotiate:** This builds rapport and opens the door for a potential counteroffer from Bob. 

By starting with a slightly lower price, I can potentially reach a deal that is mutually beneficial while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept an offer that doesn't meet my minimum. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can make a decent profit while still giving you a great deal on a quality product."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $125 for the product? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $125 is still below my minimum value of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept an offer that doesn't meet my minimum requirements. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum, I'll take the sure thing and sell to him."
