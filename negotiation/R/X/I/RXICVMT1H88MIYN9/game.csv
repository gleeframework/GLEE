"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its worth $800,000 to you, and it's still a significant profit for me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good profit, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer. However, I'm still not ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
