Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm confident that you'll find this price reasonable, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I've done some research and I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I've made a significant concession by moving from $1,200,000 to $900,000 and then to $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll go below John's $800,000 offer.  It's better to secure the product now at the best known price than risk Alice not going low enough."
