"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a lower price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could potentially go up to $700,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $700,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
