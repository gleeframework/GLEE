Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
