"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,700,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,675,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $1,675,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000 is too high, I'd be willing to go up to $1,625,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,625,000?",1625000.0,Bob,6,
