{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so this price leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You're aiming for $1,500,000, so there's still potential to gain more. 
* **It's a clear signal:** You're confident in the value of your product and are willing to negotiate fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. Can you meet me at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price for Bob, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would be a substantial loss.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground.  If not, selling to John guarantees my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover my costs for this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the unique nature of the product to justify the price and make it clear that I'm not simply willing to accept anything.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price still gives me some room to negotiate if Bob needs to come down further, but it's closer to my target price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,275,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal. Can you consider that offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is coming closer to my desired price, $1,275,000 is still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm not yet willing to sell at such a substantial loss. I believe I can still push for a higher price with another counteroffer.  If Bob doesn't budge, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,275,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to move forward with the transaction.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both agree on.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is a final attempt to meet Bob halfway while still protecting my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price and reinforce the benefits for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

If Bob rejects this final offer, I will accept John's offer for $1,500,000 to ensure I receive my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. Can you meet me at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I appreciate Bob's persistence and willingness to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at such a substantial loss.  I've already made significant compromises and reached my limit.  

Selling to John guarantees my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob. It's the most financially advantageous decision at this point."
