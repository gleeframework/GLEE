"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000 for the product.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the following rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives me a reasonable return while being a significant discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I need to hold out for a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and counter again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $875,000?
