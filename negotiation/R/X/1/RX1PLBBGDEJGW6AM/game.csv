"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is reasonable, the value of this product to the right buyer is considerably higher.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,900,000 remains outside of my budget.  I'm confident that $1,500,000 is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while allowing you to still make a substantial profit. Let's find common ground at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
