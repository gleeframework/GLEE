"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** We start significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This provides substantial room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value while inviting Bob's input.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By aiming high initially, we set a strong anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this offer, it sets a higher reference point for subsequent counteroffers.

This strategy allows for flexibility while maximizing the potential profit. We can always come down in price during subsequent rounds if necessary, but starting high gives us the best chance to secure a favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he has moved up from his initial perceived value, we have room to negotiate before considering selling to John. We'll aim to bring him closer to our range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is reasonable, the value of this product to the right buyer is considerably higher.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We are making a substantial concession from our initial offer, signaling to Bob that we are open to negotiation. However, the decrease is calculated - it brings us closer to a potential agreement without dropping below our acceptable range.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the product's value proposition, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits and justifying the price point.
* **Pressure Point:** By staying significantly above his offer, we maintain pressure on Bob to make a meaningful move towards our target price.  

This counteroffer aims to encourage a counter from Bob while keeping the negotiation moving in a positive direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,900,000 remains outside of my budget.  I'm confident that $1,500,000 is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while allowing you to still make a substantial profit. Let's find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob would be willing to go higher. Accepting now secures the sale at our desired profit margin."
