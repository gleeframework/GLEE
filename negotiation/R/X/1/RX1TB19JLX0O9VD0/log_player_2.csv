{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $95. This is a good deal, but I can likely get it for a lower price. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is a fair compromise. While I'd still prefer to pay less, I'm happy to accept this offer as it's within my budget and saves me $10 compared to buying from John."
