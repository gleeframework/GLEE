"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",10200.0,Alice,5,
