This offer starts high, but allows for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, potentially piquing his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest! While I'm open to negotiating, $75 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $112.50?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 112.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can meet you at $112.50, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $75. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a bit higher with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $100? That's still a great price for the product, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $92? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum, I've already been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob.  It's taking too long, and I'm running the risk of him walking away completely.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
