Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm offering it at $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price reflecting its worth. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also need to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000, so our offer needs to be significantly below his valuation to entice him.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, ensuring we don't lose money if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $14,000, we're:

1. **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, but we're still starting from a strong position.
2. **Creating urgency:**  The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing implies that the offer might not last forever, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
3. **Highlighting value:** We emphasize the ""unique value"" to justify the price without revealing our bottom line."
