"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm offering it at $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price reflecting its worth. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly below her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
