Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring I get a price significantly above my minimum ($100). 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100, so I won't go below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is above my minimum, it's closer to my bottom line than Bob's perceived value. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and gives me a chance to steer the price higher. I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price of $110, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Justification:**  Framing it as ""meeting halfway"" makes the offer seem more reasonable and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my desired range.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm still conscious of John's offer of $100, which serves as my ""walk-away"" point if Bob doesn't budge significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has stood firm at $105, and it's unlikely he'll go much higher. While it's not the $110 I was hoping for, it's still a $5 profit over selling to John. It's better to secure a reasonable profit now than risk Bob walking away altogether."
