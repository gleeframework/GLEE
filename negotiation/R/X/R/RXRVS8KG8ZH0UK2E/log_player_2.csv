"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget and significantly higher than what John is offering. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product but could only consider a price closer to $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than Alice's initial price ($12,000) and even lower than our maximum budget ($8,000). This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Gauge Reaction:**  This counteroffer will help us understand Alice's flexibility and how low she might be willing to go. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, we always have John's offer of $8,000 as a backup plan if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down in price, but $9,000 is still above your target price and what John is offering.  You'll need to counter again, but you can nudge a bit closer to her price to show willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? I feel that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to Alice's price by increasing our offer to $7,000.  This shows we're willing to compromise.
* **Staying Below John's Price:** Our offer is still below John's $8,000 price, so we have room to go up if needed. 
* **Direct and Reasonable:**  Our message is straightforward and explains our position, aiming for a reasonable and mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,200. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting close, but she's still above John's price. Let's see if we can get her to budge just a bit more.  There's no guarantee she'll go lower, but it's worth one more try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,200 is very close, but I need to stay within my strict budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,100?"",
""product_price"": 8100
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Final Push:**  We're making a small increase to $8,100, aiming for that sweet spot between our budget and Alice's lowest apparent price.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating it's our ""strict budget,"" we're implying this might be our final offer.
* **Compromise:** ""Meet in the middle"" suggests a fair resolution where both sides concede slightly. 

**Important Note:** If Alice rejects this offer, it's highly likely we'll need to go with John's offer in the next round. The difference at this point is very small, and Alice may not be willing to go any lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,150. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go any lower. She's signaled this is her final offer, and it's still above John's price.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
