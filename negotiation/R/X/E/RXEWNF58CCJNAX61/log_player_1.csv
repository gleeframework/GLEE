Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $925,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $875,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.
