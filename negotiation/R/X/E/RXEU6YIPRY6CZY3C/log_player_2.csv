Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $17,000, which is the lowest I can go for now.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $16,000, which is the best I can do for now.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $16,000, and at this point, John's offer of $15,000 is a better deal. It's time to cut negotiations short and secure the product at a reasonable price."
