"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000. I'll start by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits of the product.  I hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $950,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate further. There's still room for us to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $950,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $980,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  At this point, I'm getting close to my limit and the risk of going further is too high.  I'm better off buying the product from John for $800,000 to ensure I stay within my budget."
