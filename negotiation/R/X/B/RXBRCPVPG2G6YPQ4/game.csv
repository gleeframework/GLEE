"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits of the product.  I hope we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $950,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $980,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",980000.0,Alice,5,
