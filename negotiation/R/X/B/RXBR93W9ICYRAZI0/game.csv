"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I'm willing to consider a price of $975,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price, considering we're both eager to close this deal. If we can't find common ground at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
