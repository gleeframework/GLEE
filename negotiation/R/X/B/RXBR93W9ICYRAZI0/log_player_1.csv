Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price, considering we're both eager to close this deal. If we can't find common ground at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While it's less than I hoped for, getting $950,000 is a reasonable outcome. Bob is clearly unwilling to budge further, and continuing the negotiation risks losing him entirely. Accepting this offer ensures a good return without risking a deal with John."
