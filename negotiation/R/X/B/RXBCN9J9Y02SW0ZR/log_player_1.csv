"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more reasonable offer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still far too low for me. I need to stay above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution, but $950,000 is still too far below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This represents a significant reduction from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that low.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
