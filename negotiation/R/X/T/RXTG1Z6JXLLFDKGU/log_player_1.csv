Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your limits:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, so you shouldn't accept anything less than that.
* **Maximize profit:**  While you could offer it to Bob for $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate a higher price. Bob values the product at $1,000,000, leaving a potential $200,000 surplus.
* **Strategic pricing:** By offering the product at $1,150,000:
    * You are aiming for a significant portion of that surplus.
    * You give Bob a compelling reason to buy now, saving $50,000 compared to your guaranteed sale price.
    * The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
