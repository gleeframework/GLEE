Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,500. Let's see if we can make a deal!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise at $7,500, but I'll throw in a small concession - I'll include a premium service package worth $500. So, the total price would be $8,000, but I'll give you the service package for free. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging below $8,000 even with the added ""free"" service. This service doesn't change the fact that you can buy the product outright for $8,000 from John. There's no benefit to continuing negotiation with Alice."
