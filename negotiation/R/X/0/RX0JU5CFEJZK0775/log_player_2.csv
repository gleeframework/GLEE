**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $120, but her offer is $110.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **It's early in the game.** You have 9 rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
