"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? This is a fair compromise given the product's value to you. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a little out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,750.  This seems like a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,750 is still a little below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $10,000 for a final compromise. This is a great deal for both of us - I'm getting closer to my desired price, and you're getting a valuable product at a very fair price.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
