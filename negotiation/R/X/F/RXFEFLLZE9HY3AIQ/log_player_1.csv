"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$9,500 is still a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price, but I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? This is a fair compromise given the product's value to you. "", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a little out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,750.  This seems like a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,750 is still a little below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $10,000 for a final compromise. This is a great deal for both of us - I'm getting closer to my desired price, and you're getting a valuable product at a very fair price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
