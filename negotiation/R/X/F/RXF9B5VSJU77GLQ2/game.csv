"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price.  I'm proposing $1,100,000.  This represents a significant discount from my original offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. I'm proposing $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
