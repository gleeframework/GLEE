Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to be confident but not too aggressive in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $8,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm still trying to get a good price but I'm showing some flexibility.  I've lowered my price by $1,500, but still above my minimum, making it a reasonable counteroffer."

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,750 is still a bit below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125?  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

I'm still trying to get closer to my desired price point, but I'm also showing that I'm willing to be flexible. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise without completely giving in to Bob's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we need to find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to go up to $9,900. That's a significant move on my part, and I hope you can see I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal, but if this doesn't work, I'll sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,900 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider selling to someone else. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm making my final offer, which is still above my minimum value of $8,000. I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
