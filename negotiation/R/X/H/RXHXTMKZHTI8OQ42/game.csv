"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $107.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer for the product at this price.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $107.50 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  How about we split the difference one last time at $108.75? This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to finalize the transaction. What do you say?",108.75,Alice,5,
