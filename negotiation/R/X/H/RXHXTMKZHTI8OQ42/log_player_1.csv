{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation if Bob rejects it. I'm also being friendly and encouraging to try and build a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. "", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $107.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer for the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $107.5 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $107.50 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  How about we split the difference one last time at $108.75?
