"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,3,
