Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be extremely valuable to you. My asking price is $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is below the product's value to Bob but still leaves me with a significant profit.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm using positive language to create a good rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by not setting a hardline stance. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a great deal. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping in mind John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,200,000 is still a profit for me, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and much closer to John's offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially since he acknowledges the value of the product.
* **Strategic advantage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my original offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. I need to be careful not to go too low, as I don't want to end up selling to John at a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,200,000). 
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive and encouraging language to keep Bob engaged and motivated to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still not giving up on getting a better price. This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm serious about selling to Bob but also that I'm not desperate to close the deal at any cost. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the situation and decide whether to make a further counteroffer or take John's offer.  I'll need to weigh the potential for a higher price from Bob against the risk of losing the deal entirely."
