"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's too risky to accept.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a very low counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strategy to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially establish a lower starting point for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly above Bob's budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to lower the price further. There are still 7 rounds left, and buying from John at this point would be too expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, but still keeping it below his maximum budget. This is a tactic to show he's serious about buying the product, but also to push for a price closer to his desired range.  He's getting closer to the potential deal with John, but there's still room for negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and he's getting closer to the deal with John. He needs to keep pushing for a lower price and see if he can get Alice closer to his ideal range. With five rounds remaining, there's still a chance to secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a price very close to his maximum budget.  He is making a serious offer to see if Alice is willing to meet him halfway.  There's a possibility that with only 4 rounds left, Alice will want to close the deal rather than risk losing the sale completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and even though he's getting closer to the deal with John,  he needs to keep pushing for a lower price. He's now approaching the risk zone of  potentially missing out on a deal with Alice.  There are still 3 rounds left, and Bob might be able to squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum budget of $10,000. This is a bold move, as it's a ""take it or leave it"" offer.  With only two rounds left, Bob is showing Alice that he's serious about getting this product at his desired price. It's a gamble, but it's a risk he's willing to take."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough situation for Bob. Alice's offer is still significantly above Bob's maximum budget, and there's only one round left. If he rejects the offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down to his price point.  

Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for his maximum budget, ensuring a deal and avoiding the risk of ending up with nothing in the last round.  It's a strategic decision to avoid potential disappointment and ensure he gets the product he wants, even if it means paying the higher price."
