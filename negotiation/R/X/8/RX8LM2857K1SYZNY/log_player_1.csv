Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a one-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $15,000, aiming for a price slightly below that ($14,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Avoid Leaving Money on the Table:**  Offering it for $10,000 (its value to you) risks missing out on potential profit.
* **Urgency and Clarity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency (""one-time offer"") and clearly states the value proposition.

**This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the sale with Bob at a profitable price and the fallback option of selling to John at your minimum acceptable price.**"
