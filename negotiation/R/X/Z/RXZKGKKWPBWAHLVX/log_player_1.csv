Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price above my minimum. 
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward, indicating the product and the offered price."
