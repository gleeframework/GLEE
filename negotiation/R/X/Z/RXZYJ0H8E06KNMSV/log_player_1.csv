**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to budge beyond his valuation.  While I could continue negotiating, it's highly unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I get a fair price and avoids further time spent on negotiations that are unlikely to yield a better outcome."
