"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the significant value I'm offering.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does staying within my budget. I can go as high as $950,000, but that's really my limit. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is still below my ideal price, I recognize your budget constraints. To reach a compromise, I'm willing to accept $1,650,000.  This offer reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands while still acknowledging its true value.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement you've made so far.  Let's be realistic though,  $1,650,000 is still a significant gap from what I'm willing to spend.  My best and final offer is $1,000,000. I think that's a fair deal considering you can always try to find another buyer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
