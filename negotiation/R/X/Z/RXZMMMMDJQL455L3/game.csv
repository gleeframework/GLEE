"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider  $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep, but $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I've thought it over, and I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can do $850,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,5,
