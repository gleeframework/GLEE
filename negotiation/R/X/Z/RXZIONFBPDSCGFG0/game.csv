"Hi Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can close the deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This still leaves a good profit margin for me, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875000. This reflects a good compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away with a fair deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",875000.0,Bob,4,
