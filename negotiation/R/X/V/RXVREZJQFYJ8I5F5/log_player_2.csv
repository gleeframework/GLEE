"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $10,000 is above your budget and you have room to negotiate.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  I'm sure we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $8500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9500.  I believe this product is worth that much to you.  Let's find a compromise we're both happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still too high.  $9,500 is too close to your limit.  You can try to get a lower price from Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still too steep for me. I'm willing to go to $9,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 9000}
