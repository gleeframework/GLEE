Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8500?  I'm sure we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. He's already shown interest, so I'm willing to continue negotiating for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,500.  I believe this product is worth that much to you.  Let's find a compromise we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9500 is still too steep for me. I'm willing to go to $9000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price of $9,500, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a significantly better offer from him. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a good profit. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $8,000."
