"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8500?  I'm sure we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $8500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9500.  I believe this product is worth that much to you.  Let's find a compromise we're both happy with.",9500.0,Alice,3,
