"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $14,000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a lower price, but he's still showing interest. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still higher than Alice's minimum.  It's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To better align with your budget, we're proposing a revised price of $13,500 for the item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going, allowing Bob to try to secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,500. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by meeting Alice halfway.  $13,000 is still within his budget and a reasonable compromise, making it likely Alice will accept."
