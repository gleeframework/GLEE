{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a good starting point, leaving some room for negotiation, but still well above my minimum acceptable value.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $140 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering $145.  It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, it's attractive enough for him to accept, but still gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $142 is very close to my counteroffer and significantly better than selling to John.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
