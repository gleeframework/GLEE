"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,500. This still leaves some room for profit, but also gives you a great deal. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that work for you?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
