"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are only willing to pay up to $8,000, this is your initial counteroffer. It's a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and shows Alice your firm budget.  If Alice rejects, you can reassess and potentially make a slightly higher offer, but still aiming for a price closer to your limit."
