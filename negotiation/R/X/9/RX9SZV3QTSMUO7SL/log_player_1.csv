I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for potential negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if needed, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price of $13,500. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still fair, considering my minimum price and Bob's counteroffer. I hope he will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,500. While it's not my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John for $12,000.  I'm confident that I've gotten the best possible price from Bob considering his previous offers and the risk of him continuing to negotiate down."
