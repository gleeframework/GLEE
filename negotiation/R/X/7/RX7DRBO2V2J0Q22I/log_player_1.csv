"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and allows me to see if Bob is truly interested in the product. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter-offer, keeping in mind the value of the product to me and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I want to close the deal, accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I still have 8 rounds to negotiate and can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum value of $1,500,000 but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and we can move towards an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I have 6 rounds left and can always sell to John for $1,500,000.  I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering $1,600,000 as a counteroffer.  This is a slightly lower price than my previous offer, showing that I am willing to compromise.  However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product and the remaining rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still $100,000 below. I have four rounds left and can always sell to John for $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit more.  I'll see if I can negotiate him up to $1,450,000 or even $1,500,000 before I resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to offer $1,450,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. It's also just above my minimum value, giving me a slight profit.  We have three rounds left, and if Bob doesn't accept, I'll have to decide whether to risk another round or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still $150,000 below my minimum. With only two rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating.  There's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. I'm going to take the secure option and sell to John."
