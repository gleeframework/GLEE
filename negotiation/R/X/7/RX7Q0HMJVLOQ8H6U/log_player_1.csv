"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get a profit above my minimum of $150.  I'm curious to see how Bob values the product and if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject this offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering with $175.  This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but shows I'm willing to be flexible.  It's also a significant jump from Bob's offer, showing that I value the product more highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob. There's still room for a better price, and I'm not desperate to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $160.  This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully this will encourage him to come up a bit on his offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is tempting, it's still a bit below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  I'm starting to run out of time, but I believe I can still get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $150. This is my absolute minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to it. We're both getting closer to a deal, and I don't want to risk losing him by pushing for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob is still refusing to budge.  I've already lowered my offer to my absolute minimum, and there's no guarantee he'll agree to my next counteroffer.  With only two rounds left, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's not ideal, but it's still a decent profit, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all from Bob."
