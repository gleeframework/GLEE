"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer of $650,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think there's room for negotiation. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your desire to negotiate further, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to meet you exactly in the middle at $750,000. I'm willing to sell the product for $800,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.
