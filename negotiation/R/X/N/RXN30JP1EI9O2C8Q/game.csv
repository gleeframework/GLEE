"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet this price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering both of our positions.",800000.0,Bob,4,
