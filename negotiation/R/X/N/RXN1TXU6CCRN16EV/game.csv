"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, though, and I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  While I appreciate your offer of $12,000, I need to get at least $14,000 out of this product.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
