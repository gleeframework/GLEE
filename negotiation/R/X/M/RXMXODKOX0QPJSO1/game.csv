"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob.  While I appreciate your offer,  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a good deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $105 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about $112?  That's only $7 more than your last offer, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $112, but I'm willing to meet you at $108. That's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product from you if you accept this price.",108.0,Bob,6,
