{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Not too high:**  I'm keeping it below my minimum acceptable price ($120) to avoid instantly ending the negotiation.
* **Friendly message:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  While Bob is clearly interested, there's room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him. 

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $100 to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're interested in the product, Bob.  While I appreciate your offer,  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm responding to Bob's offer with a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation moving.
* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering $110 is a compromise that's closer to my desired price, while also showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:** My message emphasizes a mutual benefit, making the counteroffer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $120 I'm willing to accept. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob seems interested. 
* **No urgency to sell:** I'm not under pressure to sell immediately, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John.

I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer to see if we can reach a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $105 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about $112?  That's only $7 more than your last offer, and it's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** I'm only asking for $7 more than Bob's offer, making it seem like a small difference and more likely to be accepted.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm highlighting that $112 is still a good deal for Bob, framing the offer as a win-win.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $112, but I'm willing to meet you at $108. That's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product from you if you accept this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:**  While $108 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **No time for further negotiation:**  I've already made several counteroffers, and the negotiation is taking longer than I anticipated.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $120, which is the best outcome given the current situation.

Selling to John is the most logical decision, as it ensures a profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
