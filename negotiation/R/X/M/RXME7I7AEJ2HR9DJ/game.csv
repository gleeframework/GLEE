"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $9500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to offer $8750, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8750 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8800. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
