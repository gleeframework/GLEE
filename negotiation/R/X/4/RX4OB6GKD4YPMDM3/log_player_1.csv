"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $650,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John would guarantee $800,000, but I want to see if I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit,  but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $750,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to make sure it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $750,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I still have 6 more rounds to negotiate.  I believe I can secure a better price, potentially even closer to my initial asking price.  Selling to John would guarantee $800,000, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations to try and get a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum. How about $725,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's still a great value for you considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 725000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, this product would be a great value.  I can tell we're close to an agreement. How about $710,000? That's a firm offer from me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $710,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $710,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $710,000 is a strong offer, I still have four rounds left.  I'm not yet satisfied with the price and believe I can push for a slightly higher amount.  Selling to John would guarantee $800,000, but I'm optimistic about securing a better price in the remaining rounds."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm close to my minimum price, and I'm willing to make a final concession.  How about $715,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would be a very good deal for you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 715000}
