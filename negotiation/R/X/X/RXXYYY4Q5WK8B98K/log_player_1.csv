Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $150. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly. 
* **Potential Profit:**  While Bob values the product at $120, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives it as valuable. A $150 offer allows for a potential $30 profit.
* **Fallback Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob counters, be prepared to negotiate."
