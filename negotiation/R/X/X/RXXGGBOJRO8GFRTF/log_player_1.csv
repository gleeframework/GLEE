Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500** is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* This strategy allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still securing a profit for me. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing flexibility by lowering my price.
* $11,000 is still a good profit for me, but it's a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
*  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, and I am serious about buying it.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is only $250 less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,500.  Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000,  accepting Bob's offer is the best option. It secures a slightly higher profit than selling to John while minimizing further negotiation and potential risks."
