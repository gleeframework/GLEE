Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate, but still allows you to make a profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This keeps the negotiation open and avoids you immediately resorting to selling to John. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me a chance to counter with a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
I've lowered my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer.  I believe $95 is a fair compromise that gives both of us a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $95 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? That's the lowest I can go, but I really like the product and would like to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $85 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to get.  At this point, I'm better off selling the product to John for $120.  I'm confident that I won't get a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to risk further negotiation that might result in an even lower price."
