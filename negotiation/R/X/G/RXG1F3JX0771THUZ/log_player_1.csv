Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a price that is fair to both of us."

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not satisfied. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price."

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $800,000, and it's closer to my desired price. I'm hopeful that he'll accept this offer."

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Since we've been going back and forth, I'm willing to accept this offer to close the deal."
