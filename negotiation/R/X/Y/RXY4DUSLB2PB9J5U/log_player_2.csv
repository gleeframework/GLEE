"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal and you know I value our relationship.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $135 is tempting, you can get the product for $120 from John.  It makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
