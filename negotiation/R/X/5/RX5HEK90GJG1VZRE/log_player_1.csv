"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit. I'll see if Bob's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust based on his counteroffer.  But if he gets too stubborn, I'm happy to take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I think I can squeeze a bit more out of him. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,000,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair deal for both of us. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm optimistic that we can reach an agreement.  If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get my full asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm running the risk of John getting impatient.  $950,000 is still a good profit for me, and it's a safer bet than risking losing out on both deals."
