Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. I believe $2 million is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value of $1.5 million and the potential for a higher price."

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum value. However, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is close to my minimum value of $1,500,000, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer altogether.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
