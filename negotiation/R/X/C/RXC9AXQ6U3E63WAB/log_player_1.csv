Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still ensuring a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering it slightly below John's offer ($150) increases the likelihood Bob will accept, guaranteeing a profit. 

By setting the price at $145, we increase the chances of a quick sale to Bob while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price."
