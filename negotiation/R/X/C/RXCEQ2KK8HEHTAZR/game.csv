"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $850,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to meet my minimum price to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $850,000 and $1,200,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",1025000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,025,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $962,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",962500.0,Alice,5,,
