"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her willingness to move from her initial position.
* **Strategic Undercut:** My offer is slightly below my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This allows me to potentially secure a deal for less while still having some wiggle room if Alice counters.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  If Alice is unwilling to negotiate down significantly, I can always walk away and take that deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being open to negotiation. While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,000,000? That's a fair offer, and it would allow me to make the purchase today."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:** I'm now offering my maximum budget.  This signals to Alice that this is my absolute limit, and I'm serious about making a deal. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's time to see if Alice is genuinely willing to come down to a price that works for me.
* **John's Offer:** My backup option of buying from John for $1,000,000 is becoming more appealing as time goes on. Alice needs to make a compelling case for me to go higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is really pushing the lower limits of what I can accept for this product.  It's truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment. Would you consider $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **At an Impasse:**  Alice is clearly not willing to come down to my maximum budget of $1,000,000. Her latest offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly above what I'm willing to pay.
* **Limited Time:**  We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and there's no guarantee that Alice will budge significantly in the remaining time.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is a sure thing. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with. 

Continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point carries the risk of either overpaying or running out of time and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John."
