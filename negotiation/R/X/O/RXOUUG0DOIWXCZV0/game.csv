"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be happy to purchase it for $11500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12500. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but I can't go any lower. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12000, but I'm really hoping we can close the deal at that price.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
