Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $120 but well below your minimum of $150. This strategy aims to:

* **Encourage Bob to negotiate:**  By not offering the full $150, you signal that you are open to negotiation and could potentially reach a price both of you are happy with.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** This strategy allows for back-and-forth negotiations, potentially leading to a higher price for you.
* **Secure a sale quickly:**  If Bob is willing to pay $140, you can close the deal without delaying further. 

Remember, this is just a starting point. You can adjust the price and message based on Bob's reaction and your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $120, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $150.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:** You've shown Bob that you're not desperate to sell at a lower price.
* **Negotiate further:** You can attempt to reach a price closer to your target by making a counteroffer.
* **Explore the possibility of John's offer:** If negotiations with Bob stall, you have the option of selling to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget, $130 is a bit low for me. How about $135? I'm open to finalizing the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** The price of $135 represents a compromise, closer to Bob's offer while still being above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer and demonstrates your flexibility to reach a compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Push Bob closer to your desired price:**  The price is still lower than your preferred $150, but it shows that you are willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain control of the negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you retain control of the negotiation.
* **Increase the chances of a successful deal:** By being flexible and willing to negotiate, you increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'll have to pass on $135. Can you meet me at $125? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of further lowering your price outweighs the potential gains.  Here's why:

* **John's Offer is Secure:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay your minimum price of $150. This eliminates any risk of ending up with a lower price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiations with Bob have gone on for a few rounds, and there's no guarantee that he will budge further.  
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could consume valuable time that you could spend pursuing other sales opportunities.

By choosing to sell to John, you maximize your profit and avoid the potential risks associated with further negotiation."
