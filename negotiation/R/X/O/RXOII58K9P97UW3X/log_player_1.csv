Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $500,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but not so high that Bob walks away.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You're starting with a strong but justifiable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  You're emphasizing the product's benefits to Bob, justifying the cost.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting or moving on to John's offer.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Confidence, clear communication, and a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement are key to successful negotiation."
