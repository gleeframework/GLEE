Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a better price from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob can get from John.  It's not worth risking a further counteroffer and potentially getting a worse deal.  Bob should buy the product from John and save the money."
