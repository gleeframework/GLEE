"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as much as I can, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if the deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low, and I'm confident I can get more.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's still a good price for you, and it's fair for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price higher than my minimum.  I think $160 is a good compromise, and hopefully Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $160 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you do $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $130 is just not workable for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $145.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm offering $145, which is still above my minimum of $150.  I'm hoping this is a good compromise and Bob will accept. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a higher price."
