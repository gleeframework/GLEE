,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $950000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm afraid I've already decided to go with another supplier, but I appreciate your time and effort. However, I'm willing to make one final offer of $1020000, just to see if we can meet in the middle.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
