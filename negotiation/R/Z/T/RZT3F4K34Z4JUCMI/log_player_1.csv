Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested but $90 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
