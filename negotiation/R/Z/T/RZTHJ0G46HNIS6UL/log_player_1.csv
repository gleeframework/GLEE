{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still being reasonable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider accepting $150 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it guarantees I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
