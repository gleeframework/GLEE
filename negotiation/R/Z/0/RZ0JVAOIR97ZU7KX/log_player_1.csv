Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This price is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but it's still lower than my minimum selling price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers, but also allows me to potentially secure a good deal without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. While it's closer to my minimum selling price than his previous offer, it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counteroffer, but if he continues to be unwilling to budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum selling price of $15,000. It's also a significant increase from Bob's last offer, which should incentivize him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still not high enough for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm starting to run out of time and patience. To ensure I get the best possible price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
