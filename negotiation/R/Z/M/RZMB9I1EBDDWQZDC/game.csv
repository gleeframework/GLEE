"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below $115. How about $110? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $110 is still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference - $112.50. That's the last compromise I can make.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $112.50. I'm willing to meet you at $110, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to go any higher.",110.0,Bob,6,
