"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $5,500?",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $6,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great compromise.",6500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $6,000, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm offering the product to you for $6,250. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",6250.0,Alice,5,
