"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $90 is a good price, but it's still worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting allows for negotiation and potentially getting an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! $90 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you consider $75?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $82.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $82.50 is still higher than my target price of $75, but it's closer. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 4
