"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,800? It's a bit closer to what I was thinking, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can come to an agreement.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment, but I can't go below $8,000.  This product is truly worth that much, and it would be a loss for me to sell it for less.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,000? It's the minimum I can accept, and it would allow us to close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
