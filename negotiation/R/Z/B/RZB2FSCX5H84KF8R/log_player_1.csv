Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you should never sell for less than that.
* **Aiming high:**  Start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000).  A starting point of $19,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Confident approach:** The message to Bob positions the product as high-value without being overly aggressive.  

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility to negotiate with Bob. If you suspect Bob might be completely turned off by a price above his perceived value, you might start lower (but never below $15,000)."
