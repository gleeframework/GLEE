"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $180 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you an idea of Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite, acknowledges Alice's offer, and clearly states your counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While $100 is quite low, it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately.  The goal is to move the negotiation closer to your ideal price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $140 is better than her initial offer, it's still above your $120 maximum. There's room to negotiate further.
* **Alice is Willing to Negotiate:**  The fact that she countered your offer, even if it's not ideal, suggests she's open to finding a price that works for both of you. 
* **John is the Backup:** Remember, you can always buy from John for $120. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that $100 is a significant drop. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** You've reached your maximum budget, so it's time to be direct and firm with your offer.  
* **""Meet in the Middle"":** This phrasing suggests fairness and compromise, even though you're at your limit.
* **""Final Offer"":**  This lets Alice know you're serious and unlikely to budge. It may encourage her to accept or make a final counteroffer close to your price. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, if Alice rejects this offer, you can always buy from John for $120."
