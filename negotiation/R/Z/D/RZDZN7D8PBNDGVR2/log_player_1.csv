"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we're both looking for a fair deal, Alice. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still too low. I'll hold firm for now and counter in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. Let's settle at $1,250,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $1,212,500?

Bob is clearly committed to negotiating and has met me very close to my acceptable range. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him walking away and secures a price significantly above my fallback option with John."
