"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand we're both looking for a fair deal, Alice. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. Let's settle at $1,250,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $1,212,500?",1212500.0,Bob,6,
