Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I know Bob's value for the product is unknown, but I believe a $2 million offer is a good starting point to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell at that price,  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.  I'll counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but not by much. I'm aiming for a compromise at $1,750,000.  This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a profit greater than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

Bob has come up slightly in his offer, and I'm willing to accept it. This deal secures a profit of $100,000, which is better than selling to John for $1,500,000. Further negotiation could potentially yield a higher price, but the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and me having to sell to John for a lower price is too high."
