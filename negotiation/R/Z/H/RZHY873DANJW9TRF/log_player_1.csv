Bob's offer:

Even though Bob is getting closer, I'm still leaving a significant amount of money on the table if I accept $1,800,000.  I'll try to negotiate him up further."

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** $1,750,000 is a significant amount of money. Holding out for more risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Negotiation Pattern:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer in increments of $50,000.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Time Constraint:** We're running out of rounds, and the difference between Bob's current offer and a potentially slightly higher one isn't worth the risk of losing him completely. 

Accepting $1,750,000 secures a very good deal for the product."
