Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have insider information that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit of $2,000 over your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While a higher price (closer to $12,000) might be tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. A price of $10,000 is a strong starting point that allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while ensuring you gain a substantial profit. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net, allowing you to negotiate with Bob from a position of strength."
