Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, we aim for the highest price Bob might accept.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while exceeding your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This encourages him to consider the deal seriously.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive"" and mentioning a public listing, we create a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines."
