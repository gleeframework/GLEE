Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to increase his perceived value and make him more willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While closer to my desired price, $90 is still below my minimum of $120.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my target price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage in the negotiation.

I'll counter with a price slightly higher than $90 to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $95? It's still a fair price for the value of the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. $95 is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth.
* **Win-win framing:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario for both of us. 

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while also maintaining my goal of maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. This is my final offer as I am committed to staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **No room for further negotiation:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, indicating there's no room for further negotiation.
* **John offers a better price:** John is willing to pay $120, which is a significantly better deal for me.

While I would prefer to sell to Bob to establish a potential future relationship, the immediate financial gain with John makes selling to him the best choice."
