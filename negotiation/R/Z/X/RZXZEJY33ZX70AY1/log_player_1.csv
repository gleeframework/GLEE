Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher final price.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, you ""anchor"" the negotiation around that value. This can influence Bob's perception of what's reasonable.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a strong alternative option with John ($1,000,000), which gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price.

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while still protecting your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is above his perceived value of $800,000, showing he's willing to stretch. However, it's still significantly below your minimum of $1,000,000.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $950,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price. Could you consider a counteroffer closer to $1,150,000? This reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer ($1,300,000) and his counteroffer ($950,000), but leans slightly more in your favor. 
* **Signaling Value:**  Reiterating the product's ""true value"" reinforces that you're not willing to drastically undervalue it.
* **Encouraging Movement:** By making a substantial move yourself, you encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more significant counter. 

You are still above your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), but this offer opens the door for Bob to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming to keep my spending within my budget. Could we meet somewhere closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While you might have been able to push for a slightly higher amount, there's no guarantee Bob would go any higher. Accepting this offer ensures you get your minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
