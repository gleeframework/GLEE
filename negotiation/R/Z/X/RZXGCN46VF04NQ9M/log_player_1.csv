Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly less than I can accept. This product has a lot of untapped potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I'm still interested, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is my final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, his ""final offer"" language suggests he's unlikely to move much further. Accepting $900,000 is a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to move on."
