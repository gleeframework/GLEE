"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $12,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get a product worth $15,000 to you for a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, you can likely negotiate further with Alice to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable meeting you halfway at $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is a good price, you can still potentially negotiate further with Alice and try to get a lower price. You are closer to your target price of $10,000, so there is still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. Would you consider $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price significantly from the original $15,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is the lowest I can go. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer. While $13,500 is higher than your ideal price, it's still a significant discount compared to John's $15,000.  Further negotiation may be possible, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or you'll end up paying John's higher price."
