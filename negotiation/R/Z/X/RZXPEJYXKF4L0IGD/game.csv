"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable meeting you halfway at $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. Would you consider $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price significantly from the original $15,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is the lowest I can go. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
