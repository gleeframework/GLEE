(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  $18,000 is far above your budget of $8,000. It's definitely worth rejecting and attempting to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Explanation:** This is the maximum price I'm willing to pay.  It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still fair given the product's value to me.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate down to this price or at least come closer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:** $16,000 is still well above my budget.  I'm going to continue trying to negotiate a lower price.  I might even consider lowering my offer slightly in the next round, but I won't go above $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**  Alice is still pretty far away from my budget, but she's shown some willingness to negotiate. I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $9,000, which is still a significant discount from her last offer.  Hopefully, this will incentivize her to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**  Alice's offer is still far above my budget.  While she's shown some flexibility, it's not enough. I will continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price.  There's still a chance she'll come down further, and I'm not desperate enough to buy from John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:** I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $9,500.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product and willing to meet halfway.  However, I'm still holding firm to my budget and won't go any higher.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will finally convince Alice to negotiate further and come closer to my price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**  Alice's offer is still far too high.  While she's been willing to negotiate, she hasn't come down enough for me to accept. I'm going to keep pushing and see if I can get a better deal.  There's still time to negotiate, and I'm not ready to give up and buy from John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:** Alice has shown a stubborn streak in negotiations, so I'm going to make a bolder move.  $10,000 is a significant jump from my previous offer, but it's still far below what Alice is asking for.  I'm hoping this will finally signal to Alice that I'm serious about buying but will not go higher.  It's a risky move, but with only three rounds remaining, I need to see if I can force a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:** This is getting increasingly frustrating!  Alice is not budging and is starting to push me towards my absolute limit. With only one round left, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  It's best to accept John's offer and be done with this negotiation. While it's not the ideal price, it's within my budget, and at least I'm guaranteed to get the product."
