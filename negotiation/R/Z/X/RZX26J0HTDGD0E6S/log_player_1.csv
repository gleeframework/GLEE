Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit. I believe this price is high enough to be attractive to Bob, but not so high that it would immediately scare him off. I'm confident that I can negotiate down from this price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, and while I'd love to get even more, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  It's time to secure the sale and make a good profit."
