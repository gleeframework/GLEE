{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120), but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, indicating I'm open to negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and analyze whether it's worth my time to negotiate further. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a potential fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and would like to make a counteroffer of $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** While $130 is closer to my minimum of $150, I'm not desperate for a sale. There's a chance I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** John's offer of $150 serves as a safety net.  If Bob rejects my next counteroffer, I can walk away and still get my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $130. This will show him I'm serious about getting closer to my minimum price while also keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $135. Let's see if we can make this work!  "", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price than $130.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $135 is still above my minimum desired price of $150, so I'm not giving up on getting a better deal.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:**  I'm keeping the message positive and hopeful to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!  I've secured a sale with a decent profit margin. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully consider his next counteroffer and whether to accept it or offer a final counteroffer before moving on to John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with an offer of $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Further Compromise:** Bob has stuck to his initial counteroffer of $130, and I've already offered to come down to $135.  There's little room for further negotiation without accepting a loss.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $150 ensures I achieve my minimum desired price and avoids any further negotiation with Bob.  
* **Time is Money:** Continued negotiation could drag on and result in a lower final price.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price point.

**Next Steps:**

* I will reach out to John and finalize the sale for $150."
