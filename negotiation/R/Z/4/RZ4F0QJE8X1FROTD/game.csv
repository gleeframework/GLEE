"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your perspective on the price, $6,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $7,000 is still too low for me. Could you meet me at $8,000? That's the lowest I can go.",8000.0,Alice,5,
