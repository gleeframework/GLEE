"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive, hoping to establish a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for your product. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to counter with an offer of $8,200 for your product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my target price, I still believe I can get a bit more. There are still six rounds remaining, so I have time to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $8,200 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $8,350? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $8,300 for your product. This feels like a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. I hope you'll consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,300 is only $50 less than my last counteroffer. I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer will still give me a decent profit, and I can always try to negotiate a better price with future buyers."
