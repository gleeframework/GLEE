"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm proposing a price of $95 for it. This offer takes into account both the worth of the product to you and my desire to maximize the value I receive for it. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is closer to your maximum budget than John's offer, you know John is willing to sell the product for $80.  You can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or go directly to John and save $15."
