"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $800,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider something closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable price for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we try $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $700,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $800,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  It's also the best I can do at this point.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
