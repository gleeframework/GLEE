"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the value I can get out of the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is still significantly below his perceived value.  We have room to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this price point reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in making this deal happen, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob is clearly still willing to negotiate and is getting closer to a price point that would be very profitable. It's worth pushing a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value. How about we settle on $1,090,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, so how about $1,045,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,045,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,045,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is a significant jump downwards.  This signals either:
* Bob is getting impatient and might be willing to settle closer to our previous offer. 
* Bob is trying to anchor the negotiation lower and might not be willing to go much higher. 

It's a risk, but we still have room to negotiate above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but that offer is a significant step back from where we were. I'm still willing to find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,085,000?  This reflects my good faith in finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1085000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a slight compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,200,000. How about $1,075,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product, and it's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,075,000 is a significant profit margin, well above your minimum and John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob has signaled his maximum budget.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more, and risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation and potential delays."
