Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as much from Bob as possible before resorting to John's guaranteed $15,000 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he's very interested. 
* **Above Bob's Perceived Value:** While we know Bob values it at $10,000, the offer needs to be enticing without being ridiculously high.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
