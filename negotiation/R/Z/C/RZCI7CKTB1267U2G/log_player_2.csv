"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us - it's a fair price for you, and it's significantly more than I could get elsewhere. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice. While $11,500 isn't terrible, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer lower than what you're ultimately willing to pay. This leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Reasonable Range:** $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but still gives her a profit margin and is well below my maximum price.
* **Polite and Open:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is important to keep things moving smoothly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position. While $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's split the difference - how about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $11,000 is getting closer to a price I'd be happy with. However, there's still a chance to save more. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a lower price while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Again):** This counteroffer suggests a compromise by meeting Alice exactly in the middle of her most recent offer ($11,000) and my previous one ($10,500). This can be a strong negotiating tactic, especially if Alice is motivated to close the deal.
* **Respectful Tone:** I continue to use a respectful and collaborative tone to maintain a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Approaching my Limit:**  While I'm aiming to save as much as possible, I'm also aware that time is a factor. This counteroffer puts me in a strong position to accept if Alice agrees but leaves me a small buffer to negotiate further if needed."
