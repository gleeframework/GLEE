``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, hoping to leverage his desire for the product to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
