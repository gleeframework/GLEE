"I understand you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $13500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $12500.  This is truly my final offer, as I have another opportunity at that price.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12500. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you there just yet. I can offer it to you for $14000, which is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
