"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand it's a bit high for you, but $65 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That would still be a great price for you and a fair deal for me. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $85 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $75? That's the highest I can go.",75.0,Bob,4,
