Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really like it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's a reasonable offer:** $100 is significantly more than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but it's also less than what you absolutely need. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price a bit, and if he accepts, you still make a good profit. 
* **It's friendly:** Starting with a friendly tone might encourage Bob to negotiate further.

Remember, the key is to find a price that's acceptable to both of you!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $65 is better than nothing, it's still far below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  You have a better option with John, and even a chance to potentially get closer to your desired price by counteroffering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  While $85 is closer, my budget is really capped at $80. Would you be willing to come down to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While you'd ideally like to get closer to your desired $120, accepting Bob's offer of $80 is a good compromise. It's still above your minimum acceptable price of $120, and you're avoiding the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price.  Additionally, you're avoiding the need to sell to John, which would have resulted in a higher profit but potentially strained your relationship with Bob for future potential deals."
