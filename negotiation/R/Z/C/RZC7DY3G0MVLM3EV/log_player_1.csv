Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or concerns."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to aim higher with Bob to potentially earn a larger profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $13,500 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that's still above your minimum. 
* **Justify the Price:** Mentioning the ""value"" of the product hints at its worth being higher than what Bob might initially think, providing a basis for your asking price. 

This approach aims to find a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price and ensuring you don't miss out on the guaranteed sale to John."
