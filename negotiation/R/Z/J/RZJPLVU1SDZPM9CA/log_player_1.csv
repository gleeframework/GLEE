{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You want to maximize your profit, so $1,150,000 is a good starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You want to leave some wiggle room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $1,150,000 is still below what Bob is willing to pay, making it more likely he'll accept.

Remember, the goal is to find a price where both of you feel like you've gotten a good deal.  You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than the $1,150,000 you initially offered and leaves less room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your leverage:** By showing that you are willing to walk away, you demonstrate your confidence in the product's value and maintain a stronger negotiating position.
* **Explore a counteroffer:** You can make a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price point, aiming to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $1,050,000 and your initial $1,150,000. Be prepared to adjust your price depending on Bob's reaction."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer balances a few factors:

* **Meeting halfway:** It's a compromise between your previous offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000.
* **Still profitable:**  $1,100,000 is above your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you earn a good profit.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  You're still not accepting Bob's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to walk away if necessary.

This counteroffer aims to show flexibility while still keeping the negotiation in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,075,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit and me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,075,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still a significant loss compared to the $1,100,000 counteroffer you just made.  Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Push for a higher price:**  You can make a new counteroffer closer to $1,100,000, trying to find a middle ground with Bob. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  Showing you're not willing to settle for his price reinforces your position and could encourage him to come closer to your desired price.

**Next Steps:**

You should send a new counteroffer to Bob, perhaps offering $1,090,000 or $1,085,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still striving for a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. Let's aim for a price that works for both of us. How about $1,085,000?  It's a little closer to your offer, but still allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1085000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** It's a compromise between your previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $1,075,000.
* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Maintain leverage:** It's still higher than Bob's last offer, suggesting you are not desperate to sell.

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, you show flexibility without compromising too much on your profit."
