"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has potential, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
