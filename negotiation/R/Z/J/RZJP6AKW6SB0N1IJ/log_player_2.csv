# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
