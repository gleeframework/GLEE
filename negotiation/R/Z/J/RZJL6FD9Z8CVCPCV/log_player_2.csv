"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, accepting Alice's offer of $15,000 is not a good deal. Buying from John for $10,000 is the best option, but we can try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by significantly lowering the price to a point where Alice might be willing to negotiate. It's a bold move, but Bob is trying to get the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum value.  It's worth another attempt at negotiation to try and push the price down further."

Bob is trying to find a compromise price, closer to his maximum value of $10,000 but still acknowledging Alice's need for some profit. This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still too high for Bob. While negotiating further is possible, it's likely Alice will remain firm, and Bob's time is valuable.  It's better to cut his losses and purchase the product from John for $10,000, ensuring a price within his budget."
