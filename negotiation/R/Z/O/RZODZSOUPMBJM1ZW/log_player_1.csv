Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

``` 
Explanation:

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $12,500 is a strong deal. It provides a significant profit over my minimum ($8,000) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away. It's always possible he'd go higher, but there's also the chance negotiations could stall, leaving me with John's lower offer.
