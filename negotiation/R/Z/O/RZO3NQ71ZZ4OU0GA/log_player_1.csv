Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than your minimum:**  $115 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $115 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to potentially counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Shows confidence:**  Starting with a higher price can make it seem like you believe in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to try to get a bit more. I can always sell to John for $100, so I have room to negotiate."
