Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I think that's a fair price considering the value I know you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,500. Since you can get the product for $12,000 from John, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal and buy from John."
