# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?
