"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $120, which is less than John's price of $150.
* **You can still save money:**  Even though you value the product at $150, buying it from Alice for $120 means you save $30."
