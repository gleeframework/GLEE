"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's target price of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get it closer to my budget.  How about $10,500?  That leaves us both with a little room to breathe.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above Bob's target.  Bob is willing to negotiate further and hopes to get the price down even more.  Rejecting allows Bob another round to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,800 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $10,600. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,700. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,700 is within Bob's budget and only $700 above his target price.  Bob has already rejected two offers, and further negotiation might risk Alice walking away.  It's a good deal for Bob and secures the product."
