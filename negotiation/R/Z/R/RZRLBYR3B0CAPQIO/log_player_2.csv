"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget.  You are aiming to save as much money as possible, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit low, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget.  You're determined to save as much money as possible, so rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to offer $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can do $11,200, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,200 is still above your budget. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the price might not drop further, or it might take several more rounds.  At this point, buying the product from John for $10,000 guarantees you get the product within your budget and avoids any further negotiation."
