"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and provides a fair starting point for our discussion.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $950,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects a fair price given my needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $850,000 falls short of what I believe is fair.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  This feels like a strong compromise that recognizes the product's worth.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $925,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my needs.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
