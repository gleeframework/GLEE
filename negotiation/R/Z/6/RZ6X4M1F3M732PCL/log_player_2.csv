"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and provides a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $850,000 falls short of what I believe is fair.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  This feels like a strong compromise that recognizes the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  He's still better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice than buying from John. There's still a potential for Alice to come down closer to Bob's target range."

I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my needs.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
