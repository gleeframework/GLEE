Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still significantly above my budget.  To make this work, I'd need to come in at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves room for us to both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still below my target price.

This is the lowest price I can consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.
