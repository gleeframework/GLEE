"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price point. I'm offering $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents excellent value for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
