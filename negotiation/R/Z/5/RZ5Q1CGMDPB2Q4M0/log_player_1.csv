Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially settling somewhere above your minimum ($120).
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at Bob's maximum valuation ($150) might make him feel cheated and less likely to accept.

This approach balances maximizing potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
