Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think this is a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500 is a good starting point:** It's a significant profit for me, but also leaves room for negotiation and ensures Bob isn't immediately discouraged.
* **The message is friendly and open:**  This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and consider my offer. 
* **I acknowledge Bob's potential value for the product:** This shows that I'm aware of his perspective and that I'm not just trying to get the highest possible price.

This offer sets the stage for a productive negotiation. I'm open to adjusting the price based on Bob's counteroffer, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you consider $10500?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500 is too low:** While it's better than selling to John for $10,000, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my ideal. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at any price.  I'm ready to make a counteroffer that I believe is more fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $11,000? That's still a good price for both of us, and it's closer to my asking price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is closer to my desired price:**  $11,000 is a compromise that's still profitable for me but shows a willingness to move towards Bob's offer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and optimistic, aiming to continue the negotiation in a collaborative way.
* **Highlight the benefits of the deal:** I emphasize that $11,000 is a good deal for both of us, encouraging Bob to see it as a win-win scenario.

By making this counter-offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm open to compromise, while still holding firm on my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference.  Would you consider $10750?  I think this price is fair to us both and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,750 is a good compromise:** It's a significant profit for me, surpassing the $10,000 I would get from John.
* **Negotiation has reached a stalemate:** Bob has shown a clear price point he is willing to pay. Further negotiation might lead to more back-and-forth and potential lost time.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting this offer ensures I secure a sale and avoid the possibility of Bob withdrawing completely or me getting stuck with a lower price.

This is a situation where accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy, considering the potential risks and the fact that it is significantly better than selling to John."
