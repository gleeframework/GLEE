"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $12,000 and Alice's initial offer is $12,000, it's not worth engaging in further negotiation. You can buy the product from John for the same price, avoiding the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffers and potentially losing the opportunity."
