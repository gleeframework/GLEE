"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, knowing it's below the product's value to Bob but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the benefit to Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute maximum price to give Bob space to counteroffer and create a sense of collaboration. 
* **Keeping in mind the John option:** I'm aware of the $10,000 backup option, so I'm not willing to go below that price for too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $10,500 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob.
* **Negotiating is key:** I have 10 rounds and can make counteroffers. It's better to try to get a higher price from Bob than to settle for John's offer. 
* **Next round:**  I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, hopefully, finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $10,500 is a good deal for you, but it's a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell for $11,750.  This gives us both a fair outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a counteroffer of $11,750, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Reasoning:** This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Positive tone:** I'm staying friendly and positive, hoping to keep the negotiation open and productive.
* **Keeping the end goal in mind:** While $11,750 is still lower than my ideal price, it's significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $11,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider $11,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** Bob's offer of $11,200 is very close to my minimum price of $10,000. It's a good compromise, and accepting it guarantees a sale and a decent profit.
* **Time is a factor:** We are already in round 4, and it's getting closer to the end of the negotiation window. 
* **Avoiding risks:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of success. It's better to take the sure thing and close the deal with Bob.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that's above my minimum and ensuring a profit. It's a good balance between maximizing earnings and managing the risk of further negotiation."
