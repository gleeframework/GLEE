Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling around $850,000 - $900,000.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy for $800,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving you leverage in the negotiation.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have a single opportunity to make an offer to Bob. If you could make multiple offers or counter-offers, the strategy might change."
