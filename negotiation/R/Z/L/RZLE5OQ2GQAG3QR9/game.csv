"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $16000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's fair to me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm really serious about buying this, and I'm willing to pay $15500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and lets us close this deal. Let me know what you think!",15500.0,Bob,4,
