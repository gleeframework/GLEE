Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be realistic about the value.  Would you consider $1,200,000? This is my final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and it's still above your maximum price and John's offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice won't budge, and you'll end up with no deal. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price."
