"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and still allows you to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still unable to meet at $13,500. I would like to propose $12,800 as a final offer. I hope this meets somewhere closer to your expectations.",12800.0,Bob,4,
