"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still more than the product's worth to Bob.  There's room for negotiation.  It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob's initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above the product's value to him. This shows that he's serious about buying the product but wants a fair price. 
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer establishes a clear starting point for negotiation and leaves room for further adjustments. 
* **Staying within budget:**  $9,500 is still well within Bob's budget and gives him a good margin for potential counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more reflective of that.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $10,250 is still higher than what Bob ideally wants to pay. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to push for a lower price. 
* **John's offer:**  While John offers a higher price, Bob hasn't exhausted all options with Alice yet. 

Bob should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,875? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows that Bob is taking Alice's offer seriously and is willing to compromise. By splitting the difference, he's demonstrating a willingness to find common ground.
* **Staying within Budget:** $9,875 is still within Bob's budget and allows room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Staying Competitive:** While Bob is willing to pay a bit more, he's still keeping his price lower than John's offer, ensuring he's getting the best deal possible. 

This counteroffer presents a reasonable price and demonstrates Bob's commitment to finding a solution that works for both parties."
