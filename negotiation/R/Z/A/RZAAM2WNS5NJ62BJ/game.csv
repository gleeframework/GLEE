"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $7500 for the product. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8500 is closer, I'm still limited to $8000.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we can find a compromise.  How about $8000 and we call it a day?",8000.0,Bob,4,
