Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a valuable item that I'm sure you'll find beneficial. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and encouraging to build rapport with Bob.

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started while maintaining a strong bargaining position."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $10,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our last two offers. This shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that the price is fair for both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Urgency:** I'm not explicitly mentioning the remaining rounds, but the tone implies that we're getting closer to a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $11500. Would you be willing to go down to $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is only $1,000 away from my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but I'd rather get a deal with Bob than risk losing the sale entirely and having to settle for John's $10,000 offer. Accepting this offer secures a sale and provides me with a decent profit."
