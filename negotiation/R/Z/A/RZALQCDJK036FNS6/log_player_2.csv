"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it would be a perfect fit for your needs. We are offering this exclusive item to you at an introductory price of $1,300,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a product that is worth $1,500,000 to you, at a significant discount. We look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's a discount from the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000), it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offers and potentially a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $1,500,000 provides a baseline for Bob's negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as you've stated your minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration, we're pleased to provide you with a counteroffer of $1,275,000 for the product. We believe this price strikes a balance between our minimum acceptable price and your proposed offer. We hope this proposal will be more agreeable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget.**  $1,275,000 is well below Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000.
* **It's a good compromise.** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate might save a bit more, but it risks losing the deal entirely or wasting valuable time.
* **John's offer provides a safety net.**  Bob can always go to John if this deal falls through.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of a stalemate or Alice rejecting the deal entirely is high. This offer provides a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
