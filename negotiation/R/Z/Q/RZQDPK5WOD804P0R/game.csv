"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $105 for it,  what do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $115 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $110. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",112.5,Alice,5,
