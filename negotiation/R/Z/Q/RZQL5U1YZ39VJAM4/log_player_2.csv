Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's still a fair price for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is closer to your offer.  This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

Alice's final offer matches the price John is willing to sell for. There's no point in negotiating further or going to John since we've reached the best possible price."
