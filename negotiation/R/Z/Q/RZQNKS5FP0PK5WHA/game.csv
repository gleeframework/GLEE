"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit of a price difference, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's see if we can find common ground.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $127.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",127.5,Alice,5,
