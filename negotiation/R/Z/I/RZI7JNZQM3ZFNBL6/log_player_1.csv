"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters and allows me to gauge his interest level.  If he rejects this offer, I'll reassess and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I need to find a price that's more favorable to me, but also still appealing enough to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates my firm stance while also leaving room for some potential compromise if Bob is willing to increase his offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me at this price."
