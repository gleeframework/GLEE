Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum value and John's offer as benchmarks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll counter his offer to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a great deal for a product worth at least $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87.5 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not confident that I can push Bob any higher, and John is guaranteed to give me my minimum value. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed outcome, and I'm willing to accept that to avoid further negotiation."
