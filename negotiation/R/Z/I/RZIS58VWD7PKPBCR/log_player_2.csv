"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, there's a chance to get it even lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. By offering $10,000, he's showing a willingness to negotiate seriously while also leaving room for potential compromise. This counteroffer is a substantial step down from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's commitment to getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, but he's still determined to save more.  By rejecting again, Bob can continue to push for a lower price. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but he's still below Alice's last offer.  This shows that he's willing to negotiate but also that he's not going to drastically increase his offer.  He's aiming for a price that's fair to both parties and will hopefully lead to a deal before he has to resort to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now matched Bob's counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob, as he's secured a price significantly lower than his initial target of $15,000. Accepting the offer ensures a successful purchase while avoiding the risk of further negotiation or having to buy from John at a higher price."
