"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

As Bob, my goal is to save money. Since Alice's initial offer is at my maximum price point, there's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to explore if Alice is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This aggressive approach might push Alice to negotiate seriously.  While I'm open to further negotiation, I want to establish my willingness to walk away if a reasonable price isn't reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price by $1,000, which is a significant step towards my goal of saving money.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, accepting this offer guarantees I get the product for less than my maximum price and avoids further rounds of potentially unsuccessful negotiation.  The risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer and ultimately getting the product for $12,000 from John outweighs the potential to save an additional $1,000."
