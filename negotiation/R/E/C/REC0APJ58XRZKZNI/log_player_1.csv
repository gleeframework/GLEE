Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000. This sets a high initial benchmark and gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $1,400,000 still leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a terrible deal. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage a positive response.

**Important Note:**  This is just the initial offer.  Based on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy. For example, if he counteroffers too low, I might be willing to lower my price slightly.  However, I have the option to walk away and sell to John if I feel like I'm not getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a large financial loss. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's interested.  I can likely negotiate a better price in the next round.
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer. This gives me leverage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum value. I'll aim for a price that's still attractive to Bob but closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This is a significant reduction but still keeps the price above my minimum value. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm lowering the price, I'm still not giving away too much.  The offer is high enough to potentially entice Bob while reminding him of the product's value.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits of reaching an agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects again, I'll need to consider whether to further lower my price, or if it's time to sell to John and walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would be a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate further.  I can likely push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **John's Offer Remains:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a viable option, giving me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer. I'll aim for something between $1,250,000 and $1,300,000, continuing to move closer to Bob's offer but not giving up on my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm confident we can finalize this deal if you agree. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum value. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $1,300,000 and Bob's offer of $1,150,000. 
* **Positive and Urgent Tone:**  The message is encouraging and creates a sense of urgency, suggesting that this might be the final offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John. However, I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."
