"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm confident we can finalize this deal if you agree. Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Alice,5,
