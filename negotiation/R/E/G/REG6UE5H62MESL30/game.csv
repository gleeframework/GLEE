"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to do $140? ",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, I appreciate you taking a look.  $140 is a bit too low for me, unfortunately. How about we split the difference and go with $160?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
