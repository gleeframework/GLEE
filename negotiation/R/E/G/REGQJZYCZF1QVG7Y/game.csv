"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $850,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $900,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
