"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we discuss a price around $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This offers a significant value to you while still allowing me to recoup a reasonable amount for the product. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility shown. Based on our previous discussion, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This offers a compromise between our positions and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
