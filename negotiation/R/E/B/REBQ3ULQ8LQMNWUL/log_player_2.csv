{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget**, but you're trying to save as much money as possible. 
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** There's potential to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option**, but you should only resort to that if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** Starting with a significantly lower price ($1,000,000) will immediately signal your intent to negotiate aggressively.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  There's a significant gap between your offer and Alice's asking price, allowing for potential back-and-forth negotiations.
* **Balance risk and reward:** This offer is still within your budget and holds a significant potential for saving money."

* **There's still room for improvement.**  You can potentially secure a lower price with another counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option**, but it's not necessary at this point. You have multiple rounds left and the opportunity to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a significant savings.
* **Middle ground:**  It's a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer, potentially encouraging her to accept.
* **Time is still on your side:** You have six rounds remaining to continue negotiating if Alice rejects this offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This counteroffer is just slightly lower than Alice's previous offer, indicating you're almost at your limit. 
* **Time pressure:**  With only four rounds left, this could be your last chance to negotiate a lower price.
* **Risk assessment:** While this offer is closer to Alice's desired price, it's still within your budget, and it's a good compromise considering the limited rounds remaining."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only three rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.
* **Alice's offer is close to your budget:** It's only $50,000 above your previous counteroffer and within your budget.
* **Buying from John is a less attractive option:**  It's only $50,000 more expensive than Alice's offer, and you risk getting stuck with the higher price if negotiations fail.

While you might have been able to negotiate a slightly lower price with more time, it's wise to accept this offer to secure the product and avoid the risk of paying the higher price from John."
