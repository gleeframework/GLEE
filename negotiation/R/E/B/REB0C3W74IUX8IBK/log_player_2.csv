{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum budget, hoping to get Alice to agree to a price that is closer to my ideal value for the product. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but I'm hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower, it is still above my budget. I am confident that I can push for a better deal in the following rounds.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be coming down in price, so I'm going to continue with a counteroffer that is a bit higher than my previous offer. $1,375,000 is a good middle ground between my last offer and Alice's current price. I believe this could be a point of agreement, as it still keeps me below my maximum budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not ready to accept her offer. It's getting more tempting to buy from John, but I still have time to negotiate a better price with Alice. I'm going to continue to push for a lower price, hoping that she'll come down to my preferred range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting closer to my maximum budget, and with only three rounds left, I want to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. However, I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer. This counteroffer of $1,450,000 is a compromise, increasing my bid while still staying within a reasonable range."
