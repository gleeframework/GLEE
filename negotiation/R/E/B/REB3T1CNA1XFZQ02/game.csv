"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $8,200 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal right away.",8000.0,Bob,4,
