"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your budget, and you're aiming to save as much as possible. It's always a good strategy to start by rejecting an initial offer and then counter-offering to show you're serious about negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** Starting with a lower offer shows your commitment to saving money.  $900,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your negotiating stance.
* **Focus on Shared Goals:** Mentioning ""common ground"" acknowledges that both parties want to make a deal. This helps maintain a positive tone. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The counteroffer is not a final number, allowing for back-and-forth in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's a step in the right direction, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, indicating there's still room to lower the price further. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation process.
* **Potential to Reach a Better Price:** By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, you might be able to get closer to your goal of securing the product for under $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Focus on Fair Price:** The message emphasizes finding a ""fair price"" to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and equity.
* **Firm but Not Unreasonable:** $1,000,000 is a firm stance, but it's also within the range of what Alice might accept given the current negotiations.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Mentioning ""closing the deal"" adds a sense of urgency and a nudge to finalize the transaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1000000 is my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint, but I need a slight premium for the product's unique features. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1025000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Alice's offer is still above your target of saving as much money as possible.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  Alice has clearly set her minimum price, and further negotiation may not lead to a significant decrease.
* **Alternative Option:**  You can now purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within your budget and a better price than Alice's latest offer.

By purchasing from John, you avoid the risk of further negotiation and can secure the product within your budget."
