Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I should try to get the price closer to $11,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. While I'd like to accommodate you, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $10,500. Our product's value aligns closely with its cost, and at $11,500, it represents a fair compromise considering the quality and benefits it offers. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 to move forward with our transaction.

Alice has come down $500, and her current offer of $11,000 is a reasonable price. It's unlikely I'll get a much better deal, especially considering John's offer is $12,000."
