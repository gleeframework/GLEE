"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $13,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,750. I can offer you the product for $11,250. It's still a good deal for both of us, considering the value you'll get from it.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand your constraints, but I'm not willing to accept $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",11200.0,Alice,7,
