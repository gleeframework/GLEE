"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth more than your maximum price.  It makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

This is a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is meant to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly.  If she rejects, we can continue to negotiate, but we've already established our willingness to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Alice is still above our maximum price. While this is closer, it's still too high. We need to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

We're increasing our offer, showing we're serious about buying.  This is still below Alice's current price, and should give us some wiggle room for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice is getting closer to our desired price, we can still potentially do better.  Rejecting allows us to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

We're increasing our offer again, showing Alice we're serious about getting a deal. This price is only $100,000 away from John's offer, so we're getting close to the point where it might be worthwhile to just buy from John.  We want to see if Alice is willing to come down just a little more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is only $20,000 better than John's offer.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation.  We can get the product from John for a lower price, so let's go with that."
