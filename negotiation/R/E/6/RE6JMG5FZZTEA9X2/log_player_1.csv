"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and your potential profits. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This gives room for negotiation and allows for potential gains. 
* **Positive message:**  The message emphasizes fairness and potential profits for Bob to make him more receptive to the offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I leave space for Bob to counteroffer, knowing I have a backup option in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a significant improvement from his previous offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I have a backup option in John, so I can afford to push for a better price. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000.  This price allows for a substantial profit for you and ensures a fair deal for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping a significant profit margin for me.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** The message reiterates the potential profit for Bob and highlights the fairness of the price.
* **Creating pressure:**  By offering a specific number and using a phrase like ""meet you halfway,"" I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet at $1200000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Despite his commitment to buying, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the negotiations, and I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might become the most appealing option.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'll continue to counteroffer, but I need to be more assertive and try to push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your commitment.  However, $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try $1,350,000.  This is a final compromise from my end.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  This counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my previous offer, signaling a willingness to compromise while maintaining my position.
* **""Final compromise"" tactic:** Using this phrase creates a sense of finality and pressure on Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer seriously.
* **Warning of alternative options:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob that I have a backup buyer (John) and am not desperate for a sale. 

**Strategy:**

At this point, I'm aiming for a quick resolution. The ""final compromise"" tactic should encourage Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. If he rejects again, I'm prepared to move on to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  Despite his finality, Bob's offer remains below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiations with only 4 rounds left.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and eliminates the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob. 

I've made significant concessions, but Bob isn't budging from his offer. The potential gains from continued negotiations with Bob are not worth the risk of losing time and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  Selling to John is the most financially sound and time-efficient option."
