"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $800,000 to you and I'm confident we can make this work.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your offer, but unfortunately, $750,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $825,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $775,000 still isn't enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
