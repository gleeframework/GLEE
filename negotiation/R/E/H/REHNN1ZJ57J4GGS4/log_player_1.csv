{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, increasing our profit.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** This price ensures that even if Bob negotiates down, we're still likely to get a better deal than John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If we knew Bob was a tough negotiator, we might start even higher. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If there was a time crunch, we might lower the price to ensure a quick sale."
