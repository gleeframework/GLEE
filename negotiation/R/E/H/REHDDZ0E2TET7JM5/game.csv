"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's truly unique and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your operations. I'm asking for $1,700,000 for it, which reflects its high quality and potential.  What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000 to try and make this deal work. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,475,000.  This is a fair price considering the value the product brings.  Let's try to close this deal.",1475000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close! I'm willing to bump my offer up slightly to $1,450,000. I believe that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal today.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're almost there! I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm also committed to getting a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,460,000, which is just a small step away from your offer. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1460000.0,Alice,7,
