It's not worth it to buy the product for $9,000 when I can get it for $8,000 from John.  I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better price from her."

I'm offering Alice $7,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the fact that I can get it for $8,000 elsewhere."

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm going to buy the product from John for $8,000, as that's within my budget and the best price I can get at the moment."
