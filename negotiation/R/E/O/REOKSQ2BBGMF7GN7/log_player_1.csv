"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80, and it's likely we can close the deal quickly. It's better to take the offer now than risk further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price."
