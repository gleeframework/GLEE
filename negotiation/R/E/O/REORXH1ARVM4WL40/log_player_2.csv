"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get the product for a lower price by counteroffering.  $900,000 is still too high, and there's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits you'll gain from it.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is still too high for Bob. He can try to negotiate further.  Even though buying from John for $1,000,000 is an option, there's still potential to get a better deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking $910,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits you'll gain from it.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price. He has room to make one more counteroffer before he needs to consider buying from John."
