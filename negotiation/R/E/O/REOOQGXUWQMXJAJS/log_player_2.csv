# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $11,500 for the product. This price reflects its high quality and the significant return it will provide for you. I'm confident this offer will be mutually beneficial and help us establish a long-lasting relationship.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than John's offer of $12,000, but you can potentially get a better deal. You should reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with her or potentially find another seller with an even lower price."
