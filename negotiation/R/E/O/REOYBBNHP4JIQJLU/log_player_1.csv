Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will be telling. If he accepts immediately, I might have gone a little low. If he rejects outright, I can always come down to $120 knowing I have John as a backup.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives me leverage. I don't have to desperately sell to Bob."
