"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $13,000.  I believe it holds significant value and this offer reflects that. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,500 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $11,500?  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in this product, but $11,500 is still outside my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
