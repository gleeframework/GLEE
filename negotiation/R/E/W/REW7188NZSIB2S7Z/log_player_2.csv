"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $13,000.  I believe it holds significant value and this offer reflects that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for a much lower price.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but there's no reason to accept this offer."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget and he can get the product from John for a lower price.  He should try to negotiate further with Alice."
