"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal while leaving room for negotiation. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not close enough to my desired price. I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob and explore a better deal. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the counteroffer. However, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $1,400,000. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept while still ensuring a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my current budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price point. I have time to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,350,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,375,000. This is a compromise, but it's closer to my minimum and reflects the value I place on the product. By emphasizing a ""fair price"" and focusing on mutual benefits, I hope to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
