"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. $1,450,000 is still too high, and you can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the counteroffer. However, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,400,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you'd like to pay.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my current budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,350,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$1,375,000 is a good compromise that is within your budget, and it's likely you won't get a better price from Alice.  It's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal."
