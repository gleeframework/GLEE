Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth at least $1,000,000 in the value it could bring. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  I think it's a small premium for something that could yield such significant returns."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 provides a strong starting point. Aiming slightly higher allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the potential return on investment for Bob helps justify the price. If Bob truly believes it's worth a million, a slight markup for the value it offers might be palatable.
* **Backup Plan:**  The safety net of John's offer allows for a bolder initial ask. If Bob rejects it, you haven't lost anything. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a more dynamic negotiation, observing Bob's reaction and adjusting accordingly would be crucial."
