"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I propose that you purchase the product for $12,000. This price reflects its high value and the significant benefit it will bring to you, given its worth to you is $8,000. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I would like to accommodate you, I must maintain the integrity of the product's value. I am unable to accept $6,000 for this item. My counteroffer is $9,000. This price still allows for a reasonable profit while considering the product's worth to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. I'm glad we're closing in on an agreement. Considering the value of the product to you, I propose we settle on $8,500. This price still allows for a reasonable profit while being more accessible to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. It's in your best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000 rather than risking further negotiation with Alice."
