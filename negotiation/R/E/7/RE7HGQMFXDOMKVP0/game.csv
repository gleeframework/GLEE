"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I propose that you purchase the product for $12,000. This price reflects its high value and the significant benefit it will bring to you, given its worth to you is $8,000. I look forward to your response.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I would like to accommodate you, I must maintain the integrity of the product's value. I am unable to accept $6,000 for this item. My counteroffer is $9,000. This price still allows for a reasonable profit while considering the product's worth to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. I'm glad we're closing in on an agreement. Considering the value of the product to you, I propose we settle on $8,500. This price still allows for a reasonable profit while being more accessible to your budget.",8500.0,Alice,5,
