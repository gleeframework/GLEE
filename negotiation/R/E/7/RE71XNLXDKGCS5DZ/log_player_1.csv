Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) allows room to potentially earn more.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Negotiation Starter:** This high initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. Even if he negotiates down, you're still likely to land a deal significantly higher than your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
