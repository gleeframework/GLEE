"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd find very useful. My asking price is $120. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  A $120 offer allows for multiple rounds of counteroffers before reaching my minimum.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a positive and open tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is a good starting point, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for higher negotiation:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob, and I want to explore that possibility before resorting to selling to John. 
* **Maintaining control:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to remain in control of the negotiation and set the next price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him strengthens my position.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone can encourage Bob to accept the counteroffer."
