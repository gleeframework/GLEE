"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd find very useful. My asking price is $120. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is within Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice ($80). There's room for negotiation, so it's more advantageous to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to secure a good deal. By offering $100, he's demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while also keeping the deal within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still above the product's worth to her ($80) but within Bob's budget and closer to his initial counteroffer.  Accepting at this point is a good compromise.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might walk away, and Bob would then have to buy from John for a higher price."
