"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discussed, the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a concession to get it into your hands. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above where I'd like to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $700,000. How about we try $825,000? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we try $800,000? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in going another round as you can buy from John for the same amount.  Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice changing her mind."
