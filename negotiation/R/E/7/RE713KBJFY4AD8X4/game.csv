"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discussed, the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a concession to get it into your hands. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but  $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above where I'd like to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $700,000. How about we try $825,000? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to come down to $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we try $800,000? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
