"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $20,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my target of $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm firm on $16,000.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16,000. I'm willing to meet you at $17,500, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,500 is still above my maximum budget of $15,000. While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely that the price will remain above my limit.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $15,000, as it guarantees I get the product within my budget."
