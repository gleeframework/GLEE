"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering my absolute minimum acceptable price.  There's no room for negotiation upwards from there, and it's not worth my time to continue. John offers a guaranteed $120, which meets my needs."
