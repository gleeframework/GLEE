"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'd be happy to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget constraints. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects both of our needs. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $925,000. Let's meet at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm committed to getting this product, but I need to stay within my financial constraints.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $890,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer.  This feels like a fair compromise that would allow us to both walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen.",890000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $890,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll meet you at $920,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",920000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget. If we can come to an agreement at $900,000, I'm happy to close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,10,
