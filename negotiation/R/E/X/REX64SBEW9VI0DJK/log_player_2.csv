Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $925,000 is still too high for my budget. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $825,000, or at least lower than $900,000 before considering buying from John."

Round 6

# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $925,000. Let's meet at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.

While Alice has come down to $900,000, which is her initial offer, it's still too high. We've already established that I'm willing to pay up to $875,000, so there's room for negotiation. I'm hopeful that we can reach a deal closer to my target price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm committed to getting this product, but I need to stay within my financial constraints.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $890,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer.  This feels like a fair compromise that would allow us to both walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 890000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $920,000 is still too high. It's only $10,000 less than her previous offer and we've been circling around the $875,000 - $900,000 range. I believe we can close the deal closer to that range.  I'm hoping to get a better price by making one more counteroffer, but if that fails, I'll likely buy from John."
