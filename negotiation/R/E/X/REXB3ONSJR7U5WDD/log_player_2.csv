"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I believe it's a great value for you, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is pretty close to my maximum, but I'll try to negotiate a better price.  There's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, as I'm confident in the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's counter is getting closer to a price I'd accept, I'm still willing to push a little further. I'm aiming to stay well below $100 if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product, Alice, and I'm definitely still interested. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to her value for the product.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is well within my acceptable range. There's no point in risking a worse deal by continuing to negotiate or going to John."
