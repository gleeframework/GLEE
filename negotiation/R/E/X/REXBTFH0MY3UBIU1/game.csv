"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm offering you the product for $1150000. This gives us both a good deal and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let me know if you're interested.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1150000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you $1100000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the offer of $1100000. However, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1125000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your decision.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
