"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1250000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm offering you the product for $1150000. This gives us both a good deal and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target price of $1,000,000.  There's still room for Alice to come down further, and Bob doesn't want to miss out on potentially getting a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the offer of $1100000. However, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1125000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  While there's a chance that further negotiation could bring the price down even further, there's also a risk that Alice might refuse to go lower.  Given that Bob can purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, it's a more secure and cost-effective option.  There's no guarantee that Bob can get a better price from Alice, and it's not worth the risk of potentially losing the product altogether."
