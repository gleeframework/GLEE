Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts with a reasonable markup, aiming for a good profit. It also emphasizes the value to Bob to incentivize him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I need to try and get closer to my desired price range. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and I believe it's fair. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation is becoming tiresome, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum price, but not exceeding it. While I could continue the negotiation, I risk wasting valuable time and potentially ending up with less than I could get from John.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees my desired minimum return."
