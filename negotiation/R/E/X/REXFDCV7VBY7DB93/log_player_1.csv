Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$9,000 is still a bit low, but I'm confident I can get a higher price.  I'm going to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a little, but $9,500 is still a fair price given the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,200 is close enough to my target and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept Bob's offer."
