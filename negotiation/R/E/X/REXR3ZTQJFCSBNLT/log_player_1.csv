{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to me, and Bob is offering $75. I can do better than that. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too low for $82.50. How about we try $78? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78

While $78 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $80, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $79.99? That's my absolute maximum for this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79.99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79.99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I've already reached my limit for counteroffers. I'm not sure if he'll accept my next counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's better to sell to John for $80, which is my minimum acceptable price."
