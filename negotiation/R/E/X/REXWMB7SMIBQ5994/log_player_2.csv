"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the price closer to Alice's perceived value. While it might be a bit too low, it leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about buying the product, but at a fair price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Alice is getting closer to her lowest acceptable price, but there's still room for negotiation. Offering a price around $11,000 might be a good next step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

``` 

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate further but also holds firm on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to consider $13,000, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

```

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice is signaling her bottom line:**  Her language (""lowest I can go"", ""fair price"") indicates she's unlikely to budge much further.
* **Significant savings:** We're still getting a $2,000 discount compared to John's price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Pushing further might make Alice walk away, leaving us to buy from John at a higher price."
