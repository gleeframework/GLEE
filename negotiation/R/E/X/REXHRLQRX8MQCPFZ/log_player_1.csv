Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. If he rejects, we can continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering with $125. This is still a good price for Bob considering his initial offer, and it's closer to my minimum price. This gives us a good chance to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to pay my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go lower.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I will sell to him."
