"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make me a serious offer on it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's, you might as well accept Alice's offer. It's the same price, but you might get a better deal if you negotiate with Alice in the future."
