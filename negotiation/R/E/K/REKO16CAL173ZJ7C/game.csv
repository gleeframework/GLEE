"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product is truly special, and I'm confident it will deliver significant value for your business. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,100,000. This reflects the value we both recognize in the product while allowing for a fair deal.
