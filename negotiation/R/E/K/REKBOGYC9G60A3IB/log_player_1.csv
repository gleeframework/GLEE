Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also sets a high initial value that demonstrates the product's worth.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value and is willing to pay a good price, but if not, I can always lower the price or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000, and I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a price that's still above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than I initially hoped for, it's above my minimum threshold of $10,000 and is a good compromise. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing a sale altogether, especially since John's offer is only $10,000."
