"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still more than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is close to Alice's minimum value of $12,000. This shows good faith in the negotiation and may encourage Alice to accept the offer.  It's also a significant reduction from the original $14,000, which is advantageous for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $15,000. There's still room for negotiation and Bob should continue to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, but it may be more appealing to Alice than the previous offer of $12,500. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach an agreement."
