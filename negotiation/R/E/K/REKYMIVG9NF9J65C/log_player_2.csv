{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $18,000 is way above your budget of $15,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($18,000) will put pressure on her to negotiate.  This gives us room to potentially reach a deal within our budget.  $13,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for potential compromise."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer of $16,500 is closer to our budget, it's still above our $15,000 limit. There's still potential to negotiate a lower price, especially since we have several rounds left. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows us to potentially get a better deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $16,000 is closer to our budget, it is still a bit high. We are only halfway through the negotiations, and there is still room to negotiate.  It is still better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems to be firm on her pricing, but we're making progress.

This keeps the negotiation moving and might convince Alice to come down a bit more."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is the closest to our budget yet, it's still higher than our maximum limit of $15,000. We have a few rounds left, and there's still potential to negotiate a lower price.  We can't afford to overspend right now."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $15,500 is still over our budget of $15,000. We have one round left, and it's worth pushing for a lower price.  This is our final chance to get a better deal before potentially having to buy from John."

Round 10

It's a fair compromise, and we're hoping Alice recognizes the value of closing the deal and accepts this offer. If she doesn't, we'll have no choice but to buy from John."
