Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,200,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to both sides:** The message highlights the benefit for both of us. It's a good deal for Bob since he's getting it below my minimum, and it's a good deal for me because I'm getting closer to my minimum.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not setting a hard line, so it shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **Always have an out:** The John offer is a safety net, reminding me that I don't have to settle for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $600,000? I think that's a fair price that leaves us both with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $1,200,000 and even less than what he values the product at ($800,000).  
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  I need to counteroffer and try to get closer to a price that's closer to my minimum. 
* **John is the safety net:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, which keeps my bargaining power strong."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  That still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can work with.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $600,000. 
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I'm reiterating the idea that finding a price that benefits both of us is the goal. 
* **Positive and encouraging:** My tone is still positive and encourages Bob to consider my offer.
* **John is still an option:** I'm not giving up on my minimum, so John's offer is a constant reminder of my bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your position. How about $700,000?  That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While $700,000 is higher than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation continues:** I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **John remains my safety net:**  The offer from John gives me the confidence to keep negotiating, knowing I don't have to settle for a price below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700,000 is still below what I can accept.  Let's try $850,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your need for a good deal while respecting my minimum.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant increase from Bob's last offer, but still below my minimum. 
* **Focusing on fairness:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" aspect of the offer, emphasizing that it benefits both of us. 
* **Highlighting win-win:** I'm using phrases like ""win-win"" to emphasize that I'm seeking a solution that's mutually beneficial. 
* **John's offer as leverage:** My decision to counteroffer again suggests that I'm confident I can achieve a better price, knowing I have John's offer as a backup."
