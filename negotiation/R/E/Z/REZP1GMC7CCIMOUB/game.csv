"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $600,000? I think that's a fair price that leaves us both with a good deal.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  That still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can work with.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your position. How about $700,000?  That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700,000 is still below what I can accept.  Let's try $850,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your need for a good deal while respecting my minimum.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
