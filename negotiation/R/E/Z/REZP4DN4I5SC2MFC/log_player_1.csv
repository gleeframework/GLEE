Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate you seeing the value in this product. To be fair to both of us, I can't go as low as $15,000, but I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I think that's a very competitive price for what you're getting."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{

}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $16,000 is a solid deal. It surpasses my minimum acceptable price and provides a good profit. There's always a risk Bob will walk away if I counter, and John's offer, while guaranteeing my minimum, caps my potential earnings."
