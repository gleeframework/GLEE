Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still leaving some room for negotiation with Bob.  If he rejects, I can consider his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup buyer in case negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with my own.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but it shows he's willing to negotiate. I'll try to get closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. It's still a good profit for me, and it shows I'm willing to be flexible while staying close to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,250 isn't my ideal price, it's getting very close to my goal of $10,000.  Further negotiation could go on for a long time, and I risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether. It's a good deal, and I'm going to accept it."
