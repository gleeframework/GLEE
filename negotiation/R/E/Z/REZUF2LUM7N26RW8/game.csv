"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile. I'm proposing $1050000. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1020000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession.  Let's split the difference and go with $1035000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1035000.0,Alice,5,
