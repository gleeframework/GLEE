# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fantastic deal for a product you won't regret owning. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,000.** This is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $11,500.
* **Buying from John costs $12,000.** Alice's offer is lower than John's price.
* **Bob wants to save as much money as possible.**  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to achieve this goal."
