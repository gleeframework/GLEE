"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're still interested, Bob. However, $9500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $13000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time!",13000.0,Alice,5,
