"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to be sure the price aligns with my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in similar deals. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal without sacrificing too much. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $1,080,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our mutual desire to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the bottom of the barrel. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,7,
