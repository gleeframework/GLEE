Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Aim High:** Starting with a price higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""true worth and potential,""  the message subtly justifies the high asking price.
* **Gauge Interest:**  Bob's response will indicate how much he truly values the product and whether he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000 if Bob declines."
