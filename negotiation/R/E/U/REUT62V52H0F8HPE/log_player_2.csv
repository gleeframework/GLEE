"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good deal, it's still above your target of $120. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you're willing to come down in price.  However, I'm really looking to spend closer to $105.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget:**  $110 is lower than your maximum price of $120.
* **It's a good compromise:**  You've successfully negotiated a lower price than Alice's initial offer. 
* **It's a better deal than John:**  Buying from Alice at $110 saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
