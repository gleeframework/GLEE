"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $12000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than the $15,000 from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  Offering $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire for a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $10,000 is still well above Alice's value of $8,000, indicating a potential zone for agreement.
* **Clear message:**  The message is concise and focuses on the price, keeping the conversation focused."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, we would like to counter with a price of $11000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $11,000 is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $15,000.
* **Progress Made:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds. 

At this point, accepting the offer secures a good deal with minimal risk."
