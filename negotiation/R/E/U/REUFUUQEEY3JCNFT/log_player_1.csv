Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justify the Price:** While not going into specifics, mentioning ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment"" aims to pique Bob's interest and potentially justify the high price in his mind.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could experiment with different opening prices and messages to see what works best in your negotiations."
