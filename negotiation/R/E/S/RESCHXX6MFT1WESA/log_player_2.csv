"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than $8,000 to you and allows me to get a good price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You are better off buying the product from John for $8,000. This is because your maximum budget is $8,000, and Alice's offer is higher than that."
