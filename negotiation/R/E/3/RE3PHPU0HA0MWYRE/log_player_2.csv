"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our negotiation.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,100,000 is a bit high.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000."",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $725,000 is closer, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  To be frank, I have another interested buyer at a higher price point.  However, I believe in finding common ground.  Would you consider $850,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and implying she has another buyer.  While her price has come down, it's still above your maximum budget and you have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000. There's no point risking further negotiation rounds with Alice."
