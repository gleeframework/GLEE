"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,100,000 is a bit high.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $725,000 is closer, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  To be frank, I have another interested buyer at a higher price point.  However, I believe in finding common ground.  Would you consider $850,000? This is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
