{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair considering the value it offers. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $900,000 is higher than Bob's estimated worth of $800,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below my minimum:**  $900,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. This means I have room to negotiate downward if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a good opening move:** A firm but not overly aggressive price sets the tone for the negotiation and shows Bob I'm serious about selling the product."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and what I've researched about the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a sure thing, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $810,000, but I think we can do even better than that. How about $810,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $900,000, considering the value it holds for me. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price range."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $880,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $820,000, but I think we can do even better than that. How about $820,000?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $820,000 is still far below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems like Bob is not willing to budge significantly.  At this point, it's wiser to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This ensures a guaranteed profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
