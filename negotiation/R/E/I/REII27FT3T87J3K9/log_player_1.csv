"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is serious about this product and how much he values it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that amount, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a good profit, but I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  This counteroffer shows that I'm open to negotiation, but I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still not a price I'm happy with.  I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can get a better deal. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm now willing to come down to my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John, which is not ideal, but it's better than selling for less than my minimum value."
