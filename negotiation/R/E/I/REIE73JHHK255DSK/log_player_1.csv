Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a fantastic opportunity for you.  Let me know if you're interested. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob a good deal and me a profit. 
* **Message:** I've emphasized the value of the product to me, highlighting the discount I'm offering. This adds pressure to Bob to accept. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit. By offering a price that is attractive to Bob, I increase the chances of him accepting. If he rejects, I still have a guaranteed sale to John for my minimum acceptable price."
