"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a good price given its potential value.  What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,000,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway at $1,700,000? This reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your investment.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,700,000 is still out of my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000 for the product, which is a significant price and still reflects the value I see in it. This offer is my final one, as I'm willing to buy from John for $1,200,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
