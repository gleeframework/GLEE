"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm confident that $1,100,000 represents a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal, I'm ready to move forward.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is your target price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
