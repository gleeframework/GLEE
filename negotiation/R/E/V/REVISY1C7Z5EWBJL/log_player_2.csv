{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your initial asking price is quite high. I'm interested in the product but need a more reasonable starting point. How about we begin negotiations at $600,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the true value of this product, let's meet in the middle at $1,800,000.

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the true capabilities and potential of this product.  To be candid, I have another offer in hand for a significantly higher amount. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I'd like to extend you a final offer of $1,400,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is coming down, but her latest offer is still far above your maximum price. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further.  While she mentions another offer, there's no guarantee it's real or that it will close. You have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the significant reduction.  However, to be transparent, my budget for this product is capped at $800,000.  If you're unable to meet that price, I understand, but I'm ready to finalize the deal at that figure if you're interested."",
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Transparency:** It's time to be upfront about your budget.  This prevents further back-and-forth without alienating Alice.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is your final offer, you're creating a sense of urgency and making it clear that you have an alternative (John).
* **Respectful:**  You're acknowledging her position and expressing understanding if she can't meet your price."
