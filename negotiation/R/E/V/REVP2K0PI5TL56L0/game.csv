"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
