Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for something worth $150 to me! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal ($20 below your minimum), but also leaves you room to potentially negotiate further if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I can afford right now. Would you consider $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $125 is above Bob's valuation, it is still below your minimum. You can aim for a higher price, and rejecting his offer gives you the opportunity to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is still below your ideal price, it's a good compromise. You're already close to your minimum, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit."
