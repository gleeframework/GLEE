"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item, I think it would really be valuable to you. I'm asking for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is asking for $115.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to do $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
