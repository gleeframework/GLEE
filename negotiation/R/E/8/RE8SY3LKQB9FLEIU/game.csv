"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm happy to negotiate, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $130? That way we both get a good deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $130. How about we meet at $127.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there at $127.50.  Let's try $129.  That's a good compromise, and we can close this deal.",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $128? I think that's the best I can do.",128.0,Bob,6,
