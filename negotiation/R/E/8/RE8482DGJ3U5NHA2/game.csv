"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price and I'm not going to go any higher.",10000.0,Bob,6,
