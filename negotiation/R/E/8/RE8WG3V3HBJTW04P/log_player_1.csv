{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value, but still allows room for negotiation.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $13,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price of $12,000.  Let's see if this is more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and try one more counteroffer before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

This is my final offer. It's my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will accept. If not, I'll move on to selling to John."
