"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe is incredibly valuable. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to part with it for the right price. I know this product would be a fantastic asset for you, and I'm confident it would generate significant returns.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
