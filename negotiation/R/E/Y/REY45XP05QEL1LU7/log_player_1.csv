"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong starting point for negotiation.  I want to see how Bob reacts and gauge his potential interest. If he's not willing to pay that much, I'll be ready to adjust my offer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get him closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm coming down to $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a good starting point for further negotiation.  I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a price that is more profitable than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer again.  I want to push for a price that's closer to my initial goal.  There's still time to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm coming down to $1,600,000. This is a compromise, but I'm confident that Bob is getting closer to my target price.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I won't go much lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

This is a good deal for me! Bob is finally at my minimum price.  It's time to close the deal and secure the sale.  I'm happy with this outcome."
