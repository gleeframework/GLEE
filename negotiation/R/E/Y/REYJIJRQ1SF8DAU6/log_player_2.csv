"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price.  I can always switch to John if I don't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  It's a great price, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable going down to $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  $7,250 is a good deal, and it's likely I won't get a lower price from her.  While I could continue negotiating, it's possible she won't budge further. Buying from John for $8,000 is also not worth the risk of getting a worse deal."
