"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend around $80 for this product.  Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me. This product is truly top-notch, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're confident in the product, but $130 is still outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this, but I can't go higher than $100.  Would you consider that?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $100 is pushing it. How about $115? That's my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $115 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you consider $105? I'm really interested in this product and I believe this price would be fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,6,
