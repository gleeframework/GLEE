"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. I believe this price reflects the value you would receive and also allows us to maintain a fair profit margin. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than John's price of $100, you can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. The product is only worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit high for me, given the product's value. I'd be willing to pay $85, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I would like to propose an offer of $90 for the product. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive in the market. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. The product is worth $80 to her, and $90 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer will hopefully lead to a better price for you."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $87.50. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
