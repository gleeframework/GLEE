"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking that $1400000 is a bit on the lower side considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1700000? I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we discuss a price of $1350000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $1350000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we discuss a price of $1600000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a reasonable compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the minimum price I'm willing to accept. How about we discuss a price of $1500000? I know this is the same price John is offering, but I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
