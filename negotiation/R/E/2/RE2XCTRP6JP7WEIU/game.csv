"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $9,000 is below my minimum, and I'm still confident this product is worth a lot to you.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll accept $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're not quite there yet.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm willing to compromise further if you're willing to meet me halfway. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to make one last adjustment to try to reach a deal.  I'll accept $10,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value I know you'll get out of it.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
