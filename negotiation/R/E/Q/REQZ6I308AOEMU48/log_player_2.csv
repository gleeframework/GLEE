Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $120. I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

``` 

While ideally getting the product for $120 would be best, Alice has consistently come down in price, and we are running out of rounds. Accepting at $130 ensures you get the product for less than your maximum price and avoids the risk of missing out entirely if you push too hard."
