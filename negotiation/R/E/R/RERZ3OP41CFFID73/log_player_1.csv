Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,000,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings to your operations justifies the cost.  Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is higher than my target price. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This price is fair considering the value you place on it, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I have 9 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price point that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows me to secure a price closer to my target. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. To reach a deal, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product for me while still being within my budget. I believe this is a fair offer that we can both agree on.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. $900,000 is a good price and it's within my target range. It's important to remember that I have a backup offer from John, but I'd rather close the deal with Bob. This allows me to maximize my profit and avoid the risk of losing the opportunity to sell to John if I keep pushing for a higher price."
