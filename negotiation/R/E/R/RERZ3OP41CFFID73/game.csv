"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is higher than my target price. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This price is fair considering the value you place on it, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price point that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows me to secure a price closer to my target. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. To reach a deal, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product for me while still being within my budget. I believe this is a fair offer that we can both agree on.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
