"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach my minimum price of $13,000. I'm counteroffering at $12,750. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12750.0,Alice,5,
