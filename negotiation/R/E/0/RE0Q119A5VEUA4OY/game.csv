"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make a significant move to close this deal quickly. How about $10,200? This is my final offer.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a significant move, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $9,500, which would be $9,850. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9850.0,Bob,6,
