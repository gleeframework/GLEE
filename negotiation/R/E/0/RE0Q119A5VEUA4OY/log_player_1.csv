Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a significant move, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $9,500, which would be $9,850. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price well below my minimum. He's unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk getting stuck with an even lower offer from Bob or missing out on a deal altogether."
