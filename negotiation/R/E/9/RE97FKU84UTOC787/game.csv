"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering your value for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering its true value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",11500.0,Bob,4,
