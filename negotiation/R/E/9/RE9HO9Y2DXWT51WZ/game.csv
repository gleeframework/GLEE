"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $950000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a balance between price and value, but I still believe the product's worth is higher than $950000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $1100000. This is the best I can do for now.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still outside my budget. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to offer $975000.  This shows my commitment to getting this product, but it's also a number that fits within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make concessions. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get at least $1200000. I'll offer it to you for $1050000 is too low, I'll offer it to you for $1150000. This is the lowest I can go.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to reach your minimum price, but $1150000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1025000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my serious interest. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's work together to find a solution.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1025000 is enough. I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll offer it to you for $1250000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising my minimum price.",1250000.0,Alice,9,
