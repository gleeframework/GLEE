"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal for Alice, it's still too high for Bob.  There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can send a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,000,000? It's still a good profit for you and closer to my target. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This is a significant drop and a good deal for Bob. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might walk away, or Bob could end up paying more by buying from John.  Accepting the offer at $1,100,000 saves Bob a considerable amount of money compared to John's price."
