Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You are still above your minimum selling price of $10,000, which ensures you don't lose money.

This strategy allows you to start the negotiation while keeping your options open. If Bob rejects, you can either counter-offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000 and even below his own perceived value of $8,000. Accepting his offer would be a huge loss for me.  I'm better off rejecting his offer and trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below my target and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $8,750? This price is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,200? I'm really close to my limit, and I'd love to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,200 is getting dangerously close to my minimum desired price, and I'm starting to feel like we are at an impasse.  I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price.  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $10,000, so it's the most logical and profitable decision to sell to him."
