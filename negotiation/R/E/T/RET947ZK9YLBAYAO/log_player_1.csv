Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield more profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you closer to your desired profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but the message frames it as a ""special price,"" potentially making it more appealing. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
