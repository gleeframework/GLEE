"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $9,500.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there at $9,000, but I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's see if we can find a meeting point."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not quite on the same page. While I appreciate your flexibility, I'm still not able to go below $9,250. This feels like a fair compromise, given the value you've expressed for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, even though it's not the lowest possible price. Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a lower price, and it could lead to a stalemate."
