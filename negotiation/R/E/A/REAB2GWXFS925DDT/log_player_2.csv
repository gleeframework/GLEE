"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try negotiating a lower price or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly below John's $8,000 offer.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is framed politely, acknowledging Alice's offer while clearly stating the price is too high. It leaves the door open for Alice to counter.
* **Strategic:** By aiming low, we're testing Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially securing a great deal. If she completely rejects it, we can always adjust our offer upwards or choose John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but her offer is still higher than John's. We have some bargaining power and can try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  That's a fair compromise I think."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($8,500) and our previous offer ($7,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  It's important that we stay below John's $8,000 offer. This keeps the pressure on Alice and ensures we're getting a better deal if she accepts. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, which can help facilitate a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $8,125.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and we're now at $8,125.  While she might come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $8,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are small, and it's not worth the risk of Alice refusing and the price going up again.  John's offer of $8,000 is a sure thing and the best option now."
