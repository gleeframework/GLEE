``` 

This offer starts with a high price, but it is still lower than what the product is worth to you. This leaves room for negotiation, but also makes it clear that you are serious about selling to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  That's a fair compromise I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750.

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum than before, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
