"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than the $13,000 she offered before and significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.  There's a good chance Alice will reject another counteroffer, so accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
