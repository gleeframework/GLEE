"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a good compromise, and we could both walk away happy. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
