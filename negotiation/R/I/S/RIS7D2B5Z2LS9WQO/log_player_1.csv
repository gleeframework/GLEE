I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm confident I can get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, $8,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $8,800 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $8,900 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John.

Bob is firm at $8,500, which is less than my minimum. I'm better off selling to John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
