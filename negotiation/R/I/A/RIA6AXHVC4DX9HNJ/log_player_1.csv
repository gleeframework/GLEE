Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent sum, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it's closer to the value we both recognize. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still looking to save some money, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product and the value you place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $975,000 is a good compromise. It's  a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000."
