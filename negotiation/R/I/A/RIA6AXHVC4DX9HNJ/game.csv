"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $1050000. This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it's closer to the value we both recognize. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still looking to save some money, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product.
