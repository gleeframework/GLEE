"I understand that $105 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go up to $125. How about we meet at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",130.0,Alice,5,
