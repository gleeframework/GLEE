Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is still fair considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's work out a deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly my maximum budget, and she has indicated it's her final offer.  There is no benefit to rejecting and trying to negotiate further since John is selling the product for the same price. Accepting Alice's offer allows me to finalize the purchase without any further negotiation."
