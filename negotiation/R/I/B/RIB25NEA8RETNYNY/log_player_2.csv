# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to make this transaction particularly attractive for you with a special offer of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below her own valuation, it's still more expensive than buying from John for $1,000,000. Your goal is to save money, and John offers the best price."
