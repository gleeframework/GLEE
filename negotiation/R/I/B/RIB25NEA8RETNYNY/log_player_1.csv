Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to make this transaction particularly attractive for you with a special offer of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as beneficial to Bob.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" I aim to encourage a quicker decision from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000:
    * Offers a significant saving to Bob compared to his perceived value ($150,000).
    * Leaves me with a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
