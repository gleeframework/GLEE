"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $10,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives me a chance to earn a fair price for my product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,9000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. How about we try $9,200? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9200.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  That's a substantial discount from my initial offer and still leaves you a great deal.  Let's close this deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $9,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,800 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,150.  This gives you a significant saving compared to my initial offer and is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,10000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,8,,
