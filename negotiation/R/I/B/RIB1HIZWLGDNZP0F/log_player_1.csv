Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think it would be a great deal for you!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still securing a profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a price below your minimum."
