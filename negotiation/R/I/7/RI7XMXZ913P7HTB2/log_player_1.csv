"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his budget might be.  If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of where to go next."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge at all, and a counteroffer will give me that information."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm offering $1,350,000. It's a compromise, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
