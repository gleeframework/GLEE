{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm happy to offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value but below your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially earn more, but it also ensures a quick sale if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your enthusiasm for the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm still confident this product is worth more to you than that. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $90. I'd be willing to meet you at $87.50. That's the highest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $87.5 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet. $87.50 is close, but it's still below my minimum.  How about we settle at $89?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 89}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $88. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $88 is getting close to my minimum, I'm getting tired of the negotiation. I've already rejected Bob's offer twice and I don't see much room for further negotiation. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to him."
