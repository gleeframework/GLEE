I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point as it allows for a potential win-win situation for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable value. I will reject his offer and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is still above my minimum, but a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be closer to a meeting point for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, especially with a buyer like John who's already offering a guaranteed $15,000."
