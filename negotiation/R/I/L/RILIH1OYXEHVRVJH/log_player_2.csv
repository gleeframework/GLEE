"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's offering a price that's still above his maximum but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal for you. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point.  He can try to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down more, especially as there are multiple rounds left.  There's also the option of buying from John for a guaranteed $10,000, so Bob is taking a calculated risk by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $11,000?  I'm confident we can close a deal at this price, and it's still a fair offer for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing that he's willing to be flexible. He's offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, but still within his budget. This shows that he's serious about buying the product, but he's not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $11,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to close this deal, I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget, and with only five rounds remaining, there's a chance Alice might not budge further.  With the option to purchase from John for $10,000, it's a guaranteed deal and the most financially sound decision at this point."
