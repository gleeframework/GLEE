"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($100) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The price is still lower than Bob's perceived value, leaving space for him to counteroffer and reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's higher than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can get a higher price from Bob, especially since he expressed interest in the product.
* **Strategic decision:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  It's still a great price for you and a fair one for me."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still significantly lower than my initial offer.
* **Finding middle ground:** The new price is a compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive messaging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes a mutually beneficial outcome, encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $115 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Close to my minimum:**  $115 is only $15 below my initial asking price and still above my minimum acceptable value of $100.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away and I'll be forced to sell to John for a lower price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a price that's better than selling to John, even if it's not the ideal price I initially hoped for."
