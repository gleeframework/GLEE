"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can likely do better by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $12,000? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $12,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still within Bob's budget of $15,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will refuse and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a higher cost."
