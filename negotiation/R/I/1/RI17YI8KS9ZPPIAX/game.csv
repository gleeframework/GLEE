"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's a fair price considering the product's value, and it would allow us both to make a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
