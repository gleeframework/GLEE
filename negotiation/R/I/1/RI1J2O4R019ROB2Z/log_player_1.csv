"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. It also signals to Bob that I believe the product is valuable."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.  While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
