"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  There's no reason to accept it at this stage. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can start negotiating and try to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is certainly appealing, but your initial price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a significant amount given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While it's closer, Bob can potentially save even more by continuing to negotiate.  There's no need to accept it yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $825,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is the maximum I can pay.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $815000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $815,000 is very close to Bob's maximum budget.  However, Bob has already stated his maximum price of $800,000.  It is unlikely that Alice will agree to go lower, and further negotiations could be time-consuming.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000. This guarantees a quick and satisfying transaction, aligning with Bob's objective of saving money and securing the product."
