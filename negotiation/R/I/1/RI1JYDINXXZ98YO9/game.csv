"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000. I'm looking forward to your response.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is certainly appealing, but your initial price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it, which is still a significant amount given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $825000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800000, which is the maximum I can pay.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $800000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $815000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to close the deal.",815000.0,Alice,5,
