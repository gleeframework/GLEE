Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. Based on my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if we can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to gauge his willingness to compromise."

This is a fair and reasonable offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product to you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
