"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I still have time to try and get a better deal with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering $100. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not getting a great deal. I'm going to reject this offer and try for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to try meeting Bob halfway by offering $95. This is still a good profit for me, and I think it might be a price Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $92 is a decent profit for me, and I'm running out of time to negotiate further. It's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will not make another counteroffer, leaving me with the option of selling to John for $120, which is only a $3 increase."
