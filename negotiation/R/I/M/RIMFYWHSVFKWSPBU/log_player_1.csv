Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Offering a price higher than $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above your minimum. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a dialogue. If Bob outright rejects this initial offer, you can then decide whether to negotiate further or move on to John. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy.  You could also start with a lower offer closer to $15,000 if you want a quicker sale, but you risk leaving money on the table if Bob would have been willing to pay more."
