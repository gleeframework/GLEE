"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but I'm thinking the price needs to come down a bit. How about we start at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway from our initial positions.  To be honest,  $1,150,000 is a little too high for me still. How about we settle at $1,075,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're proposing. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me in the middle.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm getting closer to being comfortable with the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
