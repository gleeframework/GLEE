"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is a significant investment, the true value of this product is much higher, as I'm sure you'd agree.  Could you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
