"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs.  I'm asking for $20,000,  given its value and potential. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This is a very fair offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Could you do $12,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,4,
