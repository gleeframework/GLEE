,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $105?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to avoid selling to John for less than I'd like.",100.0,Alice,5,
