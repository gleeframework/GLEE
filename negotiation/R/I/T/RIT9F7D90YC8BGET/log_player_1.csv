Round 2

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway?

# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your position, but I believe $11,500 is still too high for me. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product, which is closer to its value to me. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
