While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,255,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still provides a profit of $455,000, which is substantial. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Dragging out the negotiation further delays the receipt of the funds. The sooner the deal closes, the sooner the money can be put to work elsewhere.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Bob's offer is reasonable, and pushing too hard could make him walk away, leaving me to settle for John's lower offer."
