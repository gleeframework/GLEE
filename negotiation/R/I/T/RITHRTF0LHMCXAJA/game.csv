"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,035,000.  Let's make this happen.  ",1035000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,030,000 is still below my minimum. I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on this product. How about we split the difference and go with $1,032,500? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",1032500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,032,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,026,250. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this price.",1026250.0,Bob,8,
