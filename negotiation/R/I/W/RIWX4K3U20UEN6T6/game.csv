"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1500000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd need to see a lower price.  How about $1100000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1300000 is still a stretch for me. I'm ready to make a serious offer of $1150000. This reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
