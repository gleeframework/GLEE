"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have room to maneuver and 9 rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer of $700,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  This establishes a clear negotiating position and gives Alice room to counter without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my target price, I still have room to negotiate.  I'm rejecting the offer to see if I can get her to come down further. I still have 7 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a lower price. This is a good middle ground, and I think it will encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is closer to my target, I'm still confident I can negotiate a lower price.  I'm rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate.  I have 5 rounds left, and I'm determined to get the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $800,000. This is Alice's minimum acceptable price, and I believe she might be willing to accept it to close the deal. I'm strategically increasing my offer to signal that I'm serious about buying the product and to encourage Alice to accept. This leaves me with 4 rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, I'm running out of time (only 3 rounds left).  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and $815,000 is still within my budget and a good deal compared to buying from John.  It's time to close the deal."
