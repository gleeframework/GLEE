"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, starting with a price that is closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price. This shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a fair offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price. How about $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  The goal is to find a price that is closer to his desired range of $8,000-$8,500.  There's still room to bargain before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now showing a willingness to compromise, moving closer to Alice's desired price while still staying within his budget.  This counteroffer shows that he's serious about purchasing the product, but is also trying to secure the best possible deal.  By offering $9,000, Bob is  signaling that he's willing to negotiate further, but is not willing to go much higher."
