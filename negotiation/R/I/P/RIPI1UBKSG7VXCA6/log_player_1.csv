Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price. How about $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,000 is a good price for me, and it's better than selling to John. I'm happy to close the deal."
