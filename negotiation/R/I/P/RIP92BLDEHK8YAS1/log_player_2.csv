# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000, and I can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation for a relatively small potential saving."
