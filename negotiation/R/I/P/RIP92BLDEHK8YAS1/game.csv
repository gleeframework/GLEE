"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
