Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for me.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and optimistic, hoping to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  Knowing Bob's value, I've left room for him to make a counteroffer that I can potentially accept.

**Note:** This strategy is a balancing act. While I want to maximize profit, I also need to consider Bob's willingness to negotiate and the risk of him walking away.  If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000."
