"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a very unique and valuable product. I believe it holds tremendous potential for you, but I understand it's a significant investment.  My initial offer is $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
It's too early to sell to John. Bob is already engaged in the negotiation, and his offer is not so far off from the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $950,000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's not quite where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the value I believe the product holds for you, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering the negotiation thus far, I'd like to propose a price of $1100000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you, while keeping within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum. It's better to accept this offer rather than risk further rounds of negotiation. The chances of getting a higher offer from Bob are slim, and I don't want to risk losing him completely."
