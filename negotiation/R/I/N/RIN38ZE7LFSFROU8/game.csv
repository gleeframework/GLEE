,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $107.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $107.50 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $109, and we have a deal?",109.0,Alice,5,
