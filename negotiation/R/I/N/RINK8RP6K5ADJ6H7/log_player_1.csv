Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is reasonable and will likely lead to a successful transaction. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired $11,000. I'll counter with a price that reflects my valuation and leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $10,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my bottom line. This price is closer to what I want and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer of $9,500.  While this is a decent price, it's still not what I'm looking for, and I don't want to risk further negotiation only to have Bob reject it again. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. This guarantees me a profit and is the best outcome for me at this stage."
