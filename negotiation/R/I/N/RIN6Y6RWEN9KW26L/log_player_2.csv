# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me and the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still not willing to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.

* **Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.**  This means Bob can buy the product without exceeding his financial limit.
* **There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price.**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice backing out or John changing his offer.
* **Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at the best possible price within his budget.**"
