"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me and the value it will bring to you.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still not willing to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
