"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial price. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a lower price point. I'd be willing to go up to $1,125,000 for yours, as I do see the value in your offering. This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I believe my product is worth more than $1,125,000. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $1,175,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
