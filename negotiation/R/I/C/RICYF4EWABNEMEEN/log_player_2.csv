"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial price. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower before accepting her offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a lower price point. I'd be willing to go up to $1,125,000 for yours, as I do see the value in your offering. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, but I believe my product is worth more than $1,125,000. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $1,175,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,175,000, and it's her final offer.  At this point, John's offer of $1,200,000 is more appealing. It makes more financial sense to buy from John and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
