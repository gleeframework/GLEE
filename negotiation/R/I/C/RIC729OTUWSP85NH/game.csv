"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I recognize its value, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
