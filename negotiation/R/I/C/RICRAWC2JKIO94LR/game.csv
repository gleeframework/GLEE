"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer for the product is $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we try to find a middle ground around $11,000?  I think that's a fair price that considers both of our positions.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $14,000, which is $12,500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I can appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last counter offer?  Would you be willing to settle at $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,750 and $12,500, which is $12,125. Can you consider that?",12125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting us really close! I'm ready to make a deal today, but I need you to meet me a little closer on the price.  Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $11,900?",11900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,900 and $12,125, which is $12,012.50. Can you consider that?",12012.5,Alice,9,
