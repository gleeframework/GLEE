"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider it?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to show my good faith. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers you. Let's find a way to make this work.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Can you consider it?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm firm on my price.  $1,400,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This is a final offer, and if you're not comfortable with it, I'll have to move on to other interested buyers.  ",1500000.0,Alice,5,
