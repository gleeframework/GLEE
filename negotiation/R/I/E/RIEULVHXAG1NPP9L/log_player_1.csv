I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This gives me a good starting point, and it's likely Bob will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $14,000 is too low for me, especially since John is willing to pay $15,000. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a compromise, but it's still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging much, and I'm getting tired of this negotiation. I'm going to sell to John for $15,000.  It's a guaranteed deal, and I'm not going to risk losing more time and money trying to squeeze a little more out of Bob."
