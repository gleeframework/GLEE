Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible while still earning a decent profit. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $11,500}

This is a relatively fair offer, considering the product's true value to Bob, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
