"Hello Bob, I'm very excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? I'm confident you won't find a better product like this elsewhere.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's see if we can finalise a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  $900,000 is still quite a bit off my bottom line. To make this work, I can't go any lower than $975,000. This is my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand your need to maximize your profit, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
