"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can we meet in the middle at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1500000, which would be $1350000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to try to find a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so my counteroffer is $1275000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1275000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. Let's try meeting in the middle between $1275000 and $1500000, which would be $1387500. What do you think?",1387500.0,Alice,5,
