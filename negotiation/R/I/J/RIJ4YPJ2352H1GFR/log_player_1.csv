"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it still allows for a healthy profit. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is more than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I need.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for coming down to $11,000. I would like to counteroffer at $10,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I have a few rounds left and believe I can still get a better deal. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $10,500 is still not quite there. How about $10,800?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good investment for you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $10,600 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value to me and would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,600 is tempting, I still believe there is room for a slightly higher offer from Bob.  I have a few more rounds, so I'll keep trying to see if I can get a better deal. If he doesn't budge, I'll switch to selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I understand your position, but I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $10,700? This would be a good compromise for both of us. Let's finish this deal. "", ""product_price"": 10700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $10,650 for the product. I believe this price is reasonable and reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to my bottom line. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. There is a chance he will come back with a higher offer, but I don't want to risk it. It's better to sell to John at $15,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
