"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth its weight in gold.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay $1,100,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $1,200,000, especially since Bob has already shown interest.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  I'm confident this price is still a great value for you considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the item while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is close enough to my desired price point that it's worth accepting.  While I could potentially continue to negotiate and try to squeeze out another $25,000, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether. At this point, it's better to secure a good price rather than risk getting nothing."
