"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $100, so you're leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You won't accept anything less than $120, but this gives you room to lower the price if needed.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in your product's value but are willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I would like to counter with a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120. While you could accept and close the deal quickly, it would leave you with a suboptimal profit.  It's better to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. How about $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have more rounds to negotiate and a guaranteed sale to John at $120, making it worthwhile to continue pushing for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference â€“ $110 for the product.  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of drastically lowering your price again, you're proposing a middle ground.
* **Maintain your position:**  You're still above your minimum and leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on a win-win:** You're emphasizing that this deal is beneficial for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. I would like to propose $107 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. With John offering you a guaranteed $120, it's still worth pushing for a higher price. You have four rounds left, and you could potentially close the deal with Bob at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $112. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight concession:** You're showing flexibility by lowering your price, but only by a small amount. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** You're framing the offer as a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Closing pressure:** You're implying that this could be your final offer, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $112 is still slightly above what I'm willing to pay. Would $110 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a difficult decision.  While Bob's offer is still below your ideal price, you're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. 

Here's why accepting is the best choice:

* **Time is running out:** You only have 2 rounds left. If you reject this offer, you risk ending up with John's $120, which is your minimum.
* **Closing the deal:** Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a profit, albeit a smaller one than you hoped for.
* **Potential for a better deal is low:** You've already lowered your price significantly.  There's a good chance Bob won't go any higher.

While you'd prefer more money, it's better to secure a sale now than risk losing out on any profit."
