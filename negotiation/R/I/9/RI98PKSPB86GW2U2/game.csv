"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the value to me and the market price, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and the market rate.  Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,
