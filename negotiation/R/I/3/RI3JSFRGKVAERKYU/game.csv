"I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its features and quality.",14000.0,Bob,4,
