"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,200,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still allows me to make a good return on my investment while giving you a fair price.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and our previous discussions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,250,000 is still a little low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $1,275,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement here.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I see we're getting closer! I'm willing to go down to $1,260,000. That's a significant concession from my original position, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If you're willing to close the deal at this price, we can move forward.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",1260000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,230,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer $1,240,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1240000.0,Alice,9,
