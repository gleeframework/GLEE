Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Gauging Bob's interest:**  A high initial offer helps you understand how badly Bob wants the product. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can always come down closer to John's price. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line, encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer."
