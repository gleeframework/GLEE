{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's worth a lot more than that to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $11,500 is above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're giving Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting at the lowest price, showing that you believe in your product's value.

Remember, you can always adjust your counteroffers based on Bob's responses and your knowledge of his value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is a decent price, it's still below what I consider to be the product's true value.  I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my original asking price before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. While $11,000 is better, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $10,750?  It's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's clear he's not going to go higher.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and risk losing the deal."
