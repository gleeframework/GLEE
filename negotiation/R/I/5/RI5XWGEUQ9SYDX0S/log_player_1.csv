Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This is his maximum willingness to pay.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA to maximize your profit. However, you need to leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal so he doesn't walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" helps justify the high price without directly revealing your bottom line.
* **Confident Tone:** Using phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""fair offer"" project confidence in your pricing. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer.  Have a negotiation strategy ready, knowing your walk-away point is $1,200,000.
* **Don't Reveal John:**  Bob doesn't need to know about your backup buyer.
