"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, there's no incentive to accept it immediately.  Bob has the opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a better price. By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps his options open and avoids paying the full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This bold move aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially set the stage for a successful bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more measured approach this time. He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to his target. This strategy aims to create a sense of momentum toward a deal without risking Alice rejecting the offer outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $11,000.  This is a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $15,000. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while saving $3,500 compared to buying from John. There is a good chance that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice will not be willing to go lower, and Bob risks losing out on the deal."
