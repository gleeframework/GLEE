"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value, but I believe I can't justify spending $1,500,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price? I am willing to pay up to $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the product's value, I still feel that $1,450,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
