"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. My initial offer is $1,100,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I also have to consider my own needs and make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $800,000. Let's aim for a compromise. My counteroffer is $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this product, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you a price of $920,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,
