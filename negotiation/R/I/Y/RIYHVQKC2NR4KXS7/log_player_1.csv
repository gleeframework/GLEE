{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still not getting close to my minimum value of $150.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $100.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? That would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget, I believe we could reach an agreement closer to $95. This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  It's not worth risking further negotiation to potentially get even less.  Selling to John for $150 is the best option at this point."
