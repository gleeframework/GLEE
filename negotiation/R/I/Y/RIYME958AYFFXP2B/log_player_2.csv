{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've been negotiating with Alice for several rounds now, and she seems unwilling to budge much further. It's getting close to the end of your time limit, and you're only a few hundred dollars away from your max budget.  With only one round left, the risk of not getting a deal with Alice is too high.  You're better off buying the product from John, as you're guaranteed to get it within your budget."
