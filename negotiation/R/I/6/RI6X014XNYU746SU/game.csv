"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is much higher than that.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit, but $16,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we try $11,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a good price considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need the price to be closer to my budget.  I can do $12,000, but that's really pushing it for me.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but that's the lowest I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is much higher than that.",13500.0,Alice,7,
