"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it to you at $1,500,000. I know this is a premium over your stated valuation, but I believe the true value of this product will become clear as we discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  Beginning with a price of $1,500,000 gives us room to negotiate downwards. While this is above Bob's stated value, it's important to remember that valuations are subjective and can be influenced. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the high price (""true value..."") provides a talking point and avoids making Bob feel like we're just randomly throwing out numbers.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While we always have the John backup, aiming for a higher price with Bob is the priority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. I believe that's a fair starting point that reflects its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our valuation and his own stated value. Accepting this would be a substantial loss.  We have plenty of room to negotiate and the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate your perspective, but $800,000 is considerably below what I can consider.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We're dropping the price by $150,000, a substantial amount that shows we're willing to negotiate. However, we're still significantly above both Bob's offer and his stated valuation.
* **Anchoring:** By making a significant first move down, we're attempting to ""anchor"" the negotiations closer to our desired range.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the ""true value"" argument,  subtly implying that Bob might be undervaluing the product. 
* **Maintaining Margin for Negotiation:**  We still have room to make further concessions if needed while staying above our walk-away point (John's $1,200,000 offer)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground.  $1,350,000 is still a significant jump from my initial offer. To show I'm serious, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, $900,000 is still well below our minimum acceptable price.  We're making progress, but we need to see more substantial movement from him to justify accepting. We're willing to continue negotiating for now, using John's offer as our safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving up on price. It shows you're serious. However, there's still a substantial gap between our positions.  To bridge this, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our price by $75,000, a smaller amount than before. This signals that we're getting closer to our bottom line and won't be making large jumps.
* **Nearing the Walk-Away:**  $1,275,000 is getting very close to John's offer.  We need to apply pressure and see if Bob is willing to make a significant move.
* **Emphasize Seriousness:**  Reiterating our desire to close the deal helps maintain a positive tone while still firmly negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. While $1,275,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my budget.  Let's make this simple â€“ I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This represents my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a very fair offer given the market and the value this product holds for me. Let me know if you're agreeable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial point in the negotiation. Bob has reached his stated valuation of $1,000,000 and is presenting it as his ""absolute maximum."" While this is a tempting offer, we have a few factors to consider:

* **John's Offer:** We have a standing offer from John for $1,200,000, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.
* **Potential for More:** Bob using phrases like ""absolute maximum"" could be a negotiation tactic. There might be some wiggle room, and we have four rounds left to explore that.
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk that Bob walks away if we push further, but there's also a chance he's anchoring and willing to go slightly higher. 

**Strategy:** We'll reject Bob's offer but signal that we're very close to accepting. This will require a careful balance of pressure and understanding to nudge Bob towards a better final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position and appreciate you coming up to $1,000,000.  I've been very flexible throughout this process to get a deal done. To be entirely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000 that I need to consider. However, I value the discussions we've had and would much rather work with you. If you're able to move up slightly, I'm confident we can close this today."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Pressure:** We're revealing John's offer without explicitly saying we'll take it. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob while showing him we're not bluffing about our alternatives.
* **Slight Movement (Matching John):** We're matching John's offer, signaling this is our true bottom line. It subtly encourages Bob to beat John's offer if he's truly invested.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** We're emphasizing our preference for working with Bob, preserving the relationship even as we apply pressure. 
* **Call to Action:**  We're ending with a clear statement indicating our desire to close the deal *today*, prompting Bob to make a decision."
