"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for potential negotiation."
