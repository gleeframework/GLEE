Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Offering it slightly below his valuation ($1,100,000) maximizes the potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a strong offer can often lead to a quicker and more favorable outcome.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 gives you leverage. Offering the product to Bob at $1,100,000 leaves a significant margin for negotiation if needed while still aiming high."
