Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure it's worth $2000000 to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel that the price is more reasonable. I'll start by offering $1400000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was $1,400,000, and my previous counteroffer was $1,800,000, I'll make a new counteroffer that's closer to Bob's initial offer, but still higher than his last offer. This will give me some room to negotiate further.

{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. While $1600000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $1400000 again. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
