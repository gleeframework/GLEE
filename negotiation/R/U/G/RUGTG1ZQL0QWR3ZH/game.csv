I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product's exceptional features and benefits.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure it's worth $2000000 to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel that the price is more reasonable. I'll start by offering $1400000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and make a counteroffer of $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. While $1600000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $1400000 again. Can you consider this revised offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to let you know that I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1500000 for the product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1600000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're interested.",1600000.0,Alice,5,,
