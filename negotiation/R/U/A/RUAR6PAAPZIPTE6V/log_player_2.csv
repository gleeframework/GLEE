"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique and valuable asset that can bring significant benefits to your business or personal life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a better deal. It saves you $200,000. Even though Alice values the product at $1,200,000, her offer still allows you to save money compared to buying from John."
