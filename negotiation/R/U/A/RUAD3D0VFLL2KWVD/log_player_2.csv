"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 seems a bit high for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a better deal.
* **Respectful Tone:** I want to maintain a positive and respectful tone to encourage Alice to continue negotiating.
* **Target Price:** My goal is to get the product for as close to $80 as possible, but I'm willing to pay more for the convenience of securing the deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120. It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning:

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice claiming this is her final offer is likely a negotiation tactic. I'm willing to call her bluff and see if she's willing to negotiate further. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a significant gap between her offer ($120) and my target price (closer to $80).
* **John as Backup:**  I still have the option to buy from John for $150, so I'm not desperate to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That seems like a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $110, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and move closer to her price.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she rejects this, I'll know I need to move closer to $120 or consider buying from John.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, so I'm increasing my offer to try and secure a deal sooner rather than later."
