"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $900,000 is closer to your maximum budget than it is to Alice's valuation. 
* **You have leverage:** You know John will sell you the product for $1,000,000. This gives you a fallback option and room to negotiate.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless she comes down in price. This increases your chances of getting a better deal, potentially closer to $850,000 or even less."
