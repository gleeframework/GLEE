Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you closer to your maximum. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While aiming high, the price isn't ridiculously above Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll consider the offer. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk and potential reward effectively."
