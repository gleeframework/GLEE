"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,075,000 is closer, but I need to see a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. How about we settle at $1,110,000? This is my final offer.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go above $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to pay. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
