Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($1,100,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob. It's significantly more than his perceived value ($800,000), but the potential for profit might entice him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial high price also leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially reaching a price that's still very beneficial for you. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
