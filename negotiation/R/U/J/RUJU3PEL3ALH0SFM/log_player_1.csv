Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand you're looking for a more competitive price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is too low, I could be persuaded to let it go for $1,350,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable price. What do you say?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to move on the price. I appreciate that. To be frank, $1,350,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to meeting closer to the middle at $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're definitely a tough negotiator! I respect that.  While $1,125,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a touch lower than I can comfortably go.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,237,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle this right now at $1,180,000?  That's a strong offer and would allow us to wrap things up today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we're reaching a point of diminishing returns.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob not reaching a satisfactory price in the remaining rounds."
