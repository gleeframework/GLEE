"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand you're looking for a more competitive price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is too low, I could be persuaded to let it go for $1,350,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable price. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to move on the price. I appreciate that. To be frank, $1,350,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to meeting closer to the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're definitely a tough negotiator! I respect that.  While $1,125,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a touch lower than I can comfortably go.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,237,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1237500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle this right now at $1,180,000?  That's a strong offer and would allow us to wrap things up today.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
