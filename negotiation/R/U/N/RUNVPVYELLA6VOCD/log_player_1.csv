Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at it by mentioning ""its value."" This subtly implies that the offered price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion (""What are your thoughts?"") This invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation alive.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice has some leverage and that the product isn't readily available elsewhere.
* Bob's personality and negotiation style are unknown. A more aggressive approach might backfire."
