"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in great condition and worth every penny. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  Let's meet in the middle.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $145. Let's see if we can agree on that.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $145 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  Let's split the difference and go with $152.50.  It's a fair price for both of us.",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating. While I appreciate your offer, $152.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is your minimum, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",150.0,Bob,6,
