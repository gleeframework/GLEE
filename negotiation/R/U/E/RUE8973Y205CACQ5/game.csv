"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford $100 right now.  Would you be willing to negotiate?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for 100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for 130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still too high for me. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than 125. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really benefit from it. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at 125.",125.0,Alice,5,
