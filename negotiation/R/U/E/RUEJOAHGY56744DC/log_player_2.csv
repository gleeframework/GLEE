Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $18,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his limit."

```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. At this point, it's clear that further negotiation with Alice will likely not result in a price that Bob is comfortable with.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at a price he can afford."
