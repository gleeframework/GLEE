"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Given the product's value to me, I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,000, but I'm not going any lower than that.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find some middle ground here.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $12,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $16,000, and that's as low as I can go.",16000.0,Alice,5,
