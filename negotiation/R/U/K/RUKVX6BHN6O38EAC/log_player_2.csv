"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a fallback option (buying from John), there's no reason to accept Alice's first offer. By rejecting, you open the possibility of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and sets a strong starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $850,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of going too low and losing the deal outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price. It's time to secure a good deal."
