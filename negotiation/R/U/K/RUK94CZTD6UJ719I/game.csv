"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, I know the true worth of this product is considerably higher than your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the product's value fairly.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
