"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? It's still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to me.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $12,750 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
