Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is still below my minimum price, and I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we settle on $1,300,000? This would still give you a significant discount and a great deal for the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,250,000. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a higher figure. I'm not quite at the point where I'd sell to John, as there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 still leaves me a bit short. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? It's a good compromise, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up slightly.  How about $1,260,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, I've been negotiating for a while and we're getting close.  At this point, accepting Bob's offer is the best option to avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John."
