"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we settle on $1,300,000? This would still give you a significant discount and a great deal for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,250,000. Would that be feasible?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 still leaves me a bit short. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? It's a good compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
