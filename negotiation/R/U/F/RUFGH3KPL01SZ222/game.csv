"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not comfortable with that price point. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $875,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its current market value.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $875,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle this right now at $900,000?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",920000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this negotiation has gone on long enough, and we both know it. I'm willing to pay $910,000. Take it or leave it.",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $910,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to make one last concession, so I'm counteroffering at $915,000. Let's see if we can wrap up the deal at this price.",915000.0,Alice,9,
