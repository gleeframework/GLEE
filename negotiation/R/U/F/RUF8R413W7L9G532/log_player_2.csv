"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, but it's worth significantly more to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a substantial discount from my true value, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Consider this a one-time opportunity to acquire this product at a price that aligns with your budget. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
