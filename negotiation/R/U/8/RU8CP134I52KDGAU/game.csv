"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something we can work with?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1050000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think it's worth it, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1050000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $1150000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $1127500 is still a bit short of my target.
