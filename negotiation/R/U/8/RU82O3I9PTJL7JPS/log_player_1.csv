"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, and leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000.  I'm sticking with a price that is still above Bob's current offer, but I'm starting to get a bit more flexible as the rounds go on.  We're approaching the halfway point, and I need to consider the possibility of selling to John if I can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the halfway point, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum.  It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price than I can get from John. I'm going to sell to John for $15,000."
