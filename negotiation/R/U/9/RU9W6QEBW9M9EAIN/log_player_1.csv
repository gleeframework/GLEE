"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than $100 since the product is worth $150 to him. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's more than what John is offering, it's still below my target.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly to $135. This is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $150 to him. It also shows him that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping this will lead to a quicker resolution without needing to go through many more rounds."
