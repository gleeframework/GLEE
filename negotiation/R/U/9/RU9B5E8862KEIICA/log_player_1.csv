"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $100, knowing that I'm willing to go lower. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiastic Message:**  A positive message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not being overly aggressive by demanding $100 right away. Instead, I'm inviting Bob to counter-offer, which will give me a better idea of his perceived value of the product."
