"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8000 for this item. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $11000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $12000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $10500? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11500? It's the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $11250. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",11250.0,Alice,9,
