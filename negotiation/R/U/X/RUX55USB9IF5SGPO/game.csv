"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a lower price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
