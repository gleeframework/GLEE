Explanation:
Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000. However, we know Alice values the product at $800,000.  This suggests Alice is willing to accept a lower price. By rejecting this offer, we may be able to negotiate a better price with Alice, closer to her valuation.
