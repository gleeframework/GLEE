"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's value. While I'm very interested, $850000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $750000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $800000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
