"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price ($1,200,000). This is a good starting point for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's value. While I'm very interested, $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.  However, it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
* **Focus on value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to you, aligning with Alice's framing of the deal.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, leaving room for continued discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $750000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $800000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** Alice has come down to $800,000, which is a significant discount from her initial offer and well within your budget.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While you could try for a lower price, it's likely Alice will stick to this point.  Accepting her offer saves time and guarantees you get the product at a good price.
* **Avoiding Jhon:**  Buying from Jhon would cost you $400,000 more.  This offer from Alice is a much better value."
