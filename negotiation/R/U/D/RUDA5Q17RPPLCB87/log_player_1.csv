"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, emphasizing the value and opportunity.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $15,000 gives room for negotiation, as I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** Bob's counteroffer is within a reasonable range, but I'm not in a rush to accept just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price.
* **Room for Improvement:** $14,000 is still a good deal for me, but I'd like to see if I can push it a little higher.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting the offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and see how far he's willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  It's a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Compromise:** I'm making a small compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility without immediately going to Bob's price.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing fairness and compromise to build trust and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Incentivize Agreement:** I'm highlighting the win-win situation, reminding Bob of the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
