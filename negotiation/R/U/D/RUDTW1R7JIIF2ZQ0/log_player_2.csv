This product holds tremendous potential and is valued at no less than $1500000 to me.  However, I'm willing to negotiate a price that benefits both of us. I'm offering it to you for $2000000.  This price reflects the inherent value and potential of this product.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's better to reject the offer and buy from John at the lower price."
