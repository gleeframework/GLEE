"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering its value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $500,000 is unfortunately too low. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,3,
