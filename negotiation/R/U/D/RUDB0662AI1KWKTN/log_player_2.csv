"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my maximum budget and what John offers. I should try to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $500,000 is unfortunately too low. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer now matches John's price, which is my maximum budget. There's no point in further negotiation or going with John since the price will be the same."
