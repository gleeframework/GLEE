Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. We have four rounds left, and it's likely he'll come up further knowing he's close to your guaranteed sale price with John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but it's still a substantial difference from what I had in mind. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair and final offer, reflecting the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're moving closer to both John's offer and a potential agreement with Bob.  By firmly stating this is our final offer, we increase the pressure on Bob to either accept or significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer in the remaining two rounds. He's sticking close to his previous offer, indicating he's reached his limit. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a guaranteed $50,000 profit from John.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
