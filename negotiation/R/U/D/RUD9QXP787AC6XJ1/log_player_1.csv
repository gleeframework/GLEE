Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to someone like you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, giving us significant room to negotiate above our minimum price of $80.
* **Target Price:** Aiming for a price around $120 seems like a reasonable starting point. It offers Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value while securing a substantial profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $80 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the $120 offer, you're not losing out completely.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
