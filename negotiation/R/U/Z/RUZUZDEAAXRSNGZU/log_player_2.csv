Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $650,000. It falls considerably below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  While $725,000 is closer, it's still below the value I need to realize.  Let's try $850,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your persistence.  However, $760,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $805,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous offers.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $805,000.

Alice is very stubbornly holding above your maximum price. It's unlikely she'll go below $800,000 in the remaining rounds, so it's best to take John's offer and secure the product at your target price."
