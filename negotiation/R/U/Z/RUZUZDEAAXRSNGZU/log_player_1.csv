"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product at a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it offers. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a higher price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing Bob with a justification for the price. While this is not required, it can help establish a foundation for the negotiation.
* **Openness:**  I'm using language that invites Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to accept $650,000 given the potential for the negotiation to fall apart, I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting his offer and continuing the negotiation.  I believe I can still get a better price by counteroffering and potentially closing the deal at a value closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $650,000. It falls considerably below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Flexible:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer, demonstrating I'm not desperate for a quick sale. However, I'm also signaling willingness to negotiate by making a counteroffer.
* **Realistic Compromise:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is still well above Bob's initial offer but lower than my starting point. This shows I'm open to finding a middle ground.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and justifying my counteroffer by emphasizing the compromise I'm making."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds significant value, and I am committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $725,000 is closer to my desired price range, it still falls below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm confident that I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  The fact that Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and acknowledging the value of the product gives me reason to believe a mutually agreeable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  While $725,000 is closer, it's still below the value I need to realize.  Let's try $850,000.  This is a significant step towards your position, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Persistence:** I'm again rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by narrowing the gap.  I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product.
* **Focused Messaging:** I'm highlighting the fact that my counteroffer is a ""significant step towards"" Bob's position, further emphasizing my willingness to compromise.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The open-ended question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to continue the dialogue and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $760,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while recognizing my financial limits.  Let's close this deal, what do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it still falls short. I'm determined to get a price closer to $1,000,000.  He's showing interest and willingness to negotiate, which gives me hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your persistence.  However, $760,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $805,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous offers.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 805000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain Momentum:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and his desire to close the deal, but I'm not accepting it. 
* **""Halfway"" Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the compromise by proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's current offer.  This strengthens my position and makes it harder for Bob to reject without appearing unreasonable.
* **Focus on Closure:**  I'm using phrases like ""let's close this deal"" and ""move forward"" to encourage Bob to accept and end the negotiation."
