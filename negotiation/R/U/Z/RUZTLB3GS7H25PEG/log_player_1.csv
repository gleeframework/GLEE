Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without trying to negotiate down too much.

**Important:** It's crucial to strike a balance between a high asking price and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and going with your guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000."
