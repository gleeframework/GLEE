"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $825000, which is a significant discount from my original price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000, which is a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I can meet you halfway between $825000 and $750000, which would be $787500. What do you think?",787500.0,Alice,5,
