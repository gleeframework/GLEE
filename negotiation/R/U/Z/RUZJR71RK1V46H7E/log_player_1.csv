Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000 is a good starting point.** It's a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and positive.** This sets a good tone for the negotiation and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **This offer leaves room for negotiation.** If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I'll still be able to make a profit.

**Important considerations:**

* I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so I don't want to be too aggressive with Bob. 
* I want to ensure a successful negotiation.  This strategy is aimed at finding a mutually agreeable price, which is more likely to lead to a deal than a hard-line approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my goal. I'm confident I can get a better price, but I also don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $900,000.  This will show him I'm willing to compromise but also still value my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference? I'll accept $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that gives us both something to gain."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with $875,000:** This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.  It's still above his offer, but significantly lower than my initial offer.
* **Positive and friendly message:**  I maintain a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Highlighting mutual gain:**  I emphasize that this offer benefits both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Reasoning:**

I believe this counteroffer is a good strategy for a few reasons:

* **Balancing risk and reward:** It's a risk to reject Bob's offer completely, as he may walk away.  However, accepting his offer is too low for my desired profit margin.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** By offering a compromise, I subtly suggest that this might be my final offer.
* **Setting a clear price point:**  The $875,000 price point leaves some room for further negotiation but is also a solid target for me.

I'm confident that this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation and bring me closer to my goal of earning as much as possible for the product."
