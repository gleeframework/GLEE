"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a competitive price, and I get a quick sale.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
