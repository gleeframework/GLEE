"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000.  This is a great opportunity for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,1,
