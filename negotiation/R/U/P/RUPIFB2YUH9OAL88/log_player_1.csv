Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,750,000? I'm confident this price reflects the immense potential this product holds."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could potentially go up to $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a reasonable deal, but we're not there yet. Bob is willing to go above his initial valuation, showing there's room for negotiation. We still have time and should aim for a price closer to $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, how about $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. We are getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, but we still have some negotiating room. It's worth seeing if we can get closer to $1,450,000 before considering accepting or going to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your commitment to this deal is clear. Let's finalize this â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a very competitive price considering the product's unique value proposition."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're in the home stretch now. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,400,000.  This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has signaled this is his final offer and it's a reasonable compromise. Accepting secures a $1,400,000 deal, which is a significant profit.  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving us with the $1,500,000 offer from John, which is only slightly better."
