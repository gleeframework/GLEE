"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $18,000 is a fair starting point, I believe the true value of this product is reflected closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to meet halfway at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $17,500, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $17,500 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept. How about we settle at $18,500 and call it a deal?",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $18,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17,500 and $18,500, which would be $18,000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",18000.0,Bob,6,
