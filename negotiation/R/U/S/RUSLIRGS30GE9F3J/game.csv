,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the price of $950,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I can offer you a final price of $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
