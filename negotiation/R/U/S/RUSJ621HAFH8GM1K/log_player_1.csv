Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher price.  I'm confident that Bob will find this offer attractive, but if he rejects, I'm ready to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price,  hoping to secure a deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, as it's closer to my initial asking price but still represents a good deal for Bob. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, and although it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation. I don't want to risk losing Bob completely and ending up with the lower price from John."
