Let's start by making a significant counteroffer.  $800,000 is a substantial discount, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate while still saving us a lot of money."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to budge. Accepting her offer guarantees a good deal and saves further negotiation time."
