# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go that low without some more negotiation. I'll meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $14,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While there's a chance that further negotiation might get Alice down to $12,000, it's risky to continue, given the limited rounds remaining.  It's better for Bob to secure the product at John's guaranteed price of $12,000."
