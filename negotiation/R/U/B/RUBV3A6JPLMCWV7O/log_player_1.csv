Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $120.  This is a good starting point for the negotiation, as it shows I'm open to a deal, but it also gives me some room to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $95? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering $95, which is a compromise, but still a profit for me. It's worth testing if Bob is willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50? That's the most I can stretch my budget to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$92.5 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and is a good profit for me.  Bob is clearly committed to buying the product and is willing to pay a decent amount.  I'd rather sell to Bob at $92.5 than go through more rounds of negotiation or sell to John for $120."
