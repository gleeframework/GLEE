"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting high, at $1,500,000, as I want to maximize my potential profit. This will allow me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I'll always keep in mind the $1,000,000 offer from John as my floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still much lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I want to see if there's more room for negotiation before settling for that price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round, but still higher than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000, which is still a decent profit for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still keeping my target price above the $1,000,000 offer from John."
