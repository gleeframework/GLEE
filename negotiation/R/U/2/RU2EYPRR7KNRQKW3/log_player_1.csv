Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget.

While $1,350,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

I've reached a point where Bob and I are close on price, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  With only a few rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a higher offer from him. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
