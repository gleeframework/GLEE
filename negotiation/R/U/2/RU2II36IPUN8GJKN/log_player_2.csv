"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Rejecting Alice's offer makes sense here. You have a guaranteed alternative with John for $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further, getting you a better deal."
