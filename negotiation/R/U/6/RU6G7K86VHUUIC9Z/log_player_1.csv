"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a bit above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100. This is my final counteroffer. It's a fair compromise that's closer to Bob's desired price while still ensuring I receive at least my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not there.  I've already made significant concessions, and there's a real risk he'll keep refusing my offers. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I can get my desired price, and it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
