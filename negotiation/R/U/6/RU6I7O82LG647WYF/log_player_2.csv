Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer!  I appreciate your interest. $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $130?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""product_price"": 75
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here.  While $75 is too low, I'd be willing to let it go for $110.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, she's still significantly above your budget and has declared this her final offer.  It's unlikely she'll go down to $80, so it's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal from John."
