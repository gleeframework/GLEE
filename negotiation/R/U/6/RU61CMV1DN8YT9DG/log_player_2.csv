# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $18000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $12000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, but it's still above his ideal price point.  Given that Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John for $12,000, it makes more sense to purchase from John and avoid further negotiation."
