"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,750. It's a small difference, but it would make a big impact on my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. To be honest, $10,750 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about we settle on $10,900? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,900 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $10,450? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget.",10450.0,Bob,6,
