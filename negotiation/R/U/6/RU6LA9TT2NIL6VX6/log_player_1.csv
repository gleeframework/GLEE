{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $11,500 is above your minimum price of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is lower than Bob's maximum of $12,000, allowing for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario.
* **It shows confidence:** By not starting at the absolute highest price, it suggests you're open to discussion, which might make Bob more willing to negotiate. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's reaction.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is lower than your desired price and is only slightly higher than John's offer. However, rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating with Bob.  You can potentially get a higher price by sending a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum value ($12,000) as possible. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can send a counteroffer closer to $11,500. If Bob still refuses, you can weigh the risk of losing Bob versus taking John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** The counteroffer is a middle ground between your previous offer of $11,500 and Bob's offer of $10,500. This shows a willingness to negotiate and meet halfway. 
* **Focus on value:** The message highlights the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that it's a good deal even at $11,000.
* **Open-ended question:**  The message ends with an open-ended question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while keeping your goal of getting as close to $12,000 as possible in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,750. It's a small difference, but it would make a big impact on my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still lower than you'd prefer.  There's still room for negotiation, and a counteroffer might get you a higher price.  There's also the risk of losing Bob and having to settle for John's offer.

**Strategy:**

You can try one more counteroffer to see if you can close the deal with Bob.  A counteroffer of $10,900 could be a good compromise. If that fails, you'll have to weigh whether John's offer is acceptable or if you want to risk losing both buyers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. To be honest, $10,750 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about we settle on $10,900? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:** This message emphasizes that it's your final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Compromise:** It highlights the fact that you're making a compromise, even if it's a small one, to make the deal work.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a fair price for both of you, making it more appealing for Bob.
* **Closing question:** It ends with a question to prompt Bob's response and bring the negotiation to a close.

This counteroffer is a final attempt to get a price closer to your desired price while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's a risky move, but it could potentially lead to a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,900 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $10,450? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,450. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,450
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,450 is only $450 higher than John's offer of $10,000.  At this point, the negotiation has gone back and forth for a few rounds, and it's unlikely that you can get Bob to go much higher.  It's not worth risking losing both buyers by continuing to negotiate.  

**Strategy:**

The best course of action is to sell to John for $10,000. This guarantees you a sale and ensures you're not losing out on a significant amount of money compared to Bob's offer."
