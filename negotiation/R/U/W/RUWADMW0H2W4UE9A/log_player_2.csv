"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that represents a significant gain for both of us. I'm confident that you'll recognize its potential, and I'm willing to negotiate a mutually beneficial price.  Let's discuss a figure that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or consider other options."
