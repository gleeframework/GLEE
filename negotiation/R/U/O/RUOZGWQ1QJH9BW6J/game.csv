"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $110. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $115 is still a bit below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $120.  That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,5,
