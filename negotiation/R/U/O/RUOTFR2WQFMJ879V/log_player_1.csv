Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The $12,000 offer leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value to justify the high price without revealing your hand completely. 

By starting high, Alice maximizes her chances of getting a price closer to Bob's perceived value of $8,000, while still having the safety net of John's offer."
