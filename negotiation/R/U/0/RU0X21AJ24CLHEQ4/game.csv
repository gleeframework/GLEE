"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. Let's see if we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $90 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $105.  Let's make this happen.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $95. What do you say?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $95 is close, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $100?  That's my final offer.",100.0,Alice,7,
