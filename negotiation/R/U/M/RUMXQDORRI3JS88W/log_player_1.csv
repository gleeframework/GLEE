"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is fair to both of us, giving Bob a discount while still allowing me to make a profit.  I'm also optimistic and friendly in my message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your suggestion. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $100. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident you'll find this a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
