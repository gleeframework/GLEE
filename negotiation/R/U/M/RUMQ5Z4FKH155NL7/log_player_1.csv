Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the likelihood of acceptance.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly reminding Bob of its importance.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves a $50,000 gain for Bob, a strong incentive to accept. This price also nets you a $150,000 profit over your guaranteed offer from John.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just one possible approach. You could try a higher initial offer and leave room for negotiation. 
* Bob's personality and negotiation style are unknown.  Reading his responses and adapting your strategy might be necessary in a real-world scenario."
