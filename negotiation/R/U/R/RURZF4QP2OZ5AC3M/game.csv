"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, considering its worth to you is $15,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $12,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  Could you consider $17,000? I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually agreeable price.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, considering its worth to you is $15,000. I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
