Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $850,000 is a step closer, I'm still a bit away from my desired price point.  Let's find a mutually agreeable middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 for this product.  This allows for a significant profit for you and ensures a fair deal for me.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $950,000 is still above my target price, but I'm willing to come up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant step up from my previous offer but is still below Alice's current price. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal while maintaining a strong negotiation position. I believe this price is reasonable and fair for both parties."
