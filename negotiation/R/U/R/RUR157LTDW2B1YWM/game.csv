"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm confident this product will bring you significant returns, I can't go as low as $1,400,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
