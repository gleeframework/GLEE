{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's always better to try and negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000. This is a bold move, but since Alice's offer was so high, it's worth seeing if she's willing to come down to my price. If not, I can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better price. I'm confident that I can push Alice lower, as she's clearly motivated to sell the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but still want a good deal.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get her to accept, but I'm prepared to go another round if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While there's a chance I could negotiate further, it's not worth the risk. At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. It's better to buy from John and ensure I get the product within my budget."
