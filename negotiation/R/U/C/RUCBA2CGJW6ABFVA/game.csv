"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $8,500 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to do $7,200?",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,200 simply isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference - $7,800.  This is a fair price that considers both our perspectives.",7800.0,Alice,5,
