Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I've done some research and I believe the product's value is worth less to me than you think. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
