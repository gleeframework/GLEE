"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and it's within Bob's budget. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that John will raise his price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to secure the product at a good price."
