{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still allows me to earn a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm trying to be persuasive and friendly while also highlighting the value of the product to Bob.
* **Strategy:**  By starting with a price that is lower than my minimum but still reasonable, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. If he rejects the offer, I'll adjust my counter-offers based on his responses and John's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I believe I can get closer to my goal by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  I will try to counter with a price closer to $10,000 to see if I can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $9,750?  It's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $9,750, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for both of us to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Strategy:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, as it's closer to his offer. If he rejects it, I might have to reconsider selling to John, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for coming down to $9,750. I appreciate the effort. My counteroffer would be $9,600 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,600 is only $100 higher than his previous offer and still $2,400 below my minimum acceptable price.  While continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher price, it's getting very close to my minimum. Considering that I can sell to John for $12,000, I've decided to take the guaranteed higher price and sell to John."
