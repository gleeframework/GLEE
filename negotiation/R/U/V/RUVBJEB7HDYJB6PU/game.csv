"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $22,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. Could you consider $12,000 for the product?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing we both value this product.  To meet somewhere in the middle, let's make it $15,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still reflecting what the product is worth.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $15,000 is just outside my budget. I can offer $13,000.  I believe that's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
