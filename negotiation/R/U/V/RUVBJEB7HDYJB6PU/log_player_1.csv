Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider something closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $22,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing we both value this product.  To meet somewhere in the middle, let's make it $15,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still reflecting what the product is worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $15,000 is just outside my budget. I can offer $13,000.  I believe that's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to meet my $15,000 minimum.  He's incrementally increasing his offers, but at this rate, we'll waste valuable time in further negotiation. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
