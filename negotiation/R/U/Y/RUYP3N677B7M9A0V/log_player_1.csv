Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers.
* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob incentive to negotiate, as he still stands to gain value.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps avoid confusion and sets the tone for the negotiation.

By offering this price, you're setting the stage for a successful negotiation while still protecting your interests."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

While $920,000 is tempting, it's still not quite where I want to be. I'll counter with another offer."

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to result in a price close to my minimum. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
