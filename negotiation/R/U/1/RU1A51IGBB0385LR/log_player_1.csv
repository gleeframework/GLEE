Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be quite valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $20,000, we signal a willingness to negotiate, potentially landing somewhere between Bob's valuation and our guaranteed sale price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, we can adjust downwards, knowing our backup offer is secure. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject a high offer outright. However, this strategy maximizes potential profit if successful."
