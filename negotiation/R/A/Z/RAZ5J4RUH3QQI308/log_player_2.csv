"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $1,200,000.  Since Alice values the product at $800,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

Bob still has room to negotiate a better price. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer.  There's potential for further compromise.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to try and get closer to his target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to split the difference, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer is Close to Bob's Target:** Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is only $30,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $1,050,000.  This is a relatively small difference. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation is Limited:**  There's less room for negotiation at this point.  While Bob could make another counteroffer, it's likely Alice will be firm, as she's already lowered her price significantly.
* **Risk of Buying from John:** If Bob rejects Alice's offer and tries to get a lower price, he risks Alice walking away from the deal and being forced to buy from John at a significantly higher price ($1,500,000). 

It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's still within his budget and saves him a significant amount compared to buying from John."
