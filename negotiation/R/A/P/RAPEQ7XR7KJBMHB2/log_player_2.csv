"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, but I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer it to you for $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $955,000. This is the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.
