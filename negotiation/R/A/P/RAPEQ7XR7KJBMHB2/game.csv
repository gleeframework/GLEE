"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, but I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but  $1,100,000 is a bit steep. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $980,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $980,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $950,000.  Would you be willing to consider $930,000?",930000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your target price, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $960,000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",960000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $960,000 is still a bit beyond where I'm comfortable. My absolute best offer is $945,000. If this works for you, we have a deal.",945000.0,Bob,6,

"I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $955,000. This is the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",955000.0,Alice,7,
