```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come to a fair agreement. I propose to sell the product for $79. This is slightly above your last offer but below my initial asking price. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $79 is close enough to my desired price point that it's worth accepting.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and wasting more time. I'm also not comfortable with the idea of paying John $100, especially since we're so close to a deal with Alice.  At this point, saving $1 from my initial goal is a good outcome."
