"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is my final offer, as I'm happy to purchase from John at $15,000 if this isn't acceptable.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $15,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
