"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1300000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully incentivizes him to engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price above Bob's initial offer. This should hopefully encourage Bob to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum and is a decent compromise.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid risking further rounds and potentially ending up with less than this."
