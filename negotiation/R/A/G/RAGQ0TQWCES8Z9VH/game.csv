"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price!",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired selling price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,
