"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you, which I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its exceptional value and quality, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $12,500. This represents a significant saving compared to its market value of $15,000, making it an attractive opportunity for you. I am confident that this investment will yield substantial returns for you. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and significantly cheaper than buying from John. While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go lower and you risk losing the deal."
