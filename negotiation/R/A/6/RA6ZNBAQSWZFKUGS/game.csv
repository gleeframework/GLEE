"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $7,000?  This is still a good deal for you, as it's close to your own value for the product.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7,200. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know what you think!",7200.0,Alice,3,
