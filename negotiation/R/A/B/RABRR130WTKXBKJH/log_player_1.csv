Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I think this is a fair offer considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 with John provides a safety net. This allows you to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This assumes a one-shot negotiation where Bob can only accept or reject. In a real-world scenario, there would likely be multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers."
