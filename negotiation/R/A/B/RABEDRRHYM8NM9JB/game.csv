"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $920000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $920000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to go up to $890000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",890000.0,Bob,6,
