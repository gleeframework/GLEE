Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counter-offering at $110.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I hope this will incentivize him to accept, but I'm still firm on getting a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $108, which is close enough to my desired price. I'm happy to accept this offer and avoid any further negotiation."
