"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can meet the price of $1100000. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1050000. It's a fair price, considering the product's potential for you. I'm open to further discussion, but I won't go any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1050000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $950000 still isn't quite there for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go down to $1000000. It's my absolute final offer, reflecting the true value of this product for you. I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential benefits it will bring you.  I'm eager to finalize this transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
