"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $100. It's worthwhile to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you think $120 is a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high. I'm firm on my offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $120, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $145. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $145 is still above my budget, and we're at round 5.  While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement.  I'm confident that John will sell me the product for $100, so I'll take that option and avoid further negotiation."
