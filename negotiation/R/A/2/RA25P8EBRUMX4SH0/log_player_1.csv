{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly approach and a price point that is slightly lower than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly higher than my minimum threshold. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation and increases the likelihood of a successful deal."
