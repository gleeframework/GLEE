"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $15,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
