Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $120, but not setting the bar too high.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so there's a chance he'll accept. 
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** By including a message, you demonstrate that you're willing to talk. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, considering its value to me. I think it's a reasonable price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While I value your business, $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about $135?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $132 for the product, as I think it's the maximum I'm willing to spend 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is only $3 below my initial counteroffer.  It's a good deal, and I'm confident I can't do much better with him."
