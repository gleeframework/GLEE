Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get as much as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $12,000 is a significant discount from my minimum price but still allows for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation open and positive. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer.  If it's too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial price. If it's within a reasonable range, I'll consider accepting it.  However, I'll always have the option to stop negotiating and sell to John for my minimum price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also far below my initial offer of $12,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll need to strike a balance between being firm in my price and keeping the negotiation open.  If Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll consider selling to John for my guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This still represents a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping a significant margin for myself.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and emphasizing that we're both trying to find a solution.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, suggesting that $10,750 is fair and mutually beneficial.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll assess his next offer. If it's still far below my minimum price, I'll consider selling to John. However, I'm still willing to negotiate to find a mutually agreeable price, but I won't be pressured to accept a price that undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also not a significant enough improvement to justify accepting it.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'll try to find a balance between being firm in my price and keeping the negotiation open. If Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll seriously consider selling to John for my guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm making a small compromise by reducing my offer from $10,750 to $10,500, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that my counteroffer is fair considering the product's worth. 
* **Finality:** I'm using language suggesting that this might be my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potential for agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll strongly consider selling to John for $15,000. However, if Bob comes closer to my offer, I'm still open to negotiation. The goal is to maximize my earnings while also considering the likelihood of a successful deal."
