"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.

While $9,000 is better than $9,500, you're still within your budget and can try to get a lower price.  Let's see if you can negotiate further."
