"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. How about $8,750? That's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",8750.0,Bob,4,
