"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is close to my limit, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product's value to her is lower. By rejecting this initial offer, I can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting significantly lower than Alice's offer, I'm aiming to create room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  My message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer. I'm also providing a reason for my counteroffer (budget).
* **Leaving Space:** Offering $11,000 leaves a $3,000 gap from Alice's offer and a $4,000 buffer from my maximum budget, allowing for some back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is too low for me. Could you do $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, but there's still room for improvement. A $1,000 reduction suggests she's willing to negotiate. I'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? "",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price. 
* **Simple and Direct:**  The message is clear and proposes a straightforward solution.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By not immediately accepting $13,000, I maintain a negotiating position and signal that I'm looking for the best possible deal."
