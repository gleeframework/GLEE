Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale! I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $150, which is higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and open to negotiation, making it more likely Bob will counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer of $120 in mind as my fallback option. If negotiations with Bob don't go well, I can always go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's good that he's interested, accepting his offer would mean losing a substantial amount of money.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and try to find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $100. This shows flexibility and keeps negotiations going.
* **Message:** I'm still friendly and reiterate the value proposition for Bob.
* **Fallback Option:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with selling for that price. It's important to stand my ground and try to secure a higher price. I'm willing to risk losing the sale to Bob and counteroffer again, hoping he'll budge further. Remember, I have John as a backup, which gives me more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is a great product and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let's make this deal happen!  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm coming down to $95, which is still above my minimum but shows flexibility. This is a compromise to try to close the deal.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and expressing my desire to finalize the sale.
* **Fallback Option:**  I'm aware of John's offer, but I believe a deal with Bob at $95 is still better."
