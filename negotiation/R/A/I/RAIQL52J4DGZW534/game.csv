"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it today.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is a great product and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let's make this deal happen!  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
