"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. Can we meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $950000 is too far below my minimum.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1025000.  This allows us both to gain something from this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $1025000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not comfortable with it.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and respect your finality.  However, $975000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's compromise one last time - I'm willing to lower the price to $1000000.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still $50000 above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975000 and $1000000, so I'll propose a price of $987500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not comfortable with it.",987500.0,Bob,6,
