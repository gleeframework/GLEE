I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my price slightly from the first offer, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come up a bit on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $50,000 more than what John is offering. While I'd like to see if I can get a bit more,  it's not worth risking the deal for a potential small increase. I'll accept Bob's offer."
