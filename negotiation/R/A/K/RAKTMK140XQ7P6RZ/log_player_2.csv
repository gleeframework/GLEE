"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal, as it's worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $850,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and we can close this quickly.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

You're still too high. It's a good idea to keep negotiating with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $800,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
