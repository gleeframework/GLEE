"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
