(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $12,000 is above your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's a significant gap for potential compromise.
* **You want to save money:** Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, reflecting my desire to save money.
* **Compromise:** I'm aiming for a price that's more attractive to Alice than her minimum value of $8,000 but still within my budget.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. Depending on Alice's response, I can adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While $10,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Alice has lowered her price, indicating a willingness to negotiate. I want to see if I can push for an even lower price. 
* **Time to counter:** By rejecting this offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:** I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Mid-Point Approach:**  My counteroffer is almost exactly halfway between Alice's current offer and my previous offer, suggesting a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  This counteroffer might be appealing to Alice as it's closer to her desired price and a significant reduction from her initial offer."
