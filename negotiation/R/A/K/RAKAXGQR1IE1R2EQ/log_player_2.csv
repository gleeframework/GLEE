"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's a unique opportunity tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Considering its true worth of $15,000 to you, we're offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. This is a chance to secure an item that could significantly enhance your experience or project. Let's make this a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While she claims it's worth $15,000 to you, you know your budget is $15,000, meaning it's the absolute maximum you'd spend.  By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of getting a better deal. You can always try to negotiate with Alice or go with your backup plan of buying from John at your maximum budget."
