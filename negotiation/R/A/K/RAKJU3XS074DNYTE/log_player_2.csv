Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my target. I'm offering you the product for $795,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.

It's time to switch to John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $795,000 and is playing a tough bargaining game.  Since you can get the product for $800,000 from John, it's not worth the risk of continuing with Alice and potentially paying even more."
