"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.

While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm comfortable with. It's worth rejecting and sending another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and my original offer of $1,200,000. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.

While I'd like to get the product from Alice, $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget. It's time to go with the guaranteed option and buy from John for $800,000."
