Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1200000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1350000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to go to $1300000. This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,300,000 is a good price, and it's getting late in the negotiation. I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer."
