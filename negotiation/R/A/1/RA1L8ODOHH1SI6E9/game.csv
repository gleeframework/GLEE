"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it would make for a successful transaction for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $815,000, which is the minimum I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
