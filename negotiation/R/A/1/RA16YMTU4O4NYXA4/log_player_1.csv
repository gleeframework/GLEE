"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80, which is the price I've seen it for elsewhere. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
