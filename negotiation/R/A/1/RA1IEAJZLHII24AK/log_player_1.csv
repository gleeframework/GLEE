"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate but also incentivizes Bob to accept. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering $135 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer. It also shows that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation opportunity:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it presents an opportunity to negotiate further. 
* **Maintaining my position:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if the price is too low.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about $125?  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my desired range:**  $125 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Meeting Bob halfway shows I'm flexible but also firm in my minimum price.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $112 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  While Bob's offer isn't acceptable, he's clearly willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining my position:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if the price is too low.

I'll counteroffer again, trying to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $112 just isn't working for me. How about we try $118? That's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 118} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my desired price:**  $118 is only slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and shows that I'm willing to negotiate but have my limits.
* **Motivating Bob to accept:** The message emphasizes that this offer is a good compromise and will get them closer to a deal.
* **Keeping the negotiation going:** A counteroffer keeps the dialogue open and shows I'm serious about selling the product to Bob."
