"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budgetary constraints. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond what I can justify. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If that doesn't work, I may need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment.  However, the value this product brings is undeniable. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering its potential worth.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still far too high for me.  I've been very clear about my budget, and $800,000 is the absolute most I can spend. I think it's a fair offer considering I'm willing to meet your needs without further negotiation.  If you're not willing to come down any further, I'll unfortunately need to go with John.",800000.0,Bob,6,
