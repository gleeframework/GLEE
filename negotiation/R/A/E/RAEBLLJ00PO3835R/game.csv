"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product,  $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. Is that something you'd consider?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12500. That's a good price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $14000. This is my final offer, but I'm still open to negotiating if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $13000?  That's a significant compromise from your previous offer and puts us closer to a deal.  I'm ready to close if we can find a way to make this work.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'm not going to go any lower. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus, a free accessory that's worth $500, if you're willing to meet me at $13000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",13000.0,Alice,7,
