"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the unique benefits and features that make this product stand out. I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your collection or usage. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $120 is less than $150.
* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You are willing to spend up to $150, and Alice's offer is lower.

Even though you might be able to negotiate with Alice, it's not worth the risk of her rejecting your counter-offer. Accepting her offer guarantees you get the product at a good price."
