"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 was a bit steep, but $10,000 is also a bit low considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit far from where I'd like to be. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
