"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, aiming to maximize my profits.  I'm pricing it slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  However, I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price, so I'm not overly attached to this specific offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm open to negotiating,  I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's initial offer but still above my minimum.  This shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a decent return. I'm hopeful this will be a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal, and there's no point in risking further negotiation.  I'd rather secure the sale and move on."
