"Dear Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a more reasonable price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but I'd like to see some flexibility on your part.

"Dear Alice, thank you for considering my previous counteroffer and making a new proposal. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product is worth less than $1600000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1450000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.

"Dear Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1550000. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $1480000. This price is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to stay within my budget. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1500000.",1480000.0,Bob,6,
