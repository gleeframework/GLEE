Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will counteroffer to try and reach a price that is closer to my desired value."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.
