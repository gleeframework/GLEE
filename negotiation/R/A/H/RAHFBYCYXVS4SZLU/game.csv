"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'll make one final offer: $875,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll be forced to explore other options.",875000.0,Bob,6,
