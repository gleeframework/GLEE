"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth from John.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That initial price is quite high, though. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be a more realistic starting point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Low:** Starting significantly lower than your $1,000,000 maximum gives you room to negotiate upwards throughout the rounds. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  While $800,000 is low, it shows Alice you're serious but willing to find a middle ground.
* **Setting a Tone:** This counter-offer establishes that you've done your research and won't be easily swayed by high initial prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment for your business. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still way above your budget and John's offer. There's no need to jump on this offer yet.  Let's keep negotiating!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I can do $1,100,000. This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging my financial limits."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're bumping up our offer to show Alice we're willing to move, but we're keeping it well below her price.
* **Staying Below John:**  It's crucial to remain under $1,000,000, ensuring we always have John's offer as a backup. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""budget"" and ""financial limits,"" we're reinforcing the idea that our offers are tied to real constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer demonstrates a real commitment to acquiring the product.  However, we need to find a price that reflects its true value for both of us. Considering we are over halfway through our negotiation time, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by claiming this is her final offer. It's designed to apply pressure, but we shouldn't fold just yet.
* **Still Too High:**  Even with the discount, $1,600,000 is way above both our budget and John's offer. 
* **Leverage:** We still have time and the option of buying from John, which gives us some leverage. 

Let's see if Alice is truly firm on her ""final offer"" or if we can push her down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but I have to be realistic about my budget. $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $1,250,000.  This is a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering we both want to see this deal happen."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the ""Final Offer"":** By making another counteroffer, we're seeing if Alice was serious about her ""final offer"" or if there's still room for negotiation.
* **Significant Jump:**  We're increasing our offer by $150,000, a large enough jump to demonstrate seriousness while staying below our limit.
* **Urgency and Compromise:** We're reminding Alice that we both benefit from a successful deal and that time is ticking away."
