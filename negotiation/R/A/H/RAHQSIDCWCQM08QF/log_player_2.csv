"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000, which is a great deal considering its worth to me.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. It makes more sense to try to get a better deal from Alice or go with John's offer."
