Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer because I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm also being friendly and positive to create a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. After considering the value of the product, I am willing to pay up to $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as John's, and I'm not likely to get a better price.  It's better to take the sure thing and sell to Bob."
