"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a unique item and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
 
The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $11,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and your desired selling point. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $10,500 is within Bob's budget and still a better deal than buying from John. It's a good compromise, considering the initial offer."
