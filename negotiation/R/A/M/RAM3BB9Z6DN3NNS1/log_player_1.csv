Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a unique item and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong price, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a message that acknowledges the value of the product.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer based on his response and consider selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and your desired selling point. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll start with a counteroffer that's closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 10500}
