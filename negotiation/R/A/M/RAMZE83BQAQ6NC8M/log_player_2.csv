"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's a $100,000 saving compared to John, but there's room for improvement.
* **There's potential for a better deal.**  Alice is motivated to sell (her value is $1,000,000), so a counteroffer might be successful. 
* **The risk of rejection is manageable.** If Alice rejects the counteroffer, I can always buy from John.

By rejecting the offer, I can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to go $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my target price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves her with a $250,000 profit. 
* **Appeal to fairness:**  The message emphasizes a fair price based on both parties' values. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There is still room for Alice to counter and for us to compromise if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.** It's a $50,000 reduction from her initial offer, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate.
* **The price is good for Bob.**  $1,350,000 is still a good deal for Bob, saving him $150,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.** While a lower price is always desirable, the potential gain from further negotiation is limited. There's a chance Alice might be unwilling to go lower, risking a stalemate and forcing Bob to buy from John.

Accepting Alice's offer is the most rational decision, as it secures a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing time and potentially a better outcome."
