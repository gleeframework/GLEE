"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to go $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my target price.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
