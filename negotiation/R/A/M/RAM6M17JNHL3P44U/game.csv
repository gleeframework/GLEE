"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay that price for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline. I believe the value of the product exceeds $100, and I would like to maintain its perceived value. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering $110 as a potential price for the product?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $105 would be a more reasonable price for me. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. While I initially set a higher price, I appreciate your willingness to engage in the negotiation process. Considering our discussion, I propose a price of $108 for the product. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle while still valuing the product appropriately. Would you like to accept this offer?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $108. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $105, so I'll make a counteroffer of $107. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",107.0,Bob,6,
