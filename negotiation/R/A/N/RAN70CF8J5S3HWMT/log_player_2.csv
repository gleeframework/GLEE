"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is a bit above its value to her, it's still below your maximum price of $12,000 and a better deal than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $500 compared to your alternative."
