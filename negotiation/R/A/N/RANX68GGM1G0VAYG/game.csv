"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $102.50?",102.5,Alice,5,
