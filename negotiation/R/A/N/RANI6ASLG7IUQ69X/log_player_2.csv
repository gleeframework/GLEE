"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $80 for the product. Since Alice is offering it at $80, you are not getting a discount. You can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer."
