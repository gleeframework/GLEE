"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's well below what you're willing to pay.  However, I'm confident I can sell it to someone else for $1,500,000 if you're not interested.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what Bob is willing to pay, it's still higher than what he could get from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product from John for a significantly lower price."
