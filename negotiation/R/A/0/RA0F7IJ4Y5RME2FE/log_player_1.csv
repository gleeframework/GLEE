Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know you'll find it incredibly valuable."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum.
* **Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John for $10,000, ensuring she doesn't lose out."
