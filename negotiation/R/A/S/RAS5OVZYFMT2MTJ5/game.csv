"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $1,350,000? That's a good compromise, and still leaves room for both of us to be happy.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still at my limit.  How about $1,300,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your limit, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $1,325,000? That's a small step up from your offer, and I think it's a good compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
