Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,250,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000. I have 9 rounds left, so there's still room to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $1,350,000? That's a good compromise, and still leaves room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still at my limit.  How about $1,300,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.
