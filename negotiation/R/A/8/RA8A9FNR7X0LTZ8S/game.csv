"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you presenting this product to me. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my offer of $8000. If you're not able to accept that, I'll need to look elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,4,
