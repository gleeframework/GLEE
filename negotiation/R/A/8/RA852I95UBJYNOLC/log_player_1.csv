"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing my product is worth at least $80 to me. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my desired value, but I'm also prepared to accept John's offer of $80 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $90 is within a reasonable range and higher than John's offer of $80.  I'll accept his offer to ensure I get a profit and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
