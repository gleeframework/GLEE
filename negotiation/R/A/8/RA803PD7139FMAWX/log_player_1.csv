Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he could potentially profit by $100,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to make a profit while also securing a significant amount for you (much closer to his perceived value than your minimum). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, should he desire."
