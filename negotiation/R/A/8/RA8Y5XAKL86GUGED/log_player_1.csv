{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher price. This strategy aims to:

* **Start strong:**  By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, it demonstrates my understanding of the product's worth. 
* **Open a dialogue:** This offer encourages Bob to engage in a negotiation rather than immediately rejecting a lower price.
* **Maximize profit:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm aiming for a substantial profit while remaining open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that's a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still secure a better deal. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still gives you a significant benefit, and it's closer to a fair value for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet Bob halfway. 
* **Maintains a good margin:**  $1,000,000 is still a good profit for me while offering a more appealing price to Bob.
* **Keeps the negotiation going:** It encourages Bob to continue the conversation and potentially reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000 and call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and is closer to my desired price than any previous offer.  It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept it."
