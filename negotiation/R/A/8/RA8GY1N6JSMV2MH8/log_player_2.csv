{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my budget. With only one round left, it's not worth the risk of trying to negotiate further. I've made several counteroffers and Alice has consistently rejected them.  It's likely that she is unwilling to come down to my desired price range.  Therefore, buying from John at $1,200,000 is the best option to secure the product while staying within my budget."
