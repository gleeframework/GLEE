"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $80 to Bob. Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's best to reject and counteroffer to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $120, which is my absolute minimum. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way down to $90, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $120. How about we try $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $105 is a better offer than previous rounds, it's still above Bob's desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go down to $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $105. How about we try $100? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it. Plus, it's getting close to my minimum price, so I'm willing to consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still more than he's willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get Alice down to a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $97, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 97}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go down to $97, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $97 and $105. How about we try $101? It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has only one round left and Alice's offer is still significantly higher than his maximum price point. He's likely not going to be able to get her down to his target price in one round.  It's better to cut his losses and buy from John for $80."
