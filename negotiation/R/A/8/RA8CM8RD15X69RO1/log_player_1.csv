Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offers, his final offer of $850,000 is still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000.  

* **Bob's Pattern:** Bob's negotiation tactic seems to be incremental increases. Even if he continues this pattern, it's unlikely he'll reach John's offer within the remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing with Bob has a potential upside (getting him higher than $850,000) but also carries the risk of him walking away. John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000.

At this point, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential but risky upside with Bob."
