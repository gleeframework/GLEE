"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  It's too high, and you can get a better deal from John.  You'll counter-offer Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for 950000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You should reject Alice's offer again. While it's lower than her first offer, it's still too high. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, so you want to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $950,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for 900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for 975000. This is my final offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is being stubborn, and while $975,000 is lower than her previous offers, it's still higher than what you can get from John. At this point, it's better to just buy the product from John for $800,000 and save yourself the hassle of further negotiation."
