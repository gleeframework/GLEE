"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This will hopefully encourage Bob to accept or at least make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for more. I still have 9 rounds left to negotiate, and Bob has already shown a willingness to pay more than my minimum. I will try to push for a higher price in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is stuck at $850,000, but I'm still not happy with that price. I've got 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can push for a better deal. There's a chance I could get closer to my initial asking price or at least secure something closer to $900,000.  I'll see if a counteroffer will budge Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $880,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to reach an agreement while also ensuring I get a price above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $830,000 is tempting, I still have 4 rounds left, and I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob at a higher price. Even if we don't, I can always sell to John as a last resort. I'm going to see if a counteroffer can get Bob closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $860,000. This is a further compromise, but still above Bob's current offer and closer to my desired value. With only 3 rounds left, I need to secure a deal that's acceptable, but I still have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although we're getting close to John's offer, I still have two rounds to try and get a better deal. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 840000} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to make a final attempt to meet Bob halfway. I'm offering $840,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This is still above John's offer, and I'm hoping it will finally be enough to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only one round remaining and Bob unwilling to budge, it's time to secure the deal with John. While I'd prefer a higher price,  $800,000 is my minimum, and I can't risk losing the opportunity altogether. It's better to guarantee the sale and avoid the uncertainty of another rejected offer."
