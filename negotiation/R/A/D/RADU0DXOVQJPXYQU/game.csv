"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. It's still a good deal for you, considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. It's still a good deal for you, considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you. Plus, it's a fair price considering the original offer I made was $12,000.",10000.0,Alice,5,
