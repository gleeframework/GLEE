Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is more than $8,000, so Bob has an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  $10,000 is still above your minimum of $12,000, giving you room to negotiate downwards if needed.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged.  You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. Selling to John for $12,000 is the most profitable option at this point. However, before committing to that, it's worth exploring a counteroffer to Bob to see if you can bridge the gap.  There's a chance you might be able to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It shows you're willing to negotiate while still remaining above Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Reasoning:** You've explained your reasoning, emphasizing the product's value and your willingness to reach a fair agreement. 
* **Next Steps:** You're keeping the door open for further negotiation, encouraging Bob to meet you halfway.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Keep the negotiation going:**  It avoids a stalemate and keeps the potential for a deal alive.
* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates your willingness to compromise, making Bob more likely to accept.
* **Increase your profit:** It aims for a price closer to your desired $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $8800? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than your desired price, and while it's tempting to keep negotiating, the potential for a better deal is slim. At this point, you've already rejected Bob's initial offer and made a counteroffer.  The risk of continuing is that you might end up with a lower price than what John is offering, or you could be stuck in a prolonged negotiation with no guarantee of a successful outcome.

**It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing.** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $12,000, which is more than what Bob is currently offering. It's the most sensible choice in this situation."
