(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  I can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 30}
``` 

I'm starting with a low offer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $30 is a significant discount from her initial price, and I'm hoping it will prompt her to consider a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $40
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $40 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again to see if I can close in on a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 35}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still keeping it below Alice's last offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also trying to push for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$45 is still a bit higher than I'd like, but it's getting closer. I'm not ready to accept yet. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get it down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
```

I'm going to meet Alice halfway on this one.  Hopefully, she'll accept my counteroffer and we can finalize the deal.  If not, I'm close enough to my limit that I'm prepared to go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $47.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $47.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, and I'm getting close to my limit. It's a good price, and it's worth accepting to avoid the risk of losing out on the product entirely."
