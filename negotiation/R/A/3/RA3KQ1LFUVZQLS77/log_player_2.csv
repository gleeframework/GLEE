I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to come down from her initial price. I'm confident I can get it for less than $900,000, and this counteroffer sets the stage for negotiation."

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price point."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a better price.  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while staying within my budget."

Alice has come down to $835,000.  This is a good price, and continuing to negotiate risks potentially having Alice walk away or ending up with a worse deal.  I'm happy to secure the product at this price."
