"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  The value this product offers is substantial. Would you consider $900,000?  I'm confident it will more than prove its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
