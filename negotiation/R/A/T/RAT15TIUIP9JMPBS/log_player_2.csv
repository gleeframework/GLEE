"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $170.  I think it's a great deal and worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
That offer is way too high! It's much better to negotiate or go with John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a very low offer ($60) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. This also helps me gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Direct:** My message is polite to maintain a good negotiating environment, but it also clearly states that the initial offer is unacceptable and presents my counteroffer.
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to buy the product for significantly less than John's $80 price.  This low starting point allows for that possibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $60 is significantly less than what I can accept. Could you consider something closer to $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $140 is better than the initial offer, but it's still significantly more than I'm willing to pay and more than John's price.
* **Room to Negotiate:** Alice's willingness to come down suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Alternative Exists:** I still have the safety net of buying from John for $80 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about $75? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a good deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:**  I want to demonstrate that I'm willing to move towards her price, hence the $15 jump. 
* **Targeting Below John:** My goal is still to get the price below John's $80 offer. 
* **Mutually Beneficial Framing:** I'm trying to position this offer as a win-win situation, appealing to her desire to sell the product."
