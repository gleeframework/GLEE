"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would still give you a substantial profit while allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still struggling to justify $1,150,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant step for me. This would leave some room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
