"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can reach a price closer to your maximum.  You can either try to counter with a lower offer, or you might consider exploring options with John while keeping the negotiation with Alice open."
