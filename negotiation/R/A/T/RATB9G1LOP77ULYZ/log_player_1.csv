{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but still allows for room for negotiation. It also positions me to make a decent profit while still leaving some space to adjust if needed. I'm keeping John as a safety net in case the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would still give you a substantial profit while allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value.  I need to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob continues to fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring I make a decent profit. I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward and demonstrating my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution. I'm mindful of John's offer as a safety net if Bob rejects my counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still struggling to justify $1,150,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant step for me. This would leave some room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's latest offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my ideal price point.  While I'd prefer to push for even more, I'm starting to feel the pressure to make a decision.  It's risky to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially lose him as a buyer, especially with John's offer looming.  I'm going to accept this offer and secure the sale,  as it represents a good profit margin and a reasonable outcome for both of us."
