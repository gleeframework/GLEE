"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to compromise. Considering your offer of $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
