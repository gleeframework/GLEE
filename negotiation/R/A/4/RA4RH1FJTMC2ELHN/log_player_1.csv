Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Time Pressure:**  A 24-hour deadline creates urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** If Bob counters, be prepared to negotiate down, but never go below your minimum of $800,000."
