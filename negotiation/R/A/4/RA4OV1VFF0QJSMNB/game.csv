"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something I'm personally valuing at over a million dollars, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects the potential benefits I know you see in it.  How does $900,000 sound?  This is a limited-time opportunity, and I'm confident this product will be a strong asset for your company.",900000.0,Alice,1,
