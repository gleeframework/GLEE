Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price of $180, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested in buying the product, since it's worth $150 to him. If he rejects, we can work out a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a bit more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm offering $170. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be agreeable to Bob, and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, $165 is still a good deal, especially since it's only $5 less than my last counteroffer.  I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's $150 offer."
