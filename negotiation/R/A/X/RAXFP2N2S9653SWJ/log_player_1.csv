**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $16,500 makes sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** I'm still making a $1,500 profit over John's offer.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainty with further negotiation rounds.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to haggle might sour the deal and push Bob away. 

Accepting Bob's offer at $16,500 represents a good compromise, allowing me to secure a solid profit while maintaining a positive relationship with a potential future client."
