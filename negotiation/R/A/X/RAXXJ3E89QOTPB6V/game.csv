"Alice, $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers a lot of value, and I could easily sell it for $15,000 elsewhere.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
