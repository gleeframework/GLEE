"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a chance to consider the value of the product while also ensuring I maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. Bob is clearly trying to lowball me.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a good price for the product. It's a fair compromise considering Bob's lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still lowballing me. While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not desperate to sell and have a safety net with John's offer. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,350,000. This shows that I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal but I'm also demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.  This is a significant compromise and I hope it will be enough to get Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still not meeting my minimum value.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum, especially since I'm close to my safe net with John's offer. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up even slightly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

I'm raising my offer to $1,275,000. This is a small increase, but it demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping this small increase will be enough to convince Bob to finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only three rounds left, and Bob refusing to budge from his minimum offer, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I would prefer a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing a guaranteed sale with John. I need to secure the deal and move on."
