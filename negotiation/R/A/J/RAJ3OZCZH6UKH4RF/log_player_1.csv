Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we agree on $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a more significant reduction. How about we try $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly aware of the value of the product and is trying to negotiate a lower price.  While his offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and can likely get a better price than $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about splitting the difference again and settling on $987,500?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about we try $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is consistently moving towards our acceptable price range, he is doing so in smaller increments. We are still ahead of our guaranteed sale price with John, and we can apply a bit more pressure to potentially secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect your approach. However, this product offers significant value, and I need to ensure it's reflected in the final price.  $981,250 is my final offer.  It represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 981250
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're entering the later stages of negotiation, so it's strategic to introduce a sense of urgency and finality.  By presenting this as our ""final offer"" while still slightly above John's price, we aim to nudge Bob towards a decision while maximizing our potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $981,250 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $970,000, and I think that's a fair compromise. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has introduced a ""walk-away"" point in the negotiation. While we could try to push him further, his offer is now below our guaranteed sale price with John. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risking a lower offer or a failed negotiation with Bob."
