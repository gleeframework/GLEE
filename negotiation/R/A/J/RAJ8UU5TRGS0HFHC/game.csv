"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more so than for me.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a significant offer, I'm still confident that this product's true value to you is much higher.  Would you consider $900,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $900,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  Let's get this deal done.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I believe we can find a price that reflects the true value of this product for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,5,
