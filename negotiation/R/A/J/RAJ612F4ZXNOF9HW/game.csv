"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still a good value for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",800000.0,Alice,3,
