"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I think that's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility shown. However, I still cannot exceed $8,000 for the product. Would you be able to lower the price further?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here.  I truly believe this product is worth $9,000 to you, given its value.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,500.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'm going to have to move on to other buyers.",8500.0,Alice,5,
