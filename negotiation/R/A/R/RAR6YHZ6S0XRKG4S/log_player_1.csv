"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than mine ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  I'm aware I have a guaranteed offer from John, but I'll aim to maximize my profit with Bob before settling for John's offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob to engage in a discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask.  I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $950,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing $1,150,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget concerns."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've come down from $1,300,000 to $1,150,000, essentially meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message maintains firmness on the product's value while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Aiming Higher:** I'm still aiming for a price point above $1,100,000 to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our interests.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has steadily increased his offer, and $1,050,000 is a strong profit, exceeding my minimum by $250,000. While I could push for a slightly higher amount, continuing carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiations stalling. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
