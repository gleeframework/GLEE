"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $950,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing $1,150,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our interests.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
