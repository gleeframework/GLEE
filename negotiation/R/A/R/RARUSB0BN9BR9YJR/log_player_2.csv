"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get a better deal from John for $100, so there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. You can try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her original price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can try to negotiate further with Alice, aiming for a price closer to your target of $85.  John is still an option if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
