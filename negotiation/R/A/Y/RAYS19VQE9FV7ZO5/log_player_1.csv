I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to create a positive atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
