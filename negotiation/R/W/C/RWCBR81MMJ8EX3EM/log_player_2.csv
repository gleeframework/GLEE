The offered price is too high. It's much better to try negotiating a lower price or consider buying from John."

Alice is coming down, but the price is still a bit higher than what John is offering. We can try to negotiate a bit more to see if we can get closer to $110."

It seems Alice is not budging much on the price.  She's gone up instead of down. At this point, it's better to take John's offer of $120 and avoid further haggling."
