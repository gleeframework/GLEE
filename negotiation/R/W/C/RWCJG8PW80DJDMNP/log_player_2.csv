"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a good starting point, $1,350,000 is still more than Bob's ideal price range. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation as Alice is willing to sell for less than $1,350,000 (her value is $1,000,000). 
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John would be the last resort, as it's the most expensive option.

By rejecting, Bob can start the negotiation process and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,350,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a significant profit for you, given your value of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It's also a significant markup from Alice's value, leaving room for compromise.
* **Focus on profit:**  The message highlights the potential profit for Alice, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to compromise:** The closing line emphasizes Bob's willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. This product holds exceptional value, and I'm confident it will more than prove its worth to you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $1,250,000 is closer to Bob's target range, but it's still not ideal. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, suggesting a willingness to compromise.  
* **Avoid John:** Buying from John remains a last resort.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still above what I can reasonably afford at this time.  Considering the value you place on the product and my desire to acquire it, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This offer remains fair to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob increases his offer by a smaller amount ($50,000) showing that he's getting closer to accepting but still pushing for a better price.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** Bob re-emphasizes fairness, positioning his offer as reasonable considering both their values.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  The message highlights that this deal would be beneficial for both parties, encouraging Alice to consider it."
