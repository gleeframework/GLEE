"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value and my belief in the fairness of the price, aiming to influence Bob's perception. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By explicitly mentioning ""negotiations,"" I signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,350,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a significant profit for you, given your value of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our target price. While selling to John is an option, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. This product holds exceptional value, and I'm confident it will more than prove its worth to you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Firm:**  We're moving closer to Bob's offer to show flexibility but holding firm above the halfway point between his offer and our initial ask. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value again, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  By proposing a price directly in the middle, we signal a willingness to compromise while aiming for a more favorable outcome than Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still above what I can reasonably afford at this time.  Considering the value you place on the product and my desire to acquire it, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This offer remains fair to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,200,000 is a significant profit margin above our minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. Further haggling might be less effective.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations out longer risks losing Bob without a guarantee of a better deal elsewhere."
