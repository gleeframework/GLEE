"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Alice's offer is lower than what Bob is willing to pay, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $850,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,200,000, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to a minor further decrease in price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy for Bob in this round."
