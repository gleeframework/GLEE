"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and Alice is offering it at the same price, you are not saving any money. You can get the same product from John for the same price. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option. You can then buy the product from John."
