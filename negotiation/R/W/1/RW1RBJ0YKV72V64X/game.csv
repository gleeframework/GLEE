"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 seems a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer you the product for $130. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125 again. I'm willing to meet you halfway and split the difference between $125 and $130. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge any further. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $125, which would be $127.50. This is my final offer. What do you think?",127.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've compromised a lot, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $127.50. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $123. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think this is the best I can do. Can you consider that?",123.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway again, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $127.50. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to give you a small concession, but I need you to meet me at $126.50. This is my final offer. What do you think?",126.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $126.50. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm going to make one last offer of $122. I think this is the best I can do. Can you consider that?",122.0,Bob,10,
