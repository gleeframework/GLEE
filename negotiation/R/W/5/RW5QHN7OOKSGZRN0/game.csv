,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. Let's compromise at $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",950000.0,Bob,4,
