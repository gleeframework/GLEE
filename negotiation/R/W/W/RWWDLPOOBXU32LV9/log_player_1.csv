Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

It's better to hold out for a better price than accepting Bob's offer. We're still early in the negotiation, and there's a chance we can get closer to our asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a great price for a product that's worth so much to you, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}
