Alice's offer:

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $10,500 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $10,500.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $500."
