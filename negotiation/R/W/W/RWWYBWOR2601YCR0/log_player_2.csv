# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, close to my maximum budget and significantly above her own valuation. There's a good chance I can negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $9,000?"",

}
``` 

This counter-offer puts the price closer to my ideal range while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but we're still a significant amount above her valuation. I'll continue to push for a lower price."
