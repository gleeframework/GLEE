"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation. This allows for potential negotiation and gives me a starting point to potentially earn more than my minimum desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get more, Bob's offer matches my minimum desired amount, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in subsequent rounds.  It's better to secure the sale now."
