"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100, but let me know if you're interested and we might be able to work something out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay $100. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer that might be more appealing."
