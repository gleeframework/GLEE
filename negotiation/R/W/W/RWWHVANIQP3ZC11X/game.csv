"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential in this product, $2,250,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've highlighted.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your budget considerations, the value of this product is undeniable.  I could consider coming down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for considering my offer.  While I acknowledge the value of the product, $2,000,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a substantial savings for you.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and make this deal work.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer and understanding. I'm motivated to close this deal with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,875,000?  This represents a significant price reduction on my end and brings us closer to an agreement. What do you think?",1875000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,875,000 is a good offer, I'm still slightly above my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000.  This would represent a significant savings for you, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to see more movement to make this deal worthwhile for me. My final offer is $1,800,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's value.  Take some time to consider it, and let me know your decision.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
