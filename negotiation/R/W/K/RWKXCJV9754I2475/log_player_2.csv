``` 

**Explanation:**

* The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. 
* This is a good deal for you as you are saving $30 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though Alice is making a profit, it's still a better outcome for you than rejecting the offer and paying John $150."
