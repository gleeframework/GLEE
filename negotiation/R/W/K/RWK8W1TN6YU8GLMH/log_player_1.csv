Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding Bob's perspective.  We know he values the product at $10,000.  Any offer above that will be rejected. Offering the product for exactly $10,000 would get us the sale but leave potential profit on the table.  

Therefore, we should aim for an offer slightly below Bob's maximum valuation to maximize our potential earnings while still ensuring the sale is attractive to him.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for a special price of $9,500. I think it would be a valuable addition, and this offer saves you a significant amount compared to its true worth. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** We keep the message friendly, highlight a ""special price,"" and subtly imply the deal is in Bob's favor. 
* **Price:**  $9,500 is a compelling offer for Bob, saving him $500. This price also nets us a $2,500 profit over John's guaranteed offer. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate further. Be prepared to potentially adjust the price slightly upward, but remember, your fallback option (John) ensures you never have to sell for less than $12,000."
