Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer that's significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($200,000) between what Bob is willing to pay and what John is offering.

**The goal is to maximize profit while still securing a deal with Bob, avoiding the need to sell to John at a lower price.**"
