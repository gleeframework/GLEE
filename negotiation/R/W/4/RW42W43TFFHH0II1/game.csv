"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $160 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $90.  This is my best offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll need to consider other options.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While $90 is still less than I'd like, I'm willing to accept it if that's your absolute best offer.",90.0,Alice,5,
