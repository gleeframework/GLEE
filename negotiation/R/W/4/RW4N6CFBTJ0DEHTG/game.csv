"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not quite comfortable with $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $107.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105 again, or maybe even $104.50? I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",104.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $104.50. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I propose a price of $106.25. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",106.25,Alice,5,
