"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.  There's no incentive to negotiate further as you can buy the same product from John for the same price.  There's a chance you could get a lower price from Alice, but there's also a chance she'll refuse your counteroffers, wasting time and potentially leading to a higher price in the end. Buying from John guarantees the price you're willing to pay."
