"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,500,000 for the product?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the product's value significantly exceeds that price. I've factored in some flexibility, and I'm willing to let it go for $2,100,000. This is my final offer for today, and I believe it's a fair reflection of what the product brings to the table. Let me know if you're interested.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant.  To move this forward, I'm willing to consider $1,950,000.
