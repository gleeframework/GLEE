Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $12,000? It's a fair price for a product of this caliber.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $11,500? It's a bit of a stretch for you, but I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $11,000.  At this point, cutting your losses and taking the guaranteed $10,000 from John is the best move."
