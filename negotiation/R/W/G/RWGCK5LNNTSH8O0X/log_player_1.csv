"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $16,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your new offer. How about $13500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $13,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still too low.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's work together to finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $14000? I think that's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also mindful that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000. I need to weigh my options carefully in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still hesitant, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250.  This is a final compromise from my side.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $13875? I think that's a fair price and a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, we're running out of time and the price isn't getting close enough to my minimum acceptable price. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's closer to my desired value, so it's the best option for me at this point."
