"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $16000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your new offer. How about $13500? I think that's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13500 is still too low.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $14500. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's work together to finalize this deal!",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $14000? I think that's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're still hesitant, but $14000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14250.  This is a final compromise from my side. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in negotiations. Let's finalize this deal. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,7,
