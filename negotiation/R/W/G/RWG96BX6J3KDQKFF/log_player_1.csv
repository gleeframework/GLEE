"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is well above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  This is my maximum, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your current proposal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This reflects the real value of the product to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly above his perceived value and below my minimum. There's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the product's intrinsic value and market potential warrant a higher price. Let's find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,450,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate the compromise,  $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This represents a significant commitment from me, and I hope it's a reasonable compromise for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. We are nearing my minimum acceptable price, but there's still potential to negotiate a slightly better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be fair,  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the value this product offers."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting close.  While I value this product, $1,375,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a significant jump for me, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. However, his increases are getting smaller, and I'm not confident he'll reach $1,400,000. Selling to John guarantees my minimum price and avoids the risk of Bob stalling or the negotiations failing altogether."
