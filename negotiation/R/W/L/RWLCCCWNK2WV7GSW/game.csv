"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $8,750.  What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
