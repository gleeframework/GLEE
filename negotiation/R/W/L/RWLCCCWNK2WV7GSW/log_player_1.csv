{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for some negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product for Bob, which might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price, but it does show he's interested.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $8,750.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
