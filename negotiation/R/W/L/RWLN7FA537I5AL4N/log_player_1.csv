Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $135 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low for me. I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with him or sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $135 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $155? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 155}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $145 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
