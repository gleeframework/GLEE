I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but still gives me a good profit margin. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to settle for $9,000 just yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility but still securing a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is simply too low. I'm not willing to accept that price. While I'd prefer to make a profit, selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."
