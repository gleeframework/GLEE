"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this product. I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This leaves room for both of us to profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit too high at $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This is a reasonable price for both of us and I'm confident it reflects the product's value.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
