"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $11,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Could you do it for $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,500 for the product. This is a great compromise, and I think it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from this amazing product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I could do $7,000.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $8,500 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $7,500.  That's the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can do $8,200 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8200.0,Alice,7,
