``` 

This initial offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a slightly higher price than the product's value to Bob, but not too high to scare him away. I'm also being friendly and encouraging, hoping for a smooth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is still a good price, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000?  This price still allows you to save some money while ensuring I get a fair value for my product."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I don't want to go too far above my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is closer to my initial offer, I'm still not satisfied with it. I want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. I'm confident I can push for a higher price, and I'm not ready to settle yet."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us. Let's try one more time. How about $950,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my own needs.  It's also closer to your last offer, so I think it could be a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $937,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $937,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. 

While $937,500 is a good price, it's still not as high as I'd hoped. I've reached a point where I'm comfortable with the risk of Bob continuing to counteroffer.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'll choose the certainty of $1,000,000."
