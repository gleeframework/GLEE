Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob's offer is too low, but I can try to negotiate a better price with him. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to drop my price to $11,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I am still hopeful that I can get closer to $11,500. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is getting closer, I'm still not there yet. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,125? This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,125 is still a bit too high for me. How about $10,900? This is a firm offer, and I think it's more than fair.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, this is a fair price from Bob and we're getting close to the end of negotiations. If I reject his offer, we may not reach an agreement in time, and I'd be forced to sell to John at a lower price."
