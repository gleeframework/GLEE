Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  Please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at 150% of its value to both you and Bob aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your bottom line, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the price, you can gradually lower it, using your $1,500,000 guarantee from John as your absolute minimum."
