"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've given this a lot of thought, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that be workable?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get closer to $11,000, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",12500.0,Alice,5,
