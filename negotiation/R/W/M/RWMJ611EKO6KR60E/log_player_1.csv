"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about we settle on $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $12,500 is the sweet spot for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 isn't my ideal price, it's still a decent amount and closer to my minimum. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether, and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price."
