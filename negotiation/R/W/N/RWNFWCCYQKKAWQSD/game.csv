"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that much. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While your offer is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,600,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a chance to benefit.  Let's find a way to make this work. ",1600000.0,Alice,3,
