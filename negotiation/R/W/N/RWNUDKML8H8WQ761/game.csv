"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
