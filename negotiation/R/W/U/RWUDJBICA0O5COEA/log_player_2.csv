"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $120. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range I'm comfortable with. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $175 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get a price closer to my $120 limit.  There's still room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is still below my maximum budget and leaves some room for Alice to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be close enough for her to accept and avoid going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high. While $160 is getting closer to my budget, I still have some room to negotiate down further. I'm not willing to pay more than $120 unless absolutely necessary. I will continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final push here. This offer is right at the edge of my budget, but still leaves some room for Alice to get a slightly better price than John's offer. Hopefully, this is close enough for her to accept and we can close the deal.  If she rejects, it's time to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I'm willing to pay. We've reached the point where I'm unlikely to get her lower than my maximum budget, and the risk of going through more rounds with no guarantee of a better price is too high. 

I'm going to go with John's offer. It's a guaranteed deal at my limit and it's time to move on."
