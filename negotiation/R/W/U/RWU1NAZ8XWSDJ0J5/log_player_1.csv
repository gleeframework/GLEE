Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still lower than Bob's perceived value of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a compromise that's closer to his offer, but still allows me to earn a higher price than I would by selling to John. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good deal. It's higher than selling to John, and while it's not my ideal price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
