"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think $14,000 is a fair starting point. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a win-win!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can meet you at $13,000, Alice. I'm still a bit above my target. How about we try $11,500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get as close to my budget as possible.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is close, but I need to get a bit more. Would you consider $12,250?  That's my final offer.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,250. I can do $11,750, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I really want to make this deal work, but I need to stay within my budget.",11750.0,Bob,6,
