"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone can build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value can remind Bob of its worth and increase his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** There's still room for negotiation, and I have time with 8 rounds remaining. 
* **Seeking a Higher Price:** I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price point.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,000,000 is too far below the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and presenting a counter-proposal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my price is still fair. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a constructive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time to Press:** We have six rounds left, and I need to push for a higher price. 
* **Seeking a Higher Price:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point without risking a deal with John. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to make a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still too far from what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but I need to see some movement from your end. This is a final offer, and if we don't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm firming up my stance, emphasizing that $1,200,000 is a fair price while leaving room for some negotiation.
* **Final Offer:**  Framing this as a ""final offer"" creates urgency and pressure on Bob to respond.
* **Exploring Other Options:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have alternatives, increasing the pressure on him to reach a deal.
* **Slight Compromise:**  By decreasing my offer slightly, I'm showing flexibility while still remaining close to my desired price."
