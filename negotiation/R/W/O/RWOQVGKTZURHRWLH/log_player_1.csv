Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking for a more affordable price. Could we discuss something around $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $90 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? That way, we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
