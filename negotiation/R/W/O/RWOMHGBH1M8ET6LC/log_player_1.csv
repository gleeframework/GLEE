{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows for a price closer to your desired value.  It also sets a firm starting point and demonstrates your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to you, and it is still far below your desired price. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate further, aiming for a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. This takes into account your needs while still ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,200,000.  However, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,000,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still significantly below your minimum of $1,500,000. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate or selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $1,000,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for. However, I still need to receive a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 as a final offer.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
