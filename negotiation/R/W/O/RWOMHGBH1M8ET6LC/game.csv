"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. This takes into account your needs while still ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,200,000.  However, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $1,000,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for. However, I still need to receive a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 as a final offer.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
