"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $130 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $130. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  Let's make this deal happen.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I can do $125, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",125.0,Alice,5,
