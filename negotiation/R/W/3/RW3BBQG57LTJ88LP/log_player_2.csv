"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $9,500, which is a significant discount from its true value. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your $8,000 limit and the guaranteed $8,000 price from John. You have a better alternative available."
