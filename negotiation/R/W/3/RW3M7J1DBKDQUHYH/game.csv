"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm looking for.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your business, $900000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, recognizing the potential value this product can offer.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking for.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
