Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
