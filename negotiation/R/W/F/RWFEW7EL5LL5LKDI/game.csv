"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
