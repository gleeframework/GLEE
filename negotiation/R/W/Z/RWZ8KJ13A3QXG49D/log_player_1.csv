Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.

Bob's offer has dropped significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's clear we won't reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiation."
