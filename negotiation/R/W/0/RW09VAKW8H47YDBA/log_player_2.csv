"Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's highly unlikely that Alice would be willing to sell the product for $650,000 if it's worth more to her.  There's a good chance she's starting high and is open to negotiation.  By rejecting her offer, you can initiate a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals that I'm serious about negotiating and I'm not willing to pay her asking price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and this low offer will hopefully prompt her to consider a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but $550,000 is still too high. I'm still confident that I can get a better price.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still believe a lower price is possible.  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground, which hopefully will encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $500,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm confident that I can get the price down closer to my desired range. By rejecting the offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 475000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise and come closer to her offer. It also demonstrates that I'm still not satisfied with the price and believe there's still room to negotiate. This approach aims to encourage Alice to accept my offer or come down to a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $490,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $490,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price and is now offering a price that's only $25,000 higher than my last counteroffer.  At this point, it's becoming increasingly likely that Alice is firm on this price and won't go lower.  Rather than risking further negotiation and potentially going back and forth for several more rounds, I'm going to accept this offer.  It's still well within my budget and a significant savings compared to buying from John."
