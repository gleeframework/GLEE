Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. 
* **Open to negotiation:** This signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This gives Bob some leverage and makes him more likely to accept a deal. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 allows me to walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $9,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **John provides a safety net:**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm dropping the price to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my offer is fair.
* **Creating urgency:**  By stating ""Let me know what you think"", I'm gently pushing Bob to make a decision and avoid a potential deadlock. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  $11,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I get a reasonable return on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still looking to keep my spending within my budget. Would you consider $10,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $10,500 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer, it's not enough for me to accept.
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 allows me to confidently reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:** There's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially since he's shown a willingness to negotiate. I believe I can get a price closer to my desired range if I continue the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer who is also interested in purchasing the product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm raising the price slightly from my previous offer but still trying to be reasonable. 
* **Creating urgency:** I'm mentioning another buyer to subtly pressure Bob to make a decision.
* **Final offer:**  This statement emphasizes my commitment to this price and reduces the likelihood of further negotiation.
* **Still above my minimum:** $11,500 is still above my minimum, ensuring I get a good deal. 

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards a decision while still securing a price closer to my desired range."
