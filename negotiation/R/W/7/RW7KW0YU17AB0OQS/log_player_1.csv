Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm intrigued by the product, $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer you $1600000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is lower than my initial offer, I'd like to counter with a higher price. However, I also need to consider the risk of losing Bob as a potential buyer and the guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.
