"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm intrigued by the product, $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer you $1600000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1600000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1800000 is closer to my range, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1700000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's try to close this deal.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
