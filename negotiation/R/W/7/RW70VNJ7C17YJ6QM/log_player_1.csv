This offer starts at a price that's higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses the value of the product to you, which might incentivize Bob to come closer to your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to what he values the product at, it's still significantly lower than what I need. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $9,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I can do $8,750. Can you meet me there?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

While I'm getting closer to Bob's price,  I'm still not satisfied with his offer. I will counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to reach an agreement that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to come down a little further, to $8,900. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let's make this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but I think we can do even better. I can do $8,750. This is my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal.

Bob is firm on his offer, and although it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me.  Rather than continue to negotiate and potentially risk losing both Bob and John, I'm going to sell the product to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
