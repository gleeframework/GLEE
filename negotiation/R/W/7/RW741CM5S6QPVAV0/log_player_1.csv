"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it's well worth the price considering its potential value to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  I'm including a message explaining the value proposition, appealing to Bob's business sense.
* **Setting the Stage:** This high starting point sets the tone for a back-and-forth negotiation, allowing me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Safety Net:** I can always go to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).**  
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going.** I have 10 rounds, and I'm not in a rush to settle for a price below my minimum threshold. 
* **Counteroffering is a strategic move.**  I can use this opportunity to test Bob's limits and potentially reach a higher price point. 
* **Selling to John remains an option if the negotiation fails.** I have a secure alternative, so I can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a substantial return on your investment. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Strategically:** I'm lowering my price, but only slightly. This shows flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing a good return on investment.
* **Remaining Firm:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Open to Compromise:**  The message conveys a willingness to negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's commitment to the product and see if he's willing to bridge the gap. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate strategically, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850000. This price is fair and allows us both to walk away with a satisfactory deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer remains significantly below my minimum threshold ($1,000,000).**  
* **Rejecting the offer keeps me in the negotiation.** I still have six rounds left.
* **Counteroffering gives me more leverage.** I can use this opportunity to test Bob's limits further and potentially reach a higher price point.
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  It's a good fallback plan if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer again, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us. However, I'll be cautious not to drop my price too low, as I'm still committed to getting at least $1,000,000 for the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This price is fair to both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to secure a valuable asset.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering to split the difference between my previous offer ($1,050,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a Profit:**  $950,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair solution for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of logic. 
* **Final Push:** I'm making a strong push to close the deal, hoping to avoid further rounds of negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess my strategy.  I still have 5 rounds left, but I'll need to decide whether to continue lowering my price or risk losing the deal and selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).**  While it's closer than before, I'm not willing to settle for less.
* **I have 4 rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to close the deal.**  I can afford to keep negotiating.
* **Counteroffering gives me the opportunity to push for a higher price.**  
* **Selling to John is still a secure backup option.**

**Next Steps:**

I'll continue to counteroffer, aiming to reach a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'll also need to consider the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't progress."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  This is my final offer, and it's up to you to decide.  I'm sure you'll agree that this product is worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making a final push for a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Framing as a Fair Deal:** I'm emphasizing the fairness and value of the price, aiming to convince Bob to accept.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm conveying that this is my final offer, implying that he might miss out if he doesn't accept. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, hoping to increase his desire to acquire it.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely move forward with selling the product to John.  I have only three rounds left, and the potential for a higher price with Bob is shrinking.  It's time to make a calculated decision to maximize my profit."
