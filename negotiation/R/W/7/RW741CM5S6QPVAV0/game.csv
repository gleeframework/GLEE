"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1200000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it's well worth the price considering its potential value to your business. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a substantial return on your investment. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850000. This price is fair and allows us both to walk away with a satisfactory deal. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This price is fair to both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to secure a valuable asset.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $975000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  This is my final offer, and it's up to you to decide.  I'm sure you'll agree that this product is worth every penny.",975000.0,Alice,7,
