"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $120. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a little high for me. I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $90? It's a fair compromise, and we can both move forward.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $110. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $110 is still a bit out of my range. Would you consider $100? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to reach a good outcome.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I think we're really close now! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal!",105.0,Alice,7,
