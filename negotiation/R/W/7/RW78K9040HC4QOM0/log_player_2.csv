"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $180.  This is significantly more than you are willing to pay. It's best to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $120. Let me know if that's more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get Alice closer to your target of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a little high for me. I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $90? It's a fair compromise, and we can both move forward."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $110. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price.  You still have a few rounds left to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $110 is still a bit out of my range. Would you consider $100? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to reach a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think we're really close now! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've made significant progress in negotiation, but Alice is still asking for more than you're comfortable with.  You're only two rounds away from running out of time, and while you could continue to negotiate, it's likely Alice won't come down to your desired price.  It's best to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $80 to guarantee you get it at the price you're comfortable with."
