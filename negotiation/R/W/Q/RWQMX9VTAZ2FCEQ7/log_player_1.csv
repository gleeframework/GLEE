Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so this offer leaves some room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're aiming for $1,500,000, so you have room to potentially accept a counteroffer.
* **It's a strong starting point:** It shows you're confident in your product's value and willing to negotiate. 

This strategy allows for flexibility:

* If Bob accepts, you've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, you can see if he'll counter with a price closer to yours.
* You always have the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $1,200,000. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your position:**  It demonstrates you're not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Continue negotiations:**  You can counter with a more reasonable offer and potentially get closer to your desired price.
* **Explore the possibility of a better deal:**  There's still a chance Bob might be willing to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

You should counter with an offer closer to your minimum price, but still lower than your ideal price to leave room for negotiation. A good counteroffer might be around $1,300,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still giving you a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer strikes a balance:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It demonstrates you're not willing to settle for a drastically lower price.
* **Lower than your ideal price:** It allows room for negotiation and encourages Bob to potentially increase his offer.
* **Closer to Bob's perceived value:** $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, increasing the chances of a deal.

**Key points:**

* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  The message highlights the value for both parties, suggesting a win-win situation.
* **Openness to compromise:**  The message conveys a willingness to negotiate further, encouraging Bob to counter with a higher offer. 

This counteroffer positions you to potentially secure a better price while still leaving room for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value in the product, I can't justify going above $1,150,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a better offer than the previous one, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

Given that Bob has shown a reluctance to budge much further, it's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a satisfactory result. Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees you your desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price. 

**Key points:**

* **Guarantee:** Selling to John eliminates the risk of Bob continuing to lowball you.
* **Maximum profit:** You'll receive your ideal price for the product.
* **Time efficiency:** This decision avoids further rounds of negotiation, saving time and effort.

Selling to John is the most logical choice in this scenario, as it ensures you get the best possible outcome."
