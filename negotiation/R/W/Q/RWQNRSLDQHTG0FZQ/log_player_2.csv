"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $110, which is more than Bob is willing to pay.
* **John's price:** $120, which is Bob's maximum.

**Strategy:** 

Reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for a better deal, and Bob has 9 more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob wants to get as close to his $100 target as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffer logic:**  A $5 reduction from Alice's offer is a reasonable starting point. It shows Bob is serious about buying but is also pushing for a better deal.
* **Alice's perspective:**  This offer is within her acceptable range (she's willing to sell for $100) and makes it likely she'll counter-offer rather than immediately reject."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $112, which is higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **John's price:** Still $120, offering a safe alternative.
* **Negotiation strategy:** This round is a test of Alice's flexibility.  By rejecting, Bob demonstrates he's not willing to simply accept her counter-offers. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for compromise, and Bob can still achieve his goal of buying the product for less than $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's previous offer:** $112.
* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible, but still buy the product.
* **Strategy:** A small compromise from Bob's previous offer ($105) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but still pushing for a lower price. 

**Rationale:**

* **Middle Ground:** A $108 offer is a middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest counter-offer. It shows Bob is serious about buying, but still wants a good deal.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  A small shift makes it more likely Alice will counter-offer rather than outright reject.
* **Remaining rounds:** Bob still has time to negotiate further, so there's no need to rush into a deal that's not favorable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $109. This is close to Bob's desired price of $100.
* **John's price:** $120.  
* **Negotiation progress:**  Alice has demonstrated flexibility by dropping her price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Bob might get a lower price, but the risk is that Alice might reject further counter-offers.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $109 is the best option.  It achieves Bob's goal of buying the product for less than $120 while also minimizing the risk of failing to reach a deal.  There are only 5 rounds left, and it's becoming less likely to secure a significantly better price."
