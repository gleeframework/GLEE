{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal for something that could significantly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also aims for a price that's beneficial for both parties.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a safety net of selling to John for $8,000."
