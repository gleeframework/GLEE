# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal for something that could significantly benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $12,000 is less than $15,000, saving Bob $3,000.
* **The product is worth more to Bob than Alice:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, while Alice values it at $8,000. This means Bob is getting a good deal, even at $12,000."
