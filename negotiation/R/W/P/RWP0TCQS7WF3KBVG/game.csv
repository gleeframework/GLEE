"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and worth more than $10000 to us. Considering its value and the fact that it's worth the same to you, I'd like to propose an offer of $15000 for it.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the product is worth $10000 to me, I'm willing to pay $11000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. I am willing to lower my asking price to $13500 for the product. This is still above the product's worth to me, but I believe it presents a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $13500 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This would be a good deal for both of us. ",12000.0,Bob,4,
