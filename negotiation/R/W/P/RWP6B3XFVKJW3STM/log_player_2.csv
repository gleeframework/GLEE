"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. Considering your willingness to pay $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than buying from John. While there's potential to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially driving the price closer to John's offer makes accepting the current offer the most logical choice."
