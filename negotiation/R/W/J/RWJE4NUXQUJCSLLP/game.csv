"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $8000 for it, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I can offer, considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is my absolute maximum.  I understand this is a valuable product for you, but it's also important that we find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
