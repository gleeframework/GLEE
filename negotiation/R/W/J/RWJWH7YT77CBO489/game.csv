"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be worth $8,000 to me.  Would you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is far too low for me. This product has a lot of value that I think justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $18,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you do $11,000?  That's a reasonable compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, this product is worth a significant investment. How about $16,000? That's a final offer from my side.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate that you're trying to find a middle ground.  While $16,000 is still a bit much, I'm willing to stretch my budget to $12,000 if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,6,
