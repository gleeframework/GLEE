"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be worth $8,000 to me.  Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is far too low for me. This product has a lot of value that I think justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $18,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you do $11,000?  That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to a reasonable offer, I'm still losing a significant amount compared to John's standing offer. I'll try to negotiate Bob a bit higher, but I'm getting closer to my walk-away point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, this product is worth a significant investment. How about $16,000? That's a final offer from my side."",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm making it clear this is my final offer to signal that I'm serious about the value and unwilling to go much lower.  $16,000 is still a profit for me if Bob accepts, but I'm prepared to walk away and take John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate that you're trying to find a middle ground.  While $16,000 is still a bit much, I'm willing to stretch my budget to $12,000 if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price.  He's increasing his offer in small increments, and I've already given a ""final offer.""  Selling to John guarantees the best outcome for me at this point."
