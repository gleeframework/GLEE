This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price:** You're getting the product for $40,000 less than John's offer and a significant discount from Alice's initial asking price.
* **Time:**  You've negotiated well, but there's a risk Alice will walk away if you push further, especially since she mentioned another buyer. 
* **Finality:** Accepting now provides certainty and avoids the potential of a stalled negotiation."
