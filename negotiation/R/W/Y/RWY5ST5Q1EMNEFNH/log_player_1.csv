"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm willing to risk a few rounds to try and get closer to my target of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, however. How about $1,050,000? This price still gives you a significant value, and it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer,  $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get him up to $1,000,000.  If this fails, I'm likely going to sell to John, as the risk of further haggling isn't worth the potential gain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $950,000 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  $1,000,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product. It's your last chance to make a deal before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer, but his offer is still below my minimum.  I've had several rounds of negotiations and haven't been able to reach my desired price.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high. I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I get a reasonable price and avoid further haggling."
