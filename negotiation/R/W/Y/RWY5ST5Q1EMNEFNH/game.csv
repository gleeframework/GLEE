,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, however. How about $1,050,000? This price still gives you a significant value, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $950,000 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  $1,000,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product. It's your last chance to make a deal before I have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
