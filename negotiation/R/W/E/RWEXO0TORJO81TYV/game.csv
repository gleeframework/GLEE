"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $105?  It's closer to my budget, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product for $107.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your effort to find a price we can both agree on.  I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $105.  I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy the product at that price.",105.0,Bob,6,
