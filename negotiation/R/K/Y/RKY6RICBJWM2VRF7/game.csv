"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? That's still a great price for a product worth more to you than that. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I see the value in the product, $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? That would make it possible for me to close the deal today.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
