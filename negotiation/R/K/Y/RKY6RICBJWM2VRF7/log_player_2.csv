"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than our maximum budget ($8,000) to give us room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely and suggests the counter-offer is a ""fair price,"" aiming to maintain a positive negotiation tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? That's still a great price for a product worth more to you than that. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is still above our maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're only in round 3, and there's still time to negotiate further. Alice seems willing to move on price, so we can try to push for a better deal. 
* **John as Backup:**  We have the safety net of buying from John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I see the value in the product, $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? That would make it possible for me to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  We're increasing our offer from $6,000 to $7,000, showing Alice we're willing to move closer to her price.
* **Below Budget, Above Midpoint:** This offer stays below our $8,000 maximum while moving above the midpoint ($7,500) between our initial offer and Alice's counter. This can signal a serious attempt to find a compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""closing the deal today,"" we introduce a subtle sense of urgency, which might encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice's offer of $8,000 matches our maximum budget. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:**  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and we risk losing the deal altogether.
* **John's Price:**  We can buy from John for the same price, so there's no advantage to delaying further."
