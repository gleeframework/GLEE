Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,500,000 is still out of my price range.  How about we split the difference and I offer $1,250,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.
