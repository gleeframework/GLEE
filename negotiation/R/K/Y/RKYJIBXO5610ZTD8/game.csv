"Hi Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To move this forward, how about we meet closer to the middle at $1,500,000? I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,500,000 is still out of my price range.  How about we split the difference and I offer $1,250,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
