Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which still leaves a comfortable profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a solid return on my investment while also providing you with a substantial profit. What do you think?
