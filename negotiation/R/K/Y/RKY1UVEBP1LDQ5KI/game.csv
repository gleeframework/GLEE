"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which still leaves a comfortable profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a considerable return on your investment. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a solid return on my investment while also providing you with a substantial profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
