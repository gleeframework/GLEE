"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $110. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards a price that works for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counteroffer significantly lowers the price, aiming to get closer to a fair deal. By starting lower, we leave room for negotiation while still staying above Alice's perceived value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $90 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $100?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further. There's no rush to accept this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $90 is a significant drop. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

We're nudging closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to compromise but still aiming for a good deal. This keeps the negotiation moving while staying within budget."
