"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering the market value.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is quite high, and $7,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,000. How about we meet at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market conditions.",8500.0,Bob,4,
