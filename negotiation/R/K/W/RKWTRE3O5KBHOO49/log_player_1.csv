"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer.  If he rejects this offer, we can start the back-and-forth process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  I have 9 rounds left and can always fall back on selling to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer of $170 and Bob's offer of $140. It's also still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, which keeps me in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $145. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option of selling to John for $150. There are still 6 rounds left, giving me time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to stick with my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and I'm confident that he'll accept this offer.  If not, I'll still have the option of selling to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has consistently rejected offers that are near my minimum acceptable price. I've already made significant concessions.  At this point, with only four rounds remaining, it's more likely that Bob will continue to lowball me.  Rather than risk further haggling and potentially losing out on a guaranteed $150, I'll sell the product to John."
