Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm offering it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 180}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in this product but need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is still a bit too high. Let's try $120. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to accept and close the deal with him."
