"Hi Alice, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in this product but need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is still a bit too high. Let's try $120. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Bob,4,
