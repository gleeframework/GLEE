# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm offering it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in this product but need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
