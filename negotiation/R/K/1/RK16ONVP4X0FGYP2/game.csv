"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the value of this product is quite high for me. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original price, so how about $1,300,000? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
