"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I understand this product has value, but I'm only willing to pay $850000.  Let's start our negotiation with this counteroffer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $850000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $875000. This feels like a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with a positive outcome.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  $875000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price that reflects the true value this product brings to you.  I'm willing to come down to $890000.  This is my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen.",890000.0,Alice,5,
