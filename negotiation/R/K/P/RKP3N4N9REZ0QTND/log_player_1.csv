{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about $12,500?  That leaves some room for negotiation, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $12,300, but that's my final offer.  I believe this price is fair given the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12300}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $13,000, it's only $50 less than my last offer and it's getting late in the negotiation. It's better to secure the sale and avoid risking losing Bob completely, especially since John is waiting in the wings with a lower offer."
