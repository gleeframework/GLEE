"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to see if you can get a better price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and encourages her to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price, and I'm getting close to my target.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate and getting a better price is outweighed by the possibility of Alice walking away or the deal falling apart."
