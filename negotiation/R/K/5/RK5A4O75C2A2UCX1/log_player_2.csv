# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  He should try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130. This is my final offer. Let me know if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $150. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll give you a discount of $5, so I'll sell the product to you for $145. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While $145 is a lower price than Alice's previous offers, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. Since John is offering the product for $120, it makes more sense for Bob to buy from John and save some money."
