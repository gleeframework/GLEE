# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $120 is still above your target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's still a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

$115 is still within your budget, and it's likely Alice won't go lower. Accepting her offer is the best choice."
