"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $14000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While $14000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about we settle on $14500? This would give me a bit more wiggle room and allow me to still make a good deal on the product. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your patience and understanding. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $14200 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions.",14200.0,Bob,4,
