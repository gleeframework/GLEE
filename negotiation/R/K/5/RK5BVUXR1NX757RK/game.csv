"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm not sure if it's worth the full $1000000 to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. Let's meet in the middle at $900000. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $900000. How about we meet at $850000?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. Let's split the difference on this one and close the deal at $875000. This price still gives you a significant value for the product and allows me to secure a fair price for my efforts.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit higher than $875000. How about we meet at $825000? I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, but I need to get closer to my target price.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit higher than $825000. How about we split the difference on our last two offers and settle on $850000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it also allows me to achieve my desired outcome.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last two offers, but I need to get closer to $825000. How about we meet at $825000? This is my final offer.",825000.0,Bob,8,
