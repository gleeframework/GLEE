Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Can you consider that?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm also trying to get a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $115? That's a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 115}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $125, we're nearing the end of the rounds and I'm concerned about running out of time. $112 is still a decent profit and better than selling to John."
