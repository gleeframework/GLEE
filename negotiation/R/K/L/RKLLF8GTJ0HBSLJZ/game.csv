"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential benefits for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is far above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 undervalues its true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to go with another seller if we can't reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
