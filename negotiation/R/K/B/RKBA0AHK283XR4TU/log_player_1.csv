"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a competitive price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer meets my minimum price, but I already have a guaranteed buyer in John. There's no need to negotiate further with Bob when I can sell the product for the same price to John without risk."
