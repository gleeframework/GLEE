Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.  
* **High Starting Point:** $19,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but ensures you're aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest,"" you subtly create a sense of demand, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style or how much you want a quick sale, you could adjust the price and message accordingly."
