Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $9000, but this is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and she's stated it's her final offer.  You've already made several counteroffers, and it's unlikely she'll budge further. To avoid potentially wasting more time, it's best to buy the product from John for $8,000."
