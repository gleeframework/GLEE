"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but still below what the product is worth to Bob. This allows for negotiation and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  $90 is still a good offer, but I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $100.  How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm trying to split the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still keeping a price point closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $92.50 is a more reasonable price for me. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come down to $92.50, which is only $2.50 away from my ideal price.  It's a good deal, and it's likely he won't come down much further.  It's better than selling to John for $80."
