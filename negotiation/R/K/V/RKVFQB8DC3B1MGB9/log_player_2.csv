"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You're indifferent to buying from Alice or John since both offer the product at $100.  The prompt specifically states your goal is to save as much money as possible, but there's no way to save money in this scenario.  Since you can buy from John, there's no need to interact with Alice."
