Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts on the price."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is designed to be open-ended. Bob's response will reveal how interested he is and might give us clues about his perceived value.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts the $20,000, we significantly exceed both our minimum price and his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move. We need to be prepared to adjust our price based on Bob's response and negotiation tactics."
