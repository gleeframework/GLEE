"Thanks for the offer Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in lower than $9,000.  Would you be willing to do $8,500?  I think that's a fair price that benefits us both.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9250.0,Alice,3,
