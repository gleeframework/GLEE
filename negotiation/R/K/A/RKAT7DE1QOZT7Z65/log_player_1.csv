{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer sets the bar high, leaving room for negotiation but still ensuring a profit above the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident Bob will counter-offer, and I'm prepared to negotiate until we reach a mutually beneficial price. However, I also have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter-offer with a higher price, hoping to reach a middle ground.  However, I'll be ready to sell to John if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 800000}
