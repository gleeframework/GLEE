``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $15,000 and gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'm hoping to get as close to $18,000 as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to meet in the middle and secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would ideally like a bit more, $16,500 is a good deal for me. It's more than what John is offering and closer to my desired price. It's time to secure the sale and move on."
