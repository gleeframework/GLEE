"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is higher than my current budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount of $50,000 from my initial price, so I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you a discount of $25,000 from my previous offer, so I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer you $1,075,000 for the product. This represents a significant commitment on my part and is the highest I can go at this time. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your commitment to making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 6-month warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which will provide you with additional value beyond the purchase price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000, but I'd like to discuss the details of the warranty and maintenance package with you.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
