"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Would you be open to $100?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $150.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125?  It's still a fair price for the quality of this product. "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about $115? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to my desired price point. While I would prefer a bit more, accepting now ensures a sale above my minimum of $100.  The risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower offer, or Bob might walk away.  Selling to John for $100 would be less profitable at this stage."
