"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $8,000, it's still significantly less than what I'm aiming for. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $9,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gets us closer to finding a solution."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,000. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I've reached the point where I'm not confident I can get much higher. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000."
