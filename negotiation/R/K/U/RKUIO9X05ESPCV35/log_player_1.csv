{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the asking price of $1,350,000. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further!"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we have a strong alternative buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This allows us to start negotiations higher. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $1,350,000 provides some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob can make the offer more appealing.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her price slightly in further negotiations. The key is to aim for a price that maximizes profit while still remaining attractive enough for Bob to accept."
