"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my asking price. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
