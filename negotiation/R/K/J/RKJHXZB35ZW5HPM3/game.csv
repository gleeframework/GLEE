"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's worth discussing a price that's mutually beneficial for both of us. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest,  $850,000 is a little too steep for my budget.  Could you do $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $825,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle again.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close. How about we split the difference between our last offers and call it a deal at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I was hoping we could meet at $800,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I can do $820,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",820000.0,Alice,7,
