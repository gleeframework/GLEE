{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $1,000,000, I need to get as close to my $1,200,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering $1,100,000 leaves space for counteroffers and negotiation without being unrealistic.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for both parties.

**Next steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response. 
* If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and potentially counter back. 
*  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll move on to John to secure the $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, $1,050,000 is still significantly less than my target price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

**Next steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target. 
* I'll try to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. 
* If negotiations fail, I will move on to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept right now.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal happen.  This price still reflects the true value of the product, and it allows for a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving halfway from my initial offer of $1,100,000 to his offer of $1,050,000.  This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize that even $1,100,000 is still a fair price for the product's value.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and collaborative approach to keep the negotiations open.

**Next steps:**

* I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* If he rejects, I will re-evaluate my options and potentially move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1,100,000. My final offer is $1,075,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still $25,000 short of my minimum valuation of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of losing John's deal:**  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate with Bob could make me miss out on the secure $1,200,000 offer from John.
* **Potential for further counteroffers:**  If I reject Bob's offer, it's possible he may come back with an even better offer.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob one last counteroffer, this time closer to his $1,075,000 but still above my minimum.
* **Final decision:** If this counteroffer fails, I'll accept John's offer to guarantee my minimum profit."
