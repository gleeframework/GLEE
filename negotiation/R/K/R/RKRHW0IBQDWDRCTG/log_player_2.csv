"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $170.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and higher than what John is offering.  It makes the most sense to buy from John for $100."
