{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's a good midpoint between your minimum acceptable price and Bob's potential value. It leaves room for negotiation and allows for a win-win situation for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit low for me.  How about $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for your offer. I would like to counter with $115 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $115 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than selling to John, and it shows Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'll accept this offer."
