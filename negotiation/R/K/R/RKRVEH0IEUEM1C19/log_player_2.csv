{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $85 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that he is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate.  A $10 reduction is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his target. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible. He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise but still aiming for a lower price. A $10 increase in his offer is a reasonable step while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is a good offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his target. He has 5 rounds remaining and has successfully lowered the price from $100 to $95, so there's still potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. He's increased his offer from $80 to $85, which is a reasonable compromise.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but still wants a good price. He's also keeping in mind that he has John as a backup option if this deal falls through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $92, which is just $2 more than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob, considering he can buy it from John for $100. With only three rounds remaining, there's a chance Alice might reject his next offer. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price slightly above his ideal but still within his budget."
