Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $10,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $10,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down, while still ensuring you make more than your minimum. 
* **Confidence:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can make Bob more receptive to the higher price. 

It's important to remember that this is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial price."
