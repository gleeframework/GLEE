{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit above your $10,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows you're serious about selling to Bob:** By offering a price, you're indicating you're open to a deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still potentially get a better price. By rejecting his offer, you can try to push for a higher price in the next round.  You're in a strong negotiating position since you have a backup buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is reasonable:** $11,000 is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  You're showing you're open to negotiation and still interested in a deal with Bob.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:**  You're framing the price as being beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $10,800? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,800 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While you could try to push for a bit more, the risk of him walking away is high, and you would then be left with selling to John for $10,000. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees you a decent profit and a successful negotiation."
