"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $20,000 represents the upper end of its value, $12,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I understand you value this product highly, but I'm only willing to go up to $14,000.  If we can agree on that, we can close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
