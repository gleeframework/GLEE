"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? That would be a fair compromise, and I believe you'd still be getting a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
