Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **My Value:** My minimum acceptable price is $10,000.
* **John's Value:**  I have a guaranteed backup offer of $10,000 from John.

By offering $14,000, I am:

* **Maximizing my potential profit:**  I get $4,000 more than my minimum, which is a significant gain.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Bob still has a $1,000 incentive to accept the offer, which increases the likelihood of a deal. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and maximizing the chances of a successful transaction with Bob."
