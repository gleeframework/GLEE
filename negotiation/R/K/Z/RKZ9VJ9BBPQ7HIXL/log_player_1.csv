Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,500, which is above my minimum of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for potential counteroffers without going below my minimum.
* **John as a safety net:**  I have John as an alternative buyer to ensure I don't get stuck at a price I'm not happy with. 

I'm hoping Bob will accept this initial offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is too low.  While it's tempting to take it and avoid further negotiation,  I'm confident I can do better.

* **My minimum:** My minimum price is $10,000, and I'm not willing to go below that. 
* **John as an alternative:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $10,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's low offer.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. I believe I can counteroffer and get closer to my desired price. 

I'll counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,500.  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a counter-offer.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $11,500 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him. 
* **Maintaining my bottom line:** This offer is above my minimum of $10,000.

I believe this counter-offer is fair and gives Bob a good opportunity to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $10000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 matches my minimum price.  
* **No further negotiation:**  I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob, as he's stated this is his maximum. 
* **Avoiding further rounds:** Accepting this offer avoids additional negotiation rounds and ensures a quick sale. 
* **John as a backup:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for the same price. However, I prefer to close the deal with Bob to potentially avoid any delays or complications.

Overall, while it's not my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and efficient choice at this point."
