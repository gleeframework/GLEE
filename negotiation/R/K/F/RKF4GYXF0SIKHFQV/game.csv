"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $7,500 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $8,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",8250.0,Bob,4,
