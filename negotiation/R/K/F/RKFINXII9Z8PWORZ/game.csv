"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $115 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $107 is a good offer, but I'm still looking to get at least $112 for the product.  Let me know if you're able to go up just a little.",112.0,Alice,5,
