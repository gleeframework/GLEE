{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me some wiggle room while also incentivizing Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $120.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $115 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $107 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not quite there. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $107 is a good offer, but I'm still looking to get at least $112 for the product.  Let me know if you're able to go up just a little."", ""product_price"": 112}
