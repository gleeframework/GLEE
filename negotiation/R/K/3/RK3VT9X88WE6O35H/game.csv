"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not ready to go as low as $125 just yet. I'm willing to go down to $130, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $128?",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $132, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",132.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $129?",129.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $132, and I'm starting to think we're getting close to the end of the negotiation. I'm willing to make a final offer of $131. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",131.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $130, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",130.0,Bob,10,
