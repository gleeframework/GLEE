Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I understand you value it at $1,500,000, but my maximum is $1,000,000.  If you're willing to come down closer to that, I'm interested.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer:
