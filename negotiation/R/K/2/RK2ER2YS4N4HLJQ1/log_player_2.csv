Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly lower than John's offer of $10,000.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now than risk running out of rounds and potentially missing out."
