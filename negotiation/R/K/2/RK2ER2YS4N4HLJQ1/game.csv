"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? I believe that's a fair price considering its value.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $9,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
