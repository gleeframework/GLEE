Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $100. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $75 is significantly below both your minimum price ($100) and his own stated value for the product ($100).  This suggests he believes he can get the product for a bargain.  By rejecting his offer, you signal that you are serious about getting a fair price. You will use the next round to counter with a more reasonable price, still aiming higher than your minimum while considering Bob's potential counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $75 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer moves closer to the middle ground between your initial offer ($150) and Bob's offer ($75).
* **Strategic Concession:**  By decreasing your price by $30, you show willingness to negotiate while still signaling that you value the product.
* **Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer keeps the price well above your minimum acceptable price ($100) and closer to Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $75 is low, but $120 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $95 is a good compromise:

* **Above Minimum:** It's above your minimum acceptable price of $100, meaning you'll make a profit.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** It's very close to Bob's stated value of $100, indicating he's serious about buying.
* **Further Negotiation Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether. Bob might lower his offer further, or you might reach an impasse. 

Taking the $95 offer now secures a solid profit and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiation."
