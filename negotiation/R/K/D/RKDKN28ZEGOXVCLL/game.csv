"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I understand the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that reflects its value while still being advantageous for both of us. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,200,000.  This price ensures a substantial profit for you while still being significantly higher than my alternative offer. I believe this is a fair and attractive proposition.  Please consider my offer carefully.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
