"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  That starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, however $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I could do $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $700,000 is too far off from what I had in mind. I can go down to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your limit, but it's still a bit rich for me.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
