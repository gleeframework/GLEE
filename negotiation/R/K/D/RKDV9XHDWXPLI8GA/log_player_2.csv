"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. Given its value to you, I believe this price represents an excellent opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice. Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. Given my budget, I can offer $12,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you and the market conditions, I am willing to negotiate further. My revised offer for the product is $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer of $14,000. While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, it's unlikely Bob will get a better price than this.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $2,000 compared to buying from John."
