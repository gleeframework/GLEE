"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. I believe this price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000 to find common ground. This offer reflects a significant investment on my end, but I believe in finding a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This price acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept considering the product's worth.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
