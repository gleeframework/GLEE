Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept considering the product's worth.

While Alice has lowered the price again, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. At this point, it's best to go with John's offer and secure the product for a price within my budget."
