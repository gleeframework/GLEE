{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges Bob's perceived value of the product, making it more persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I want to try and squeeze more out of the deal.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. How about we meet in the middle again, at $8,750? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price,  $8,750 is still a good deal for me and a decent profit.  It's also likely that Bob won't budge further, so accepting his offer seems like the best move at this point."
