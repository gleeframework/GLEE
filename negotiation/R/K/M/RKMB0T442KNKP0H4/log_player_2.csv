Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move, aiming to quickly gauge her willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can still get a good deal, even if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly at my maximum budget.  It's a good deal, and there's no reason to risk further negotiation.  Buying from Alice now avoids the potential for further haggling and the risk that John might change his price."
