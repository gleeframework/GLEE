"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money and the product is worth $80 to him. Alice's offer of $90 is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $75, which is still a decent price for him (since the product is worth $80 to him) but also gives him some room to negotiate further.  He's starting with a lower price than Alice's initial offer, aiming to get closer to his desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  There are still rounds left, so rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering Alice $80, which is his maximum price. This is the price he's willing to pay, and also the price he can buy it for from John.  He's hoping Alice will accept, but if she doesn't, he'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating or buy from John."
