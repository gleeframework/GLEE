{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  We need to offer a price lower than his valuation but high enough to maximize your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly.

**Why not ask for more?**

While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, closing the deal with Bob quickly might be preferable to a potentially longer process with John."
