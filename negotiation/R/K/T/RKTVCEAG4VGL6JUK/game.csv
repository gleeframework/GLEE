"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8,200. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,600?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $8,400. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,400 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer $7,800 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7,800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8100.0,Alice,7,
