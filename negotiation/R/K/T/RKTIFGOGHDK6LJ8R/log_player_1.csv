{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts by acknowledging the product's value to me while also hinting at its value to Bob.  The price is above Bob's perceived value, but it's lower than what I'd get from John, leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise without risking a deal that's less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, but I'm not going to lose the deal just yet.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's closer to my desired price point."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be more reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I'll make a final counteroffer to try and secure a deal closer to my desired price. If it's rejected, I'll go with John."
