"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This way we both get a fair deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be more reasonable for me.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,200 as my final offer. This is the best I can do, and it's still a good deal for you. If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to go with another buyer.",10200.0,Alice,5,
