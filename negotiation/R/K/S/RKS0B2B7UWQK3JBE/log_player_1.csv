Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **John's Offer:** John acts as your safety net, guaranteeing you $80 if Bob refuses.

By offering the product at $100, you aim for a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly less than his perceived value.
* **Profitable for you:** It's well above your minimum acceptable price and secures a $20 profit.

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
