"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",780000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $780,000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $815,000? This would give you a good price while ensuring I get a fair value for the product.",815000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $815,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $805,000. This is a very fair price and will allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you say?",805000.0,Bob,4,
