"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which is the maximum value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $13500 is closer, but I'm still only able to go up to $12500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
