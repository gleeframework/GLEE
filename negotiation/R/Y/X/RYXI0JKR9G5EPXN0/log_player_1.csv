Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $120, but it's also below my minimum of $150. This leaves room for negotiation, which could lead to a final price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $125 is above Bob's valuation, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While I value your offer, I'm not able to go that low just yet. How about $130? It's still a great deal, and we can finalize the sale quickly."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $127.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $127.50 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal. Given the opportunity to sell to John for $150, I'll take that option.  The potential for further negotiation with Bob is there, but it's not guaranteed. It's better to secure a sale at my minimum price rather than risk a lower price or an extended negotiation."
