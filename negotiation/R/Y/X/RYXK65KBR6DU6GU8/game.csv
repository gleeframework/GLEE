"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $13,250? This would give you a great deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $13,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
