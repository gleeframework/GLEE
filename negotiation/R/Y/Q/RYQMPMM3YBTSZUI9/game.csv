"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500. Is that something you'd be interested in?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down Alice, I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and meet at $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $6,750. I'm willing to go a bit higher, to $7,200. This is my final offer in this direction. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $7,200 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you consider $6,900? This is a fair offer reflecting the value I see in the product.",6900.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $7,100, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer.",7100.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're close, but that gap is still a bit too wide for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $7,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if this works for you.",7000.0,Bob,8,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to accept $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",7200.0,Alice,9,
