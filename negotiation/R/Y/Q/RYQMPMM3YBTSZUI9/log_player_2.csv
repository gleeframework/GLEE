Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to accept $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $7,100, and has even gone back up to $7,200. It's unlikely she'll go lower in the next round.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $8,000 is the best financial decision."
