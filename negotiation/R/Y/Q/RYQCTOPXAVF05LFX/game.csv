"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7,000 is too far below what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer.  How about $8,500? This would allow us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,125?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal!",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $7,900? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,000.  This would be a win-win for both of us.  I'm willing to go no lower than this, so let's close the deal!",8000.0,Alice,7,
