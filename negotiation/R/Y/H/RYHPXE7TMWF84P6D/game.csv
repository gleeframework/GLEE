"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet at $78? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $78 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more to make this work for me. How about $82? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $82. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $80, which would be $79. Can you consider that?",79.0,Bob,6,
