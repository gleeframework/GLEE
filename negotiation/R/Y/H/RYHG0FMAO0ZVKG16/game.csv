"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm asking for $180 for it. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $180 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $60 is way below what the product is worth. I understand it's not my initial asking price, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair bit closer to your valuation, and it works better for my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? I'm trying to be as flexible as possible, and this price would work for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, I've got another offer for $80.  Would you be willing to match that?  If not, I'm afraid I'll have to go with the other offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
