Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While knowing Bob's valuation is helpful, it's best to start negotiations with a price closer to your desired outcome. This leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""significant value"" and ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of value and urgency without revealing John's guaranteed purchase.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" suggests flexibility and openness to counter-offers from Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable compared to his own valuation."
