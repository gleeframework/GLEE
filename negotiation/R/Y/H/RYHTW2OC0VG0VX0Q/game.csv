"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,11000.0
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11000, which is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and it's still within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but I was thinking we could meet somewhere in between $9500 and $10000. How about $10250? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $10250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and it's the highest price I'm willing to pay.",9000.0,Bob,6,,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $9500? It's still a compromise, but it's a bit higher than your last offer.",9500.0,Alice,7,,

"I'm not willing to go above $9000, and I think $9500 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a final offer of $9000. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",9000.0,Bob,8,,
