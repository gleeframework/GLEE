"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get the product for a slightly lower price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to a range where I save significantly, while still being a potentially attractive offer for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice meeting in the middle at $7,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a good balance between getting a discount and securing the product. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
