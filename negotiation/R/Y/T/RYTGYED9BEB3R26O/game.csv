"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  Given my assessment of the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  Let's try to reach an agreement that's fair to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
