"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you. I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product, as I believe it holds potential value for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would allow both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
