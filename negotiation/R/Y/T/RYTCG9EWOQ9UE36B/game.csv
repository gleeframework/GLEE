"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950000 is still a bit high for me.  Given its unique qualities, I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
