Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is a significant discount from your initial offer and still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts.
