"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is a significant discount from your initial offer and still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,110,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your understanding of the product's value. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,095,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1095000.0,Alice,5,
