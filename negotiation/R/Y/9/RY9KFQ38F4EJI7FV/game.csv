"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me is significantly higher. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run. How about $10,500? It's still a great price considering what I could get from someone else. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Can we make a deal at that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
