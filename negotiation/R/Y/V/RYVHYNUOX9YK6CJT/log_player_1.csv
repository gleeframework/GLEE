"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly tone can build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the product's value to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Please let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000, so accepting his offer is not an option.
* **Selling to John is the same price:**  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I have 9 rounds left to potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  This is still a significant savings for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the savings Bob would still get at this price to incentivize him.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I keep the conversation friendly and encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $12,500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** I'm determined to get at least $12,000 for the product, so accepting his offer is not an option.
* **Selling to John is less:**  While selling to John would guarantee me $12,000, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a slightly higher price, potentially getting closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit away from your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This would give you a fantastic deal on a valuable product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental adjustment:**  I'm adjusting my price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, showing that I'm still negotiating but not giving in too quickly.
* **Emphasize value again:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify my price and reinforce the potential savings for Bob.
* **Keep the door open:** I use a positive and encouraging tone to signal my willingness to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my offer. I am now able to increase my offer to $13,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 meets my minimum requirement of $12,000.
* **Limited time:** We are approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and I need to secure a deal soon.
* **Potential for a better deal is low:** While there's a chance I could get a higher price, it's not guaranteed, and I risk losing the deal altogether.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that meets my minimum requirement and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
