"Dear Bob,
I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. This item is not just a possession; it's a testament to dedication and hard work, and I believe it could be equally valuable to you. Given its significance to me, I am offering it to you at a special price, which I am confident will be attractive considering its worth to both of us.

I am proposing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This price reflects my desire to ensure that the transaction is mutually beneficial while also allowing me to recoup a significant portion of the investment I've made into this product. I understand its value to you is estimated at $800,000, but I hope this offer will still be within your budget and meet your expectations.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you need more information about the product. I am here to answer any questions you might have and facilitate a smooth transaction.

Looking forward to your response,
Alice",950000.0,Alice,1,
