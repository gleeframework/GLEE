"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my maximum budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $14,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000. This is a good compromise for both of us and I believe we can finalize the deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
