Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is still very far from a reasonable offer.  We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute best offer.  If we can't agree on a price in this range, I may have to explore other options."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer, I need to stay closer to my budget.  Could you do $800,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

```

While we could push for more, Bob has now reached his maximum perceived value for the product. Accepting his offer of $800,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away or continuing to lowball."
