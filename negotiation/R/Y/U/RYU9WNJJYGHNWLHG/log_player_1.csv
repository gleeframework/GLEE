Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a price that is above my minimum threshold of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher profit. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, there is a possibility he will accept this offer.  If he rejects it, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

While Bob's offer is above my minimum threshold of $10,000, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm offering to sell the product for $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price will be appealing to Bob and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but there's no room for further negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000 to avoid the risk of further negotiations that might result in an even lower price or a stalemate."
