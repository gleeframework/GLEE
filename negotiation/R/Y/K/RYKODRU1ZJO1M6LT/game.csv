"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you and leaves me some room to work with.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further.  While $115 is getting closer to where I want to be, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you consider $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $112. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",112.0,Alice,5,
