``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, giving you room to negotiate, but still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value for the product. I'll reject it and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $980,000 still falls short of what I believe the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle at $1,015,000. It's a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1015000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $1,015,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is getting tedious. It's clear he's not willing to go much higher, and I'm running the risk of getting stuck at a price lower than I'd prefer. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal and ensures a quick and easy sale."
