"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can go up to $925,000. This is a strong offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand your budget constraints, $925,000 is still below the minimum I can accept. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,000,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair solution for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
