"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120. 
* Alice's offer is $100, which is a good deal but you can do better.
* You can buy the product from John for $120, which is your maximum price.

Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John as a backup."
