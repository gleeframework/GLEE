"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still too high for Bob. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  Since he has a backup option with John at $1,500,000, there's no immediate pressure to accept.  He's better off trying to get a better deal with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,150,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is my last counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,225,000, which is within Bob's budget and closer to his target price. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer, and he'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is the most strategic move to secure the product within his budget."
