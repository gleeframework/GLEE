Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Considering its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have a guaranteed buyer in John,  Bob doesn't know this. Highlighting the product's desirability might incentivize him to accept a higher price. 
* **Politeness and Clarity:** The message is polite and clearly states your intentions, making it more likely for Bob to engage in good faith."
