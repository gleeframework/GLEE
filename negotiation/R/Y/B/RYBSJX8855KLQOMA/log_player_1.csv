Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is designed to be open-ended, inviting Bob to share his thoughts and potentially counter-offer. This helps you understand how interested he is and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have the security of John's offer ($15,000). This knowledge empowers you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob."
