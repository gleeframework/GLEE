"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think we can work something out.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and sell it to me for $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise. It's a great price for the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. Can you consider that price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still too far from where I need to be. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $8,900. This is a very fair price considering the value you'll be getting, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final concession, Alice, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but no further. Can you meet me at that price?",8800.0,Bob,6,
