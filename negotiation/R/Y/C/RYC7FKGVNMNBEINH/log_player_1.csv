{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I can only offer $975,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer, but slowly. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about a higher price. We still have time and the fallback option of John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be upfront â€“ the $975,000 offer is just too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to consider $1,025,000, but that's my absolute bottom line."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** We're sending a strong message that we're not going to go much lower.
* **Small Concession:** We're still showing a willingness to negotiate by dropping the price slightly.
* **Deadline Implication:** By stating our ""bottom line"" we're implying time is running out for Bob to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,025,000. I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,000,000 is a significant amount and a good return on the product, even if it's less than our ideal price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  After 6 rounds, it's likely further negotiation will yield minimal gains. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to push for a higher price with Bob risks him walking away entirely. Accepting now guarantees a good profit."
