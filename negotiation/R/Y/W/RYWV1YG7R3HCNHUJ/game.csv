"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9000, so I'd like to propose $10000. Can you consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11250. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $11250 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
