Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You're aware that Bob values the product at $10,000, giving you a starting point for negotiation.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher than Bob's perceived value, potentially influencing him to accept a higher price.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, ensuring you don't lose out.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This strategy assumes Bob might negotiate. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward if needed, but remain firm on not going below $15,000.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even though you have a backup buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob can be beneficial in the long run."
