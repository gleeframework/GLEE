"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $12000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. Given my financial situation, I am unable to meet the $10500 price point. Could we perhaps negotiate down to $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm offering the product to you for $11000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet the $11000 price point. I would like to propose a final offer of $10000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make one final push, and I'm offering the product to you for $11500. This is my absolute best price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
