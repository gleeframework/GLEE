"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $110, which is more than your maximum.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $100, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer."
