Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($100).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($10).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $100 provides a safety net. This allows you to aim higher with Bob.

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might negotiate for a lower price, but starting high gives you room to maneuver and potentially secure a better deal."
