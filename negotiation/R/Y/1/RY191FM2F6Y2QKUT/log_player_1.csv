Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great value, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $900,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's trying to stay well below his actual budget. It's not worth risking a lower offer in further rounds. John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,000,000 which meets my minimum."
