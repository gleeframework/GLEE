"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $80 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That way, we both get a fair price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet at $85? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go down to $95, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be selling to someone else.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, that's the best I can do.",87.5,Bob,6,
