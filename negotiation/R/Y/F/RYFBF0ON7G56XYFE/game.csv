"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $70 is just not enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm confident you'll find this product worth that price, and it's a good deal for both of us. ",85.0,Alice,5,
