"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still within the range where further negotiation could potentially save Bob money. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer. This price is still within the range where Bob would be willing to purchase the product, while also leaving room for potential negotiation and compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's preferred price, it's still above his target. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to try and push the price down further. There's still room for a counteroffer that could result in a better deal than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's now willing to increase his offer slightly to $1,100,000. This is a compromise from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway. It's still a significant discount from Alice's current offer, and Bob believes there's a good chance Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting very close to John's price of $1,500,000.  It's unlikely that Bob will be able to negotiate further with Alice to get a better price.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept John's offer and avoid any further risk of not getting the product at all."
