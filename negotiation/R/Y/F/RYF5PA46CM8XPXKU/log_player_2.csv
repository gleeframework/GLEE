"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting because it's below your perceived value of $15,000, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating. You have a significant buffer between your maximum price ($15,000) and Alice's offer ($12,000), giving you room to counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is good, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum price,  hopefully encouraging Alice to compromise. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $10,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's still significantly less than your maximum price of $15,000 and a fair middle ground after your previous counteroffer. Accepting this offer saves you $3,500 compared to buying from John, and it avoids the potential risk of further negotiation."
