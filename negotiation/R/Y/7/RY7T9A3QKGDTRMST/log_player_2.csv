{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

{""product_price"": 1200000}

```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Bob has 5 more rounds to negotiate and can still try to lower the price further. He's close to his target price, so it makes sense to continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his budget. He has 3 rounds left and can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He's also closer to his target price, so he may be able to push for a more favorable outcome in the next few rounds."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1180000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his target price and needs to find a balance between pushing for a lower price and closing the deal.  He's increasing his offer from the previous round, but still aiming to get the price lower than Alice's last offer.  This shows Alice he's serious about a deal, but isn't willing to go above his budget.  With only two rounds left, he's trying to make a final push to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  With only one round left, the chances of getting Alice to accept a lower offer are slim.  Bob has already been aggressively negotiating, and it's likely that Alice won't budge significantly in the final round. Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
