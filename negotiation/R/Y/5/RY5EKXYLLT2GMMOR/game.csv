"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as 85. How about we meet in the middle at 100? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $100 is still a little high for me.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as 90. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at 95? It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think it's worth it.",95.0,Alice,5,
