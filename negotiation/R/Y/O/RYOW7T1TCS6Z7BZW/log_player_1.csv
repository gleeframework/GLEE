"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking for $170 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and expressing my confidence in the product's appeal to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested but $170 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price, as it's significantly below my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $120 to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by coming down to $120, which is still above my minimum but might be more appealing to Bob.  I'm also reiterating that his offer is too low and expressing my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $120 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price. However, $95 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. This would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm sticking to my negotiation strategy of finding a middle ground. I'm offering $110, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's current offer ($95). I'm also trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness by highlighting that this price is a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to compromise.  I'm still not able to go higher than $100.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for $100. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John for $150, but I'm hoping to secure a slightly better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $100 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $105? It's a good compromise and I think it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm sticking with the strategy of meeting in the middle, offering $105 which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's current offer ($100). I'm highlighting the compromise and framing it as a fair price for both of us."
