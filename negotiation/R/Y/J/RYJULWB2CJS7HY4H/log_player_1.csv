Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,500."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's maximum gives him the feeling of getting a deal while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines."
