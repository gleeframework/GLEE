{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more. 
* **Is lower than your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $12,000, giving you room to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for counteroffers:** This leaves room for a back-and-forth negotiation with Bob. 

If Bob rejects, I can consider his counteroffer, keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum of $12,000. It's not worth selling the product for that price when I know I can get $12,000 from John. I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too rich for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is still significantly below my minimum of $12,000, and he's made it clear it's his final offer. While I'd like to get more, it's not worth risking a further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price.  It's better to sell to John for $12,000 and ensure I reach my minimum valuation."
