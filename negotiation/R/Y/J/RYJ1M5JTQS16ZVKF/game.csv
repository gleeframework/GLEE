"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum value. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too rich for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",9800.0,Bob,4,
