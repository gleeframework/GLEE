Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now quite close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away, and I'd lose out on a significant profit by selling to John. Accepting $1,600,000 is a strong outcome in this scenario."
