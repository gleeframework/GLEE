"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what Bob is willing to pay from John ($1,500,000).  It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a better price.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get closer to his $1,500,000 ceiling while still saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is very tempting, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This would leave some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I believe the product is worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll agree once you see the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is now higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice as any further counteroffers will likely be even higher. It's more cost-effective for Bob to simply buy the product from John at his fixed price."
