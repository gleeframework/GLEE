"I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value goes beyond its price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $10250. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also taking into account your budget limitations.",10250.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $10100.

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,10050.0
"I've made a significant concession already, and I'm not willing to go below $10050. I'm starting to think that we might be at an impasse. However, I'm still open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $10050, which would be $10025. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10025.0,Alice,7,,
