Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have room to start high.  A starting price of $2,250,000 is 150% of your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""valuable asset"" and ""true worth"" emphasizes the product's value and might encourage Bob to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, the language doesn't close the door to negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still likely reach a price higher than John's offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize your profit. However, setting the price too high could lead to Bob rejecting the offer outright.  It's a balance between ambition and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
