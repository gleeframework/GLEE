"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,500.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12500.0,Bob,4,
