"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is more than his maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, as he might be able to get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,500.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12500}
