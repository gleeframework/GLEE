"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's not even close to what the product is worth to me.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,300,000. This is still a significant profit for me and hopefully more enticing to Bob than his initial offer. I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, although it's getting closer.  I'm not going to accept it yet.  I'm hoping to get at least $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm dropping the price again to $1,200,000. This is a significant price reduction from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal. It's also a price that still provides me with a good profit margin. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm not sure if he's willing to go much higher. However, I'm still hopeful we can find a middle ground, and I'm not ready to settle for less than $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,150,000. This is a small concession, but I'm hoping it will convince Bob to close the deal.  I'm running out of rounds, and I need to consider the risk of losing this sale entirely.  This is my last attempt to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally getting closer to my bottom line.  We're only two rounds away from selling to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000, so I need to be realistic.  $1,100,000 is still a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  I'll accept his offer."
