"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It's more beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to attempt to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget, knowing that Alice values the product at $1,500,000. This is a significant discount, but I'm hoping to demonstrate my seriousness and start the negotiation. There's still a chance Alice might reject it, but it sets the stage for a more reasonable counteroffer from her in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget.  I'm still within the first half of the negotiation rounds, so it's worth continuing to try and get a better price.  I'll likely need to increase my counteroffer slightly in the next round, but I'm hopeful that we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below my maximum budget. I believe this is a fair compromise, as it's significantly lower than Alice's current offer but also demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. I believe I can still get a better price with a few more rounds of counteroffers. My goal is to secure the product within my budget, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that significantly exceeds it.  I'll increase my counteroffer slightly in the next round, but I'll also be ready to consider buying from John if the negotiation doesn't reach a favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This puts me at a halfway point between my last offer and Alice's current offer. With only 4 rounds left, I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to accept, or at least come closer to my desired price. I'm still wary of going too high, as I want to stay within my budget, but I'm confident that this offer shows good faith."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, though it's getting closer to my desired price. We only have 3 rounds left, and I'm still hopeful that we can find a middle ground. I'll continue to counteroffer, but I'm also getting closer to considering buying from John if the negotiation doesn't yield a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the final few rounds, and I'm getting closer to my limit. This offer is a small increase from my last one, demonstrating I'm still interested, but also shows I'm not willing to go much higher.  I'm hoping this will be a strong enough offer for Alice to accept, but I'm also preparing to consider John's offer if necessary."
