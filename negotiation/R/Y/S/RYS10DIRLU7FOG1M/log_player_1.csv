"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still potentially attractive to him.  It leaves room for negotiation and avoids immediately resorting to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $150.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than that. 
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is still a viable option, but I want to explore further negotiation with Bob first.** I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While I value this product at more than $130, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $135?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the effort. Considering my budget, could we possibly agree on $128 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $150.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than that. 
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option.
* **Selling to John is becoming increasingly attractive.**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be realistic about my chances of getting a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $135.  Let's meet in the middle at $131.  It's a small step closer to my desired price, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 131} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your proposal and I believe we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. Would $129 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $150.** I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **We're down to only 4 rounds left.**  The negotiation is getting very close to the point where it's not worth risking a deal with John. 
* **John's offer is a sure thing, and it meets my minimum requirements.**  The potential for getting a slightly better price from Bob is not worth the risk of ending up with nothing at all. 

Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids any further negotiation with Bob."
