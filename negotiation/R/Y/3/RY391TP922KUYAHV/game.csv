"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $600000 for it. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $800000? This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to come to a fair agreement.",800000.0,Alice,3,
