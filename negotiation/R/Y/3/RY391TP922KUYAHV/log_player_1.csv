Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $600000 for it. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than $600,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to find a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to come to a fair agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
