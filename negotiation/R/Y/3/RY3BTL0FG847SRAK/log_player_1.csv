Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Your Backup:** John will buy it for $1,000,000

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's value without going so high that he'll reject it.  There's a ""zone of possible agreement"" between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair.  This is a limited-time offer as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** We're keeping it polite and professional, highlighting the product's value.  Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your only other option) adds a bit of urgency.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still securing a significant portion of the potential profit. 

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting or moving on to John."
