Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us, which encourages Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Keeping John as an option:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  He's clearly interested in the product, and I have room to compromise.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John is always an option, but I prefer to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintaining profitability:** $1,350,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Urgency:** I emphasize closing the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $1,300,000 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price, it's still a good deal considering Bob's initial offer. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time, and I might not be able to get a better price from Bob.
* **Risk of losing John:** If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk losing John as a buyer, potentially leaving me with a much lower price.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a price that's still profitable and minimizes the risk of losing out on a better deal."
