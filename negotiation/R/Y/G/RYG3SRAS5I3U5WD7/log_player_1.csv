"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to get a good price, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $987,500. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, we are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more substantial movement from him to consider accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $987,500 is still a difficult pill to swallow. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  Would you consider $1,010,000? This is a significant concession on my end."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,010,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $998,750. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $998,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $998,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but at this rate, we're unlikely to reach a price that's acceptable to me within the remaining rounds. It's clear he's highly price-sensitive and unwilling to significantly increase his offer.  It's in my best interest to cut my losses and sell to John, guaranteeing the full $1,200,000 value."
