"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand that you're looking to get a good price, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $987,500. Can we make a deal at this price?",987500.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $987,500 is still a difficult pill to swallow. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  Would you consider $1,010,000? This is a significant concession on my end.",1010000.0,Alice,5,,
