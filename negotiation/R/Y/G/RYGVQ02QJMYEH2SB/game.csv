"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, I must stick to my budgetary limits. I am unable to meet the price of $1700000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1650000. I'm willing to meet you at $1675000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
