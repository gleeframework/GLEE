"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $13,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $13,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
