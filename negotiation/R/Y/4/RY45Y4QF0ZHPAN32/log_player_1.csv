Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer, as it is far below my minimum acceptable value. I will try to counter offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $8,250?"", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8250 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to save some money on this purchase. Can you consider $7750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'll try to counteroffer one more time to see if we can get closer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your need to save money, but $7750 is still significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm willing to compromise a little further, but I need to receive at least $8,000 for this product. Let's split the difference – how about $7,875?"", ""product_price"": 7875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7875 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'll try one last counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I've come down significantly from my initial price, and $7,500 is still below my minimum value. I'm willing to make one final compromise –  how about $7,625? If you're not willing to go that high, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 7625}

This is getting frustrating. Bob is clearly not willing to budge much, and I've already made significant concessions. I'm running out of time, and I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's a better deal than Bob's offer, and I'm confident that I'll get a good price."
