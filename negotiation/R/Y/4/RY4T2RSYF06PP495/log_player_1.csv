"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its worth to both of us and the opportunity it presents.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
