"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its worth to both of us and the opportunity it presents.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
