Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a small profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $97.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow you to make a small profit. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

The current offer from Bob ($97.5) is below your minimum price of $120.  While there are still a few rounds left,  it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly enough to make it worthwhile to continue negotiating.  Therefore, selling to John for $120 is the best option at this point."
