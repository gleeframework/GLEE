"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $130. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $130 is more than Alice values the product for, it's still less than your maximum price of $150 and cheaper than buying from John."
