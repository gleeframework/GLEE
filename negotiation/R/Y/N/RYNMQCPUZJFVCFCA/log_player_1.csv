"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $120 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $80.  While it's better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105? This would still give you a good deal, and it would be closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for countering, Alice. I understand it's worth a lot to you, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to sell for that price. I believe I can get a better offer from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $95. This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $90 is really the most I can do.  If you're not able to do $90, I understand, but I might have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum, but I've already rejected his offer twice, and it doesn't seem like he's willing to budge. With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep negotiating.  I'm going to sell to John for $100 to avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
