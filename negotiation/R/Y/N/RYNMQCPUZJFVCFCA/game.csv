"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105? This would still give you a good deal, and it would be closer to my minimum.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I understand it's worth a lot to you, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $95. This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $90 is really the most I can do.  If you're not able to do $90, I understand, but I might have to look at other options.",90.0,Bob,6,
