"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit tight for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $160. Can you meet me in the middle?,160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $170. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to compromise on.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $165. Can we meet at that price?",165.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $175. It's a good price, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sacrifice.",175.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $170. I'm starting to think I might have to look elsewhere if we can't meet at this price, though.",170.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting a bit frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $180. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, though. I'll include a free accessory that's worth $20. So, the total price would be $180 for the product and the accessory. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",180.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of the free accessory, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable paying $180. I'm willing to pay $165, and that's my final offer. If I don't get it, I'll have to look elsewhere.",165.0,Bob,10,
