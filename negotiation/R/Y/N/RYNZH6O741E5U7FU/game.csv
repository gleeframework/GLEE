,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $140? I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $160? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $160 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $155.  That's the absolute most I can do.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to give you a bit more. How about $157? It's a compromise that still benefits me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",157.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $157 is still a little more than I'm aiming for. Let's try $152.  If we can meet in the middle there, I think we can make this work.",152.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $155? It's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",155.0,Alice,7,
