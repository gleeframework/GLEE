,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
