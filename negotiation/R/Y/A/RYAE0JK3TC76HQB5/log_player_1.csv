{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, aiming to get a higher price than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm also confident that the product's worth justifies this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a strict budget in mind. I can do $9,000.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is within my acceptable range, especially considering the possibility of further negotiation. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of a prolonged negotiation and secures a sale that's close to my minimum acceptable price."
