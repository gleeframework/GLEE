"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000.  This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering Bob my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize this and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to receive.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. There's still time to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000, showing some flexibility. I'm still above my minimum and hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will continue to negotiate with him.  While I'm losing time, I'm still confident I can get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to try a compromise by offering $10,500. This is a small step down from my last offer but still above Bob's last offer. It shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, hoping he'll see the value in the product and come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached round 8, and Bob is still unwilling to move much from his offer of $10,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement with Bob. Time is running out, and we're at a point where we need to make a decision. Given that we're in our 8th round, the likelihood of Bob increasing his offer significantly is low. Therefore, it's prudent to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risking getting nothing or a lower price from Bob."
