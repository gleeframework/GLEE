"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $100? I'm really interested in this product but need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $160 is still a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
