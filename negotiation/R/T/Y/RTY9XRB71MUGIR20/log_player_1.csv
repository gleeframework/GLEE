{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your floor price of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer isn't too aggressive, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not happy with the price.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can always consider lowering the price slightly, but remember to keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as your fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly below the price you initially offered. It's worthwhile to attempt to negotiate a higher price before accepting. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can send a counteroffer to see if you can secure a better deal. Remember, you still have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to secure a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're not rigidly sticking to your initial price, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Offers a compromise:** The proposed price is the midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it a reasonable compromise.
* **Maintains a profitable margin:**  This price is still above your minimum requirement and allows you to earn a decent profit.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can re-evaluate your options based on his potential counteroffer and whether you're comfortable accepting a lower price or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've reviewed your latest offer of $1,350,000. While I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my initial offer. Would it be possible for us to discuss a price of $1,325,000? I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's latest offer is close enough to your desired price point, and it's definitely a better deal than selling to John. By accepting this offer, you secure a sale at a price that's still significantly above your minimum requirement.  It's a good compromise that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."
