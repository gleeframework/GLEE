"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to secure a fair price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've reviewed your latest offer of $1,350,000. While I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my initial offer. Would it be possible for us to discuss a price of $1,325,000? I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
