"I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $6,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,250?  Let me know what you think!",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $7,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $6,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $6,800 is still too low for me. How about we compromise at $7,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",7000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $6,900, which is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",6900.0,Bob,6,
