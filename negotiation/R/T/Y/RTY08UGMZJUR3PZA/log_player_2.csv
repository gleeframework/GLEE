# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, so I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's a bit lower than what I could get from someone else. How about $90? Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
