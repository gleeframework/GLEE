"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm personally very attached to, but I'm ready to let it go for the right price.  I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. It's a fair price that leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with buying from John for $1,200,000. While buying from John is slightly over your ideal budget, it's better than paying Alice's overpriced offer."
