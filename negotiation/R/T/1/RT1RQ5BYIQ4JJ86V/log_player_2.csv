"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way above his budget of $8,000, and he can get the product from John for a much lower price.  It's better to counter-offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to give you a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than the initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the product from John for $8,000, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still out of my range.  I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us. Would you consider $9,500?  It's a fair compromise that's closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While Alice is getting closer, $10,500 is still above his budget. Since he can buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $9,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really committed to making this deal happen. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. It's a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice is offering $10,000, which is still above Bob's budget. While he's willing to pay up to $8,000, John is selling the product for exactly that amount. It's more efficient and financially beneficial for Bob to buy from John."
