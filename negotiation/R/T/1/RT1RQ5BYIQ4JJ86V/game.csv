"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to give you a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still out of my range.  I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us. Would you consider $9,500?  It's a fair compromise that's closer to my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $9,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really committed to making this deal happen. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. It's a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
