"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $7,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $6,800? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $6,800. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, which is a bit closer to my original offer. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this works for you.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we make this the final offer: $7,000?  If that doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately have to go with a different option.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not getting the value I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $7,400, which is a small increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this works for you.",7400.0,Alice,7,
