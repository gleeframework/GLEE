Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $800,000 (what I'd get from John)
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $1,200,000
* **My strategy:** I'm offering a price that is in the middle, hoping to secure a higher price than my minimum while still being attractive to Bob. 

This strategy allows for some negotiation room if Bob is willing to pay more."
