"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's still a significant discount from its true worth. I'm open to further discussion and willing to meet you in the middle if necessary.",700000.0,Bob,2,
