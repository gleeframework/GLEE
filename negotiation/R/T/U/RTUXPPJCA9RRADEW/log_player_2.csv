{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  $15,000 is way over your budget. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$12,000 is still a bit high, but Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  It's worth continuing to try and get the price down further."

This offer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows you're willing to meet halfway but still maintain your budget."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still too high, but she's getting closer to your price.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more, but the option to buy from John is starting to look very tempting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This is a final push to get Alice closer to your ideal price. It's a significant increase from your last offer, indicating a willingness to compromise but also highlighting the risk of losing the deal if she rejects. It's a gamble, but it could pay off if Alice is truly motivated to close the deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice has shown some flexibility, but she's still significantly above your desired price.  At this point, it's better to secure the product at John's price, even though it's not your absolute ideal.  You've already invested several rounds in negotiating with Alice and there's no guarantee she'll budge further, and it's getting late in the game."
