"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $850000. I understand it's a significant investment, but I believe it's a value you'll appreciate. This product is worth $800000 to you, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay the full value, so this is a limited-time offer. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

**Explanation:**

Alice is asking for $850,000, which is above your maximum budget of $800,000. You can get the same product from John for $800,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
