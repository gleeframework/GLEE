Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is more than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to further incentivize a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  
* **John is a Safe Option:**  While I'd prefer to get the best price, selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed win and ensures I don't lose out on a significant amount of money.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, aiming to find a compromise. 
* If Bob continues to reject offers that are too low, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $8,000. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to make Bob feel like I'm working towards a mutually agreeable solution.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!  I've achieved a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll have to weigh my options:
    * **Counter Again:**  If I believe there's still room for a reasonable agreement, I'll counter again, possibly lowering the price slightly.
    * **Sell to John:** If Bob seems unwilling to budge, I'll finalize the sale with John for $15,000."
