"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring other options before committing to the full price.  Since you have no idea what Alice's true value is, there's a chance you can get the product for less.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting at half the original price is a strong opening move. It signals you're serious about buying but are willing to negotiate. This allows Alice to either accept a good deal for her, or reject and come down from her original price in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, it's still a significant price. There's room for more negotiation. Alice has shown a willingness to move, and rejecting again signals that you're determined to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're moving closer to Alice's offer. A counteroffer of $700,000 is a good middle ground. It shows that you're serious about buying while still leaving room for compromise. This gives Alice the opportunity to either accept and get a good deal, or reject and potentially move closer to your price in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is tempting, we're still only halfway through our negotiation rounds. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower. Rejecting again shows your determination to get a better deal and signals that you're willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a deal.  Alice has come down to $850,000, showing flexibility.  Offering $750,000 shows we're serious about buying while still pushing for a good price. It also gives Alice the chance to accept a decent offer or reject and potentially meet us in the middle.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving and increases our chances of getting a good deal."
