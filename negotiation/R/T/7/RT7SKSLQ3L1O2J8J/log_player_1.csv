"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a high offer, but not too high to risk Bob immediately rejecting.
* I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the value he sees in the product.
* This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $8,000.
* Although I'm closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet.
* I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 
* I'm also not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hopeful of securing a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm reducing my price slightly from the previous offer, showing flexibility.
*  $9,000 is still above my minimum value and allows for potential compromise. 
* This counteroffer aims to meet Bob halfway while still allowing me to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is now above my minimum value of $8,000.
* It's getting closer to my desired price, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer.
*  There are only 6 rounds remaining, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether.
* Accepting this offer ensures a profit and minimizes the risk of losing out on a better price later."
