# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm going to counter with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product's value justifies it."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm going to counter with a price of $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet in the middle now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is firming her position and unlikely to go much lower.  While closer to your goal, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed option at $800,000 with John."
