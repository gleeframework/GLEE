Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product's value justifies it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm going to counter with a price of $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet in the middle now."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
