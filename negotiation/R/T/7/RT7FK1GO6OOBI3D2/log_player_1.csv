Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but lower than our minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob values other factors (like convenience). 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason like ""special price"" or highlighting the ""value"" aims to make the offer more appealing.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We know we have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below our minimum."
