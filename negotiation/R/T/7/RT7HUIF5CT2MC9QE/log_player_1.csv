Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($150). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $150, so if Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum value ($150) and Bob's offer ($140). This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $145 is still below my minimum value of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum. Since John is willing to pay my minimum value, it's in my best interest to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
