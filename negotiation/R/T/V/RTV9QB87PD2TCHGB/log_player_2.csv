"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save money, and John is willing to sell for your maximum price of $120, there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount of $20 is a good first move. It shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and allows room for compromise. It's also a reasonable starting point, given your maximum budget is $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your ideal price point. Rejecting allows you to continue pushing for a lower price. There's still room to negotiate, and you have several rounds left to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice has already shown some flexibility by coming down from $120 to $110, this counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a price that is more advantageous to you. It's a reasonable increment that keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is within your budget and a good compromise. Continuing to negotiate might get you a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice might walk away or that you might run out of rounds before reaching an agreement. Accepting the offer secures the product within your budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
