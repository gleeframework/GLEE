{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts by acknowledging Bob's potential value for the product while still aiming for a price closer to your desired target. It also provides a friendly opening to encourage a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum value of $120 and is a good compromise. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
