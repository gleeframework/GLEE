"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially offering it for $1,800,000. This takes into account its unique qualities and potential for a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I see the value in the product but not at that price.  I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation. This tactic might encourage her to move down from her initial high number.
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to maximize savings. Even if this offer is rejected, it sets a marker for future rounds.
* **John as Backup:** I always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to accept a bad deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and so am I.  $1,400,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice came down by $400,000, so I'm reciprocating with a significant jump of $300,000 towards her last offer. This shows willingness to compromise. 
* **Above John's Price:**  Offering $1,100,000 signals I'm serious, as it's more than I'd pay John.
* **Room to Negotiate:** While closer to my limit, there's still room for negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
