"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,3,
