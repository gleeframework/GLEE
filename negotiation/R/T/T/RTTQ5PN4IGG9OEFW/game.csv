"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind. How about we bring the price down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $900,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm serious about acquiring this product, but it needs to make financial sense for me.  Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant investment on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a significant investment for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a compromise. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down further, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $850,000? I think that's a fair price, considering the value this product will bring to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
