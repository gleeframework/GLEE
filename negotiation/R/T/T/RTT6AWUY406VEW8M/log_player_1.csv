Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept right away. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum value. I'm also setting the stage for a potential counter-offer from Bob, which will give me more information about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. By rejecting his offer, I can send a counter-offer that hopefully gets us closer to my desired price without losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation. My goal is to find a compromise that allows both of us to be satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, and while I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll budge.  At this point, selling to John for my minimum price ensures I get a guaranteed profit, eliminating any risk of a further decrease in price or a complete deal breakdown."
