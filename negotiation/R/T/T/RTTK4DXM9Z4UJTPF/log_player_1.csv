"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for compromise.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is friendly and to the point, making it easy for Bob to understand the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I am willing to pay $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is at your minimum acceptable price, but you can potentially get more. It's worth trying to negotiate further. Even if Bob doesn't budge, you can always sell to John for the same amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more for the product.  How about $13,500? This is still a great deal for you, as you value it at $15,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** By offering $13,500, I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. This might encourage him to come up slightly.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, making the counteroffer seem reasonable.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $13,500 is still higher than my minimum, so I'm not sacrificing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am still interested in purchasing the product. I would like to propose a price of $12,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 less than what John is offering.  While it's tempting to try and push for more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away and I'll be left with John's offer.  It's better to secure the deal and get the extra $500 than to risk losing the sale completely."
