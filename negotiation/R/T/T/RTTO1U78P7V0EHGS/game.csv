"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product, but $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant gap from my valuation. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I can afford, it's still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for me, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value our conversation and would like to close this deal. My final offer is $980,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's more than fair.",980000.0,Alice,5,
