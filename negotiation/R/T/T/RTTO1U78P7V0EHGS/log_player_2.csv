"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth more to Alice than to Bob, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product, but $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant gap from my valuation. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $1,025,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value our conversation and would like to close this deal. My final offer is $980,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's more than fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has made a significant concession, bringing the price down to $980,000. This is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his budget and a better deal than buying from John for $800,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a reasonable price."
