Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John provides leverage.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting high ($119) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also creates a sense of urgency (""limited time""). 
* **Avoid appearing desperate:** Offering it for $120 immediately might make Bob think you're desperate and unwilling to negotiate.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
