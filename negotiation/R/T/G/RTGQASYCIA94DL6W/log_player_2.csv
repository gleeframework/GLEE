Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too far from what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,375,000. I believe this price represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To be frank, $1,300,000 is cutting it very close, and I have to consider other options if we can't bridge this gap. I'm willing to accept $1,350,000 - that's my final offer. I believe this is more than fair and allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.
