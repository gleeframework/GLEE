"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** You can buy the product for $1,400,000 from Alice, which is cheaper than the $1,500,000 John is asking. 
* **You're still saving money:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and you're getting it for less, meaning you're getting a good deal."
