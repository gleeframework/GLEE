"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be open to $155? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $165. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for $165, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference at $160? It's closer to my budget and still a good deal for you.",160.0,Bob,4,

"I like your thinking, Bob! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I was thinking I could do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $162? It's a small step up from $160, but I think it's worth it for the value this product brings. What do you think?",162.0,Alice,5,
