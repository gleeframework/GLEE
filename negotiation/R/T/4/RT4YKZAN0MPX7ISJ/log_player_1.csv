"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it immediately. I'd like to see if I can get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise a bit but am not desperate to sell at his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is offering $160, which is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum and I'm getting closer to my desired price.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price or having to sell to John."
