"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $900,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's $1,000,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $800,000. Bob's offer of $850,000 is a reasonable starting point.  It gives Alice some room to negotiate while still offering Bob a significant discount from John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is higher than Bob's initial offer of $850,000. It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price, as Bob has room to go lower than John's $1,000,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's previous counteroffer of $850,000 was rejected. Alice's offer of $920,000 is too high. Bob is aiming for a middle ground.  $875,000 is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, showing willingness to compromise but still staying below Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to John's price of $1,000,000. While tempting, Bob still has room to negotiate and can try to get a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is getting close to John's price, but Bob still has room to negotiate. This counteroffer of $890,000 shows Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway, increasing his previous offer but staying below Alice's. This could be a good compromise point for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $960,000 is very close to John's price of $1,000,000.  There are only 3 rounds left.  There's not enough time to negotiate a significantly better deal with Alice. It's more efficient to buy from John and avoid the risk of not being able to reach an agreement with Alice."
