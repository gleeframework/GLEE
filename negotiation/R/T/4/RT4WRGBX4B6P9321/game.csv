"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the value you place on the product at $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing further and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering your value of $800,000, and it allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this counteroffer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
