Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering your value of $800,000, and it allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
