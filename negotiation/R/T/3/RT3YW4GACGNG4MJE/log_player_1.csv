This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  It also signals that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $112.50 is above my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal."
