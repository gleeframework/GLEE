,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay full price. Can you meet me in the middle?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $85? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider it?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to be fair here, but $85 is still too low for me. I understand you have your budget, but I'm not comfortable going that low. How about we meet in the middle again at $95? This is a great product, and I think you'll be happy with it at this price. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,5,
