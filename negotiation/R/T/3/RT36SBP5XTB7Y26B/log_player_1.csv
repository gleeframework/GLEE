{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it also gives you some room to negotiate if needed.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and try to maximize my profit while still maintaining a good relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay full price. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price. I can still make a counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $120 if I can't reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $85? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob has increased his offer to $85, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than that. I will reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round. If not, I will sell the product to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to be fair here, but $85 is still too low for me. I understand you have your budget, but I'm not comfortable going that low. How about we meet in the middle again at $95? This is a great product, and I think you'll be happy with it at this price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
