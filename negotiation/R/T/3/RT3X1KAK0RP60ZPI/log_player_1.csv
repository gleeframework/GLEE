Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I would like to earn more, Bob's offer is the maximum value he's willing to pay.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids any risk of further negotiation.  It's also the same price I can get from John, so there's no benefit in continuing."
