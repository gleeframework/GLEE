"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($800,000). Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Offering $900,000 is a significant discount from Alice's original offer, but still above her value of $800,000. This shows Bob is serious about buying but is willing to negotiate. 
* **Message:** Bob's message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating his counteroffer. 
* **Rounds:** With 9 rounds remaining, Bob has time to explore other options if this offer is rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This gives us both a great deal and allows us to move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above the product's worth to her, but it's getting closer to Bob's target price.
* **Rounds:**  With 7 rounds left, Bob has some time to explore other options if he rejects this offer. However, accepting now saves him $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even though Bob could potentially negotiate a lower price, the risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing. 

It's a good compromise, and  Bob gets a decent deal while securing the product."
