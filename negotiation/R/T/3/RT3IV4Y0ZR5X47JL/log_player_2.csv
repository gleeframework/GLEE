"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm starting with a price of $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $950,000 is close to your maximum budget, and you want to save as much money as possible. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** You have 10 rounds, which gives you ample opportunity to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** While John's offer is higher, it's a safety net if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of this product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $900,000 is still closer to her value of the product than yours. 
* **Further negotiation is necessary:** You have several rounds left, and you can likely get a better price.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** You can always purchase from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $875,000? This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still being within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll see it as a sign of my desire to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal and get you the product you need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high:** While $890,000 is closer to your ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.
* **More rounds remain:** You have 5 rounds left, and there's a good chance you can push Alice further down.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** You can always buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
