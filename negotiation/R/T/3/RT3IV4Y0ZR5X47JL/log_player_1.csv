Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $890,000.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $900,000, we're down to 4 rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal.  $880,000 is still a good profit for me, and I don't want to push my luck further."
