"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value may be different for you. To start, I'm offering it to you for $120. This price takes into account both the value of the product and the opportunity to close the deal within our 10-round negotiation period.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. Considering the value of the product and the time we have left, I would like to propose an adjusted price of $110. This offers a slight compromise while still allowing us to reach an agreement within our negotiation period.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $110 is still above my budget.  I'm confident I can get a better deal elsewhere, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105.  Let's try to close this deal and make it worth both our time.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our negotiation history, I believe we can come to an agreement. I am willing to offer the product to you for $107.50. This price reflects a reasonable compromise and allows us to conclude the negotiation within our 10-round limit.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $102.50, which is my absolute maximum.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before time runs out.",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued patience and understanding, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer the product to you for $105. This price reflects a fair compromise between our respective positions and should allow us to conclude the negotiation within our 10-round limit.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $101, which is my absolute final offer. We're both close to a deal, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and make it a win-win.",101.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your final offer. After evaluating the situation, I am willing to accept $101 for the product. This allows us to reach an agreement within our 10-round negotiation period and ensures a fair transaction for both parties.",101.0,Alice,9,
