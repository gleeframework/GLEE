"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth at least $1 million to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's incredibly fair for both of us. I'm offering it to you for $900,000.  Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $900,000, while John is selling for $1,000,000. This means accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000.
* **The product is worth more to you:**  You value the product at $1,000,000, so paying $900,000 still leaves you with a profit if you resell it.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best financial decision."
