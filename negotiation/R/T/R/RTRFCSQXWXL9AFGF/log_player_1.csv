Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but significantly lower than my minimum value ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately lose the deal.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is upbeat and focuses on the benefits of the deal for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard line, inviting Bob to counteroffer. This allows for a more dynamic negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation.
* If the negotiation drags on or I feel like I'm not getting close to my desired price, I'll move to John, who is willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below his own perceived value of $8,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 

It's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price.  There's still a gap between our desired prices, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to stay within my desired range.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him that $9,000 is still a good deal.
* **Collaborative Approach:** I'm using language like ""meet in the middle"" and ""find a solution"" to foster a sense of cooperation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll reassess his counteroffer and determine whether to continue negotiating or move on to John.  
* If his counteroffer is still significantly below my minimum, I'll likely move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price range.  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss, especially considering that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my full value.

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I will be more cautious.  I will likely make a counteroffer closer to my previous offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a reasonable agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Finality Implied:** I'm using language like ""split the difference"" and ""reach a reasonable agreement"" to suggest that this is my final offer.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the fairness of my offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer.  
* If his counteroffer remains significantly below my minimum or if I feel like we're getting nowhere, I will move on to John to secure the guaranteed sale."
