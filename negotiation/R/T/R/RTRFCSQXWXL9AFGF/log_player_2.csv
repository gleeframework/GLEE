"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"",

}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. By starting low, Bob signals that he's looking for a good deal while also allowing room to increase his offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to stay within my desired range.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now closer to your acceptable price range, but there's still room for negotiation. You're only $1,000 away from John's price, so it makes sense to see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Strategic Positioning:**  By countering with $7,000, Bob demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still leaving himself room to go up slightly if needed.
* **John's Price in Mind:** Bob is keeping John's $8,000 offer in his back pocket. He has some leverage knowing he has an alternative if the negotiation with Alice doesn't yield a satisfactory price.
* **Respectful Communication:**  The message maintains a polite and positive tone, which is important for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a reasonable agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

Alice has met your bottom line! There's no need to negotiate further, as you can buy from John at the same price. Accepting this offer secures the product at your target price."
