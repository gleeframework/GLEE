Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product for $1,190,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident this offer reflects its worth.  Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price ($1,190,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" you subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he hesitates.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
