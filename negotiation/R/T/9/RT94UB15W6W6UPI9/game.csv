"Alice, your offer is a bit above what I'm able to spend. I'd be interested in purchasing if we can get closer to $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
