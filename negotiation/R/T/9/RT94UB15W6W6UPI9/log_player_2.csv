"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit above what I'm able to spend. I'd be interested in purchasing if we can get closer to $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000. There's room for further negotiation, and it's better for Bob to continue trying to get a lower price rather than accepting an offer that's still too high."

I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}
