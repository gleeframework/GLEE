"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to start with an offer significantly lower than my actual maximum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Alice the impression I might be unwilling to go much higher.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm attempting to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. This can influence Alice's counteroffers. 
* **Leaving John as a Backup:** I haven't revealed my absolute maximum price, keeping the option of buying from John open if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down, but still way above my target price. I need to show her I'm serious about a much lower price point while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'll aim closer to the middle ground this time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,000,000 is still quite a leap from what I had in mind.  To be frank, I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. Would you consider $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Budget:** I've now given Alice a clearer picture of my budget, but without revealing my absolute maximum. This adds a sense of urgency and might encourage her to make a more significant concession.
* **Gradual Increase:** My offer is still a significant jump from the previous one, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate but am serious about the lower price range.
* **Pressure Tactic:**  Mentioning my target price of $800,000 applies subtle pressure. Alice knows if she doesn't move closer to that range, she risks losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $925,000? This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice is definitely coming closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above my maximum. 
* **Final Push:** I'll make one final offer very close to my limit. This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to make a deal or risk me walking away. 
* **John Option Still Valid:** I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't meet me close to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm ready to close this deal, but I need you to meet me a bit closer to make it work. My final offer is $790,000. If you accept, we have a deal!"", ""product_price"": 790000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I've made it clear this is my best price.  
* **Compromise:** The offer is slightly below my absolute maximum, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.
* **Time Pressure:** By presenting this as a final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency. Alice knows this is her last chance to make the sale at a price above my backup option."
