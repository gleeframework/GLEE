{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,250,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant profit for you:**  You're aiming for a good profit margin, but not being greedy. 
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  He's getting a good deal and has room to negotiate if he feels it's too high.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You're open to negotiation without giving away the whole profit margin.

Remember, if Bob rejects, you have the option to counter or walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000. The key is to strike a balance between getting the best possible price and not losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1250000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is still a significant profit, there's room for a better deal. Bob is clearly interested, and I can likely get a higher price by countering.  I'll use this opportunity to push for a price closer to my initial offer."

How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This offer is still very good for you, considering the value you place on this product."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to John's offer, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer, hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price.  If he doesn't budge, then I'll sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible deal, and I respect that. However, $1,075,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $1,125,000 to make this work.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
