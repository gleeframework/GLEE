"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit below what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate, and also shows that I'm open to finding a fair price. I'm also trying to build a positive relationship by being friendly and engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a nice product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is above my minimum, I'm not comfortable accepting that low of a price just yet. I'm going to counteroffer to try to find a middle ground.  I think I can get a better price than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  It seems like we both value the product, but maybe there's some middle ground. How about $118? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $118 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'm going to counteroffer to try and get a little closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I think we're getting close!  How about $122? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 122}
