"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you have John as a fallback option at $10,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
