``` 

This offer represents a compromise - it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me, but still leaves me with a profit margin. This gives Bob a chance to accept a deal that's beneficial to him while still allowing me to secure a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a decent sum, it's far below the product's worth to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price.  A counteroffer will give me a chance to see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This still gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can agree on a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my initial counteroffer, it's still too far below the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's worth.  I will make a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
