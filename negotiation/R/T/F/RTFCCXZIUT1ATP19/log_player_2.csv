# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm suggesting a price of $100 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the unique benefits and features it offers. I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
