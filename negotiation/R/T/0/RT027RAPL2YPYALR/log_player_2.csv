"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but you can potentially get a better deal.**  You want to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counteroffer process.** This gives you the chance to explore if Alice is willing to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget and represents a good savings.**  You're looking to spend no more than $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is significantly lower than that.
* **Further negotiation may not be worth the effort.** While you could potentially get a slightly lower price, the difference between $1,075,000 and your initial counteroffer of $1,050,000 is relatively small.  It's likely that Alice won't budge much further.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most practical choice, allowing you to secure the product while saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
