"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $180. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $180 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $100 limit and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the lowest I can go is $150.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice came down a bit, but $150 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could you meet me halfway at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've increased my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly lower than her offer. By suggesting ""halfway,"" I'm aiming for a price closer to my target while acknowledging her need to sell at a reasonable price."
