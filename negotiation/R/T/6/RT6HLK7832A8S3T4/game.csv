"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, my original price was rooted in a deep understanding of the product's potential.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part, while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your new price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
