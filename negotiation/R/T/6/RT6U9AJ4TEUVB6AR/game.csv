"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a concession, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant concession. I think this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'll meet you at $820,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
