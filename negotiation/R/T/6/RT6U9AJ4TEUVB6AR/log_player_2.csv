"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a concession, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'll meet you at $820,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?
