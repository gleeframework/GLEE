Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for a higher amount and have a few more rounds to try and get it."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your need to save money, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is sticking to his price, but I'm still not ready to settle. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him closer to my desired price.  If that doesn't work, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,065,000. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1065000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,065,000 is still not acceptable to me. I'm willing to pay $1,030,000 for the product. This is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

This negotiation has gone on long enough.  I'm not confident I can get Bob to meet my desired price, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
