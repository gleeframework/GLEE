"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the interest in selling me the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to agree to $12000. I would like to propose $9500 as my final offer. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer it to you for $11000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to consider $10500 as my final offer. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer it to you for $10750. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can seal the deal.",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose $10250 as my final offer. I hope this is within your consideration.",10250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'll make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $10750 is too low, so I'll offer it to you for $11000, but I'll throw in a small concession - I'll give you a 1% discount, so the final price would be $10900. This is my absolute final offer.",10900.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate the additional concession. However, I am still unable to agree to $10900. My final offer remains at $10250. I hope this allows us to reach an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,10,
