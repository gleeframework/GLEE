"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's becoming clear that negotiating with Alice will be difficult, and Bob doesn't want to risk getting stuck paying a higher price.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the most financially advantageous option at this point."
