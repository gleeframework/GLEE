"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
