"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if that works for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
