"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18,000 is way out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower than this.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll pay you $12,000? I'm really serious about buying this product, but that's the most I can afford right now.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really serious about buying this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower than this.",13500.0,Alice,5,
