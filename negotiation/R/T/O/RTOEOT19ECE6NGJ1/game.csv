"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling point. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is simply too low.  This product offers substantial value to you, and I'm confident it's worth more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
