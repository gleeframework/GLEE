"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is more than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. Bob's offer is a sign he's interested, so I'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to show flexibility, but still holding out for a price closer to my target. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, while also demonstrating the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still less than my initial goal, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $8,750 is a decent profit, and it's likely Bob won't budge much further."
