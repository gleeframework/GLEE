"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit.  I'm aware it's likely Bob will reject this, but it sets the stage for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I believe it's a reasonable price point that might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm still within the early stages of negotiations, and I'm not ready to give up on the possibility of getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,300,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still confident that this price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize this and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my target price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can bridge the gap. It's worth noting that I'm halfway through the negotiations and haven't gotten closer to my target price. I'm not sure how many more rounds I'm willing to spend on this negotiation, but I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,275,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price point that reflects the value of the product. This is a more significant move towards Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to meet halfway.  We're getting closer to an agreement, and I'm hoping this will be the offer that Bob accepts."
