"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  It offers significant value, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential value, I'm not ready to commit to $950,000 at this point. To make this deal work for me, I'd need to bring the price down to $850,000.  This would be a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while allowing for a comfortable profit margin for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. While $850,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while still allowing you a substantial profit margin.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $900,000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still giving me a reasonable return on my investment. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to find a middle ground here, but I'm afraid $875,000 is still below what I consider acceptable for this product. I'm willing to make one final concession at $887,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price for the value you'll be receiving.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $887,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $870,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away satisfied. ",870000.0,Bob,6,
