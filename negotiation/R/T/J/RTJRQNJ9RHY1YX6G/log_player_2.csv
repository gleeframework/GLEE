The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer is still too high, and with only a few rounds left, I'm not confident I can get her down to my desired price. I'm better off buying from John for $100 and avoiding further negotiation."
