Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made.

**The Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're not starting at your minimum, showing you value the product.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the price.
* **Urgency:** The ""time-sensitive"" aspect encourages Bob to act quickly without being overly aggressive. 
* **Profit Margin:** You secure a $150,000 profit, significantly more than John's offer.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still making a substantial profit.
* **Relationship:**  While maximizing profit is important, consider if a long-term business relationship with Bob is valuable. Sometimes, a slightly smaller profit upfront can lead to bigger gains in the future."
