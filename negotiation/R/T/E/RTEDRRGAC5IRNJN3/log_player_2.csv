"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $130 is above his maximum price, so he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $115 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  Bob wants to start his counteroffer lower than his maximum price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Being reasonable:** While $115 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's not too far off, making the counteroffer seem realistic. 
* **Expressing interest:**  Bob emphasizes his interest in the product to keep the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $125?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** Alice's new offer of $125 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $120. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate. 
* **John as a fallback:** Bob has John as an alternative, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a price above his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $120.  It's my final offer, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  Bob is making it clear that $120 is his absolute limit, adding pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Immediate purchase:**  The ""ready to buy right now"" statement adds urgency and potential pressure.
* **Fair compromise:**  While $120 is Alice's minimum, it's also Bob's maximum, making it a possible compromise point."
