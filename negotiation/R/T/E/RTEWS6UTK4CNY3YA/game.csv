"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to do $9,500?  I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay $10,500. If you're serious about selling it, I think this is a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,
