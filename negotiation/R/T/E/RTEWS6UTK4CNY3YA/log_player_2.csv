**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to do $9,500?  I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a price you're comfortable with."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay $10,500. If you're serious about selling it, I think this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. Even though it's a small difference, it's not worth risking further negotiation, as there's a chance Alice might refuse another counteroffer. You can get the product for a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so that's the best option in this situation."
