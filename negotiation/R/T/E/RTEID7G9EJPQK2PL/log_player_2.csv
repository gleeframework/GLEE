"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget of $800,000. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a better price. There's no reason to buy from John yet, as you haven't explored Alice's willingness to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is $200,000 lower than Alice's initial price. This is a significant reduction but still leaves some room for negotiation. The goal is to see if Alice is willing to budge on her price and start the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still above my budget. I'll continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. There's still time to reach a deal within my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay my maximum budget for the product.  I'm hoping Alice will recognize that this is a fair price for both of us, given her valuation.  If she rejects this offer, I will buy from John."
