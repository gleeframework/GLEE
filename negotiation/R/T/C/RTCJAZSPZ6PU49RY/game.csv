"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know this is worth at least $1,500,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement!",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to the true value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $1,520,000. I think this is a more reasonable price, considering the value of the product.",1520000.0,Bob,4,
