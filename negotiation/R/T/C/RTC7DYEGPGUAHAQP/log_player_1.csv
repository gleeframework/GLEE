Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to try and push for a better price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $950,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still a significant loss. I'm going to try to squeeze out a little more in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, we're still only at $960,000. I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my goal of $1,000,000. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and while we're getting closer, we haven't reached a price I'm truly comfortable with. I'm still losing a substantial amount of money, but selling to John will at least ensure I meet my minimum goal."
