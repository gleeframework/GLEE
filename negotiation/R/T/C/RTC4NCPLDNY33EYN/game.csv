"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I acknowledge the product's potential, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, a price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
