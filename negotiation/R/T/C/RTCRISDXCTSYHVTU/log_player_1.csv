Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than what the product is worth to Bob, but not so high that he's immediately going to reject it. I want to see if I can get him to come up a bit. If he rejects this offer, I'm ready to counter, but also ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation gets too frustrating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd be happy to take $1,000,000 from John, I'm still hoping to get a bit more from Bob. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly from my initial offer, but still try to stay above the $1,000,000 value to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get more from Bob, we've gone through a few rounds and he's not budging much. I don't want to risk another counteroffer and potentially end up with a lower price.  John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a solid deal for me."
