"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $9,500 for the product. This leaves both of us with a good margin and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. Would you be willing to accept $9,250 for the product?",9250.0,Bob,4,
