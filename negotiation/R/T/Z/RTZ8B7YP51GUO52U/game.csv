"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that has the potential to be extremely valuable. I'm confident it would be worth at least $1200000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for a price significantly lower than that, to ensure a win-win situation.  I'm open to discussing the price further, but I'm confident it's an offer you won't want to miss.  Let me know if you're interested in learning more.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
