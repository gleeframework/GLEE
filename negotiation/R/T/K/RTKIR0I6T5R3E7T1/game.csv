"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for a price significantly lower than its worth to you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which would be $925,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",925000.0,Bob,4,
