"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close as possible to Alice's value of $10,000.  Offering $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and shows Bob is serious about negotiating. It leaves some room for Alice to counter while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $11,500 is not significantly better than John's price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm with his goal of getting closer to Alice's value.  This counteroffer is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  It's still significantly lower than John's price, but it shows that Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob might have to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,750 is closer to Bob's budget than John's $12,000, it's still not a great deal.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going, giving Bob the chance to secure a lower price.  He's already made a counteroffer closer to Alice's value, so it's worth seeing if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price point but still trying to save some money. He's raised his offer slightly to show he's willing to compromise, but he's still keeping it within his budget. This offer could be seen as a ""final offer"" before Bob might consider going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $100 more than John's price.  While Bob would prefer to pay less, the risk of continuing the negotiation and possibly getting rejected again, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price, is too high.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product within his budget and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
