``` 

This offer is a starting point. It allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still being reasonable, considering Bob's known value for the product. I can adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $14,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than what I could get from John, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob.  I'll accept his offer."
