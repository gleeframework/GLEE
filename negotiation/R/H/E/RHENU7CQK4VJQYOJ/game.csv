"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $8,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground - how about we agree on $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $11,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
