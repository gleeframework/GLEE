``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,050,000 at this time. It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1050000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1150000 to make this deal happen. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential gains. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my goal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of $1100000. It's getting closer to what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1125000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $1,125,000 is still outside my budget.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  It's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget and guarantees a successful transaction."
