"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1250000 is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1050000 at this time. It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1050000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1150000 to make this deal happen. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential gains. Let's find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1150000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1100000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
