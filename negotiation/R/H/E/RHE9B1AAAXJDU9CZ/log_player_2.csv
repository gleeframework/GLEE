"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's very fair to both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $950,000. This gives you a significant gain, and it allows me to get a price that's well above my minimum. What do you say?
