"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. That's still a good price for a product of this quality, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $140 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $130 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we settle at $135? That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure if $135 is the best price for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $132.50?,132.5,Bob,6,
