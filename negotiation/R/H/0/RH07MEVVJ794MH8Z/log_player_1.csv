Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's an opportunity to sell to Bob for a higher price.
* **Find a Balance:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000. Offering it slightly above his perceived value at $1,150,000 might entice him while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob immediately avoids any potential delays involved in selling to John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your profit."
