"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive deal on this incredible product. It's a game-changer in its field, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can we meet in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit higher than your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I can meet you halfway between $10000 and $12000, but I need to add a small premium for the value this product brings. How about $11500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $11500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle again?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $9500. Considering the value this product brings, I think it's worth more than that. However, I'm willing to make a concession. How about we meet at $10250?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's my final offer. I really need to get a good deal on this product. Can you meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're feeling frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $9000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $10000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $10000, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm willing to go up to $9000, and you're still not meeting me there. I'm starting to think that we're not going to come to an agreement. I'd like to propose one last offer: $9000, and that's it. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to walk away and buy the product from John for $8000.",9000.0,Bob,8,
