"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm aiming for a price that reflects that.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,400,000 vs $1,000,000). This indicates there is room for negotiation.  Since you have 10 rounds and John is offering a higher price, it's worth exploring if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still coming down on price but she's showing her willingness to negotiate.  You can try to get an even better price.  Your goal is to save as much money as possible, and John's price provides a ceiling for what you're willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects a good balance between the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant reduction from my initial asking price while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price point, but there's still room for negotiation.  She's said this is her ""final offer"", but it's likely she's willing to come down a bit more.  You still have time and John's price gives you a safety net."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,275,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to close the deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
