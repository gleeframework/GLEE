"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. It holds significant value to me, but I understand its worth might be different for you. I am offering it to you for $120. I believe this price reflects its quality and the effort put into it. Please let me know if you're interested or if you have any questions.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you understanding its value may be different to me. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $80? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I need to maintain a minimum price for the product. I am willing to negotiate, so I would like to propose $95 for the product. This price still allows me to value the product appropriately while considering your perspective. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a minimum price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $85. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a good price while giving me a deal I'm comfortable with.",85.0,Bob,4,
