"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I can't let go of this product for less than $9,000. I'm confident it can bring you even more value than that.  How about we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I think that's the best I can do. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and call it $8,750?  That's my final offer.",8750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $8,600, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",8600.0,Bob,6,
