"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is significantly higher than I had budgeted for. I would be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a fair offer considering the long-term value it offers.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are still quite far apart on price. I can appreciate there's value here, but I need to see this deal working within a more realistic budget. I could go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
