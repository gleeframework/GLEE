Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you come down a little. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's counteroffer will reveal how interested he is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** You always have the option to sell to John for $100, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is closer to his perceived value ($80) than our minimum acceptable price ($100). We have some bargaining power since we know John will buy it for $100. By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we're looking for a price closer to our initial offer and encourage him to potentially increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but the value of this product is significant. How about we meet halfway at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This approach often feels fair to both parties and implies a willingness to compromise. 
* **Above Minimum:**  We're still aiming for a price above our minimum ($100) to maximize profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge if Bob is willing to move substantially closer to our desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still looking for a way to keep costs down. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is slightly below our ideal price, it's still a profit and a better deal than selling to John for $100. Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, but it's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or Bob walking away entirely."
