"Alice,  $1100000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than $900000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000?  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
