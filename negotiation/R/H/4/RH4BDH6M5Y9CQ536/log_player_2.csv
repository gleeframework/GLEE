"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable item. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, there's no incentive to accept it. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting the offer keeps your options open in case a better deal arises."
