"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to consider a price between $12,000 and $15,000. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
