"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. How about we aim for $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down a little further to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
