Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to negotiate or feel like he's getting a slightly better deal. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net. I'm not desperate, so I can afford to aim high with Bob."
