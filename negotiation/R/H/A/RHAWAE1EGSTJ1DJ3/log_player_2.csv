"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  $9,000 represents a significant discount for Alice, while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than Bob's initial counteroffer but still within Bob's budget.  Continuing to negotiate may lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
