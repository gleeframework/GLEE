{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $10,000.
* Alice is offering it for $9,500.
* You can get it from John for $10,000.

Since John's price is only $500 more than Alice's, and you are comfortable paying up to $10,000, there's no urgency to accept Alice's offer.  You can reject it and see if Alice will counter with a lower price, or simply buy from John."
