"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum budget as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation.  A counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, signaling Bob's serious intent to buy while still being within his budget. This should encourage Alice to consider the offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. Even though it's getting closer, Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  He can still potentially get a better deal with Alice, or he can always choose to buy from John if the negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Alice has lowered her price, and Bob is now offering a price closer to Alice's last offer.  This shows that Bob is serious about making a deal, but he is still pushing for a better price within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price point.  Since Bob has 5 rounds left, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway again. This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, showing that he's willing to compromise.  It's still within Bob's budget and might be appealing enough for Alice to consider, especially with only 4 rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  With only 3 rounds left, the likelihood of Alice dropping the price significantly is slim. It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000, as he's unlikely to get a lower price from Alice within the remaining rounds."
