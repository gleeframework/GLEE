"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm starting with a price of $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll come down to $750,000. I'm confident you'll find the product valuable and worth the investment.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. Could you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $725,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet exactly in the middle of my original price and your latest offer at $775,000. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference between $775,000 and my last offer of $725,000? That puts us at $750,000. I think that's a fair and reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Bob,6,
