Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I think that's a reasonable price for the product's value to me.

While Bob is showing interest, his offers are escalating slowly and are still considerably below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that makes financial sense for me in a timely manner. Selling to John guarantees I meet my minimum acceptable price."
