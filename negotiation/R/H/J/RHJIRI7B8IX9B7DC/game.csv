"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $160. Given its high value and quality, I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $150. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further.",160.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you recognizing its value to me. While I'm definitely interested, $160 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at the moment. Would you consider $145 as a starting point for our negotiation?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",145.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to offer the product at $155, which I believe strikes a good balance between respecting its value to you and maintaining a reasonable profit margin for me. I look forward to your consideration.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm very close to your offer, but $155 is still a little more than I'd like to spend. How about we split the difference at $152.50?  I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.",152.5,Bob,4,
