,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10500. This is still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but $10500 is still a bit steep for me. How about $9800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9800 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. How about $10100?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $10100. How about we try $9900?",9900.0,Bob,6,
