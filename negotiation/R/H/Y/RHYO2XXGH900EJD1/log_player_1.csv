Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have a safety net.  Offering the product to Bob at a higher price allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price of $20,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything, as you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
