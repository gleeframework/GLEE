"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair offer considering the value this product will bring you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll pay $10,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
