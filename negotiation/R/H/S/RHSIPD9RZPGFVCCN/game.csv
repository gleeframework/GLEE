"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise.  What are your thoughts?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
