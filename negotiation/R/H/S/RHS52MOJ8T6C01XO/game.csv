"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm looking to get the best deal possible, and I'm not sure I can stretch to $11,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $10,000.  This is still a great price for a product of this value, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's make this happen.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to pay $9,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I respect that.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800, which is a great price for the value you'll get. Let's close this deal and make this happen!",9800.0,Alice,5,
