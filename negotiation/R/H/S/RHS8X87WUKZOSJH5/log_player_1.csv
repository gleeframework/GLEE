{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, hoping to create a positive atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $90 for it. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's still a decent price. However, I'm going to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100?  I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
