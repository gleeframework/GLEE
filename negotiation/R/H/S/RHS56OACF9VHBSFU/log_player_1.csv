This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It also opens the conversation and allows Bob to express his interest.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's not profitable. I'm going to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $12,500?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,800. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum, but we're getting closer. I'm going to make one last counteroffer. If he doesn't accept, I'm selling to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $12,200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a final offer of $11,900. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

While I'd like to make a bit more, Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him."
