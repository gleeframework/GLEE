"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17500. This price still reflects the value I place on this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $17500 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16000 is closer, but I'm still a bit off.  Would you consider $16500? This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair compromise and allows me to meet my own needs. Let's make this happen.",16500.0,Alice,5,
