"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $900,000. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000. I believe this price is still fair considering the value it brings to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $800,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for you.  It's well below your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John."
