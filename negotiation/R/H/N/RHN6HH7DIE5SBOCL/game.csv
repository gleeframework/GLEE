"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $900,000. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000. I believe this price is still fair considering the value it brings to me. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $800,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the value it holds for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
