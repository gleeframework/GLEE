{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's a unique piece, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a good profit. 
* **""Unique piece""**: This is a vague statement meant to pique Bob's interest and potentially increase his perceived value of the product. 
* **""What do you think?""**: This invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and encourages him to make a counteroffer. 

**Why this approach?**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially achieving a price above your minimum.
* **Encourage negotiation:** An open-ended question like ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter, keeping the negotiation alive.
* **Avoid unnecessary risk:**  You're not immediately settling for the $8,000 John is offering, giving you a chance to get more.

It's important to remember that Bob's response will determine the next steps in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.  

* **Rejecting the offer** keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try and get closer to your desired price.
* **Counteroffering** will show Bob that you're serious about getting a better price, and potentially push him to compromise.

**Next steps:**

You'll need to create a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than $8,000 but still within a reasonable range. Consider factors like:

* **How much higher than $8,000 you're willing to go:**  A small increase might be enough to get Bob to budge. 
* **Bob's financial situation:** If you think he genuinely can't afford more, you may want to make a more moderate counteroffer.
* **The product's perceived value:** If you think the product is worth more than $8,000 to Bob, you can justify a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's still a great deal for a product like this.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $9,000:** This is a compromise that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than your initial ask. It demonstrates flexibility while still trying to get a better price.
* **""Great deal for a product like this"":** This emphasizes the value of the product to try and sway Bob's decision.
* **""What do you say?""**:  This encourages Bob to respond and hopefully accept the counteroffer. 

**Why this approach?**

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, you show that you're not desperate and are willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Strike a balance:** The counteroffer is high enough to be attractive to Bob, but also low enough that you aren't settling for too little.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  This counteroffer creates an opportunity for Bob to accept or counter again, keeping the conversation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $9000. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7500. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is willing to compromise, his latest offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation and risking getting an even lower offer.  

**Why Sell to John:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Further negotiation with Bob might take more time and may not result in a better outcome.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  There's a risk that Bob will make another counteroffer that is even lower than $7,500.

This decision prioritizes a guaranteed profit over the potential for a higher price. While there's always the possibility of getting more, the potential for a lower offer or a lengthy negotiation makes selling to John the most practical option at this point."
