Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below my minimum ($150). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $145 creates the perception of a discount while still securing a profit above my minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
