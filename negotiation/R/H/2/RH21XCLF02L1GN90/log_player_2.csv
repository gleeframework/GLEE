Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $100,000 drop from her initial offer is a strong signal that I'm serious about getting a good price.  This also leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds if needed."
