"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product and believe it has potential for my business. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but it's still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value this product offers and leaves room for us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution.  While $1,250,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This compromise demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement, but I believe it's also a fair price for the value this product brings.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
