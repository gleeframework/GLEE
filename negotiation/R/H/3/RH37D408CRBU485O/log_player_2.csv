(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. You're willing to pay up to $120, so you have room to bargain."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you in the middle at $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're still willing to pay less than $105, and you have room to negotiate further. There's still a chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $108. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $108 is closer to your desired price range, you can still try to negotiate a bit lower. You have room to offer a slightly higher price than your previous counteroffer and potentially reach a deal that's more favorable for you.  It's worth trying one more time to see if you can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still hoping to land on a price that works for both of us. How about $100? It's a fair compromise, and we can both move forward."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go below $110. I think we're close, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than John's price, it's getting close to your maximum limit, and you've already rejected several counteroffers. There's a risk that Alice will continue to refuse to budge and you'll end up paying a higher price than you want.  To avoid this risk and ensure you get the product within your budget, it's better to go with John's offer at $120."
