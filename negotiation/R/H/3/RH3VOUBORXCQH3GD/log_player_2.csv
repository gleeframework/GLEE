"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. Given its value to you, I believe this price strikes a fair balance between compensating me adequately and ensuring you find the deal attractive. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  Since you can get the product for $100 from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."
