Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 with John.  Therefore, she needs to aim for a price higher than that with Bob to maximize her profit.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) is unlikely to be successful.  Alice needs to find a price point that's attractive to Bob while still providing a significant profit margin.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value,"" Alice adds perceived value to the product, making a higher price more palatable.

This strategy allows Alice to:

1. **Potentially Secure a Higher Sale:** If Bob accepts the $1,150,000 offer, Alice earns more than selling to John.
2. **Maintain a Strong Alternative:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can confidently sell to John at her desired price."
