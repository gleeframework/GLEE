"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is well above his maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for significantly less.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice first."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $10,500 for the product. This is a compromise that still reflects its value to me, while also being more reasonable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can get the product for less from John, so it's best to continue negotiating with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product, which represents a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm counteroffering $9,500 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although $9,500 is getting closer to his desired price, he can still get the product for less from John.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to get a price closer to his target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $9,250 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm counteroffering $9,400 for the product. This is a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's counteroffer of $9,400 is still above his target price of $8,000, and further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort. It's more efficient to secure the product from John at his guaranteed price."
