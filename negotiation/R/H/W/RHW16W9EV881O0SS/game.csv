"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original offer, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $9,000? That's the most I can comfortably afford.",9000.0,Bob,4,
