"Hi Bob, I understand your offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $95? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find another buyer for the product if you don't accept.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $110? It's still a good price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",110.0,Alice,5,
