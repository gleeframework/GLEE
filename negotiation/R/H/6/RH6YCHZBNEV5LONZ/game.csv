"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, but I still believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'd like to counter with an offer of $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I'm making a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to make one more concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've been willing to meet you halfway multiple times, but I think it's time for me to re-evaluate the deal. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $900000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider buying from John for $800000.",900000.0,Bob,10,
