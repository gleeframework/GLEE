"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since your goal is to save money, and John is willing to sell the product for the same price as Alice, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  You can always reject it and buy from John."
