"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds to me.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $10,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to compromise at $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and its value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
