"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still a significant amount of money, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating further."

I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $850,000 is better than $900,000, he can still potentially get a better price by negotiating further. There's room to bargain, and he can try to reach a price closer to his desired amount."
