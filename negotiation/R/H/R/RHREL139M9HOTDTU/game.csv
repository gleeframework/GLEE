"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify spending $18,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $16,000? I appreciate your understanding.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to drop down to $16,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $17,000?  It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I still believe that $17,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you perhaps lower the price to $16,500? I am willing to pay a reasonable amount for your product, but I need to stay within my budget.",16500.0,Bob,4,
