Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about $135?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $120. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5

While $127.50 is still a bit lower than I'd prefer, it's a good compromise. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
