"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit beyond my minimum.  $1,500,000 is a significant markup, but it gives me room to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my offers accordingly.  I'm also aware of John's offer as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target. It's possible Bob is just testing the waters and may be willing to go higher.  I'll counteroffer, but I won't be afraid to walk away if it's clear he's not serious."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a profit. $1,300,000 is a compromise that shows I'm serious about making a deal, but also keeps me above my minimum.  Bob's low offer in the previous round indicates he's likely to counter again, giving me more negotiation room.  I'm confident I can reach a deal that's acceptable to both of us without having to resort to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's still below what I'd ideally like, accepting it allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  It's also worth noting that we're only in round 4, leaving us with ample time to explore other options if this deal falls through.  However, given the potential for Bob to become more inflexible in future rounds, accepting his current offer seems like the most sensible decision at this point."
