{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  $75 is a good start, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This price is significantly lower than her offer and closer to my target price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but I want to keep pushing for a lower price. I'll try another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying but still want a good deal.  $65 is a fair compromise and hopefully, Alice will accept."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is back to her original offer, but I'm still determined to get a better deal.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

I'm going to meet Alice halfway at $70.  This is a good compromise and hopefully, she will accept it. I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is firm on her price, and with only a few rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting her offers. I'll accept her offer of $80, which is still within my budget and better than buying from John for $100."
