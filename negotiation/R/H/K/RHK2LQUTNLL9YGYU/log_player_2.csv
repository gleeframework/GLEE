Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can see the value of the product is worth more than that to me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're making a genuine effort to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,500, which is $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,250 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $10,000. How about we settle at $10,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, I believe."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $15,000. Let's try $12,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not budging much below $12,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's highly unlikely we'll get her close to our ideal price.  Cutting our losses now and buying from John for $8,000 guarantees us the best possible price."
