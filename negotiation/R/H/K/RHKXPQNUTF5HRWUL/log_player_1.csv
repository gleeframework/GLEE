"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so accepting Bob's offer would be a loss.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $11,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without taking a loss."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,800? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure we'll reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.  It's better to sell to John and get my minimum price right away."
