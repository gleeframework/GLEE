"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $12,000. We're confident you'll find this investment highly beneficial. Let us know if this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  As Bob, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the integrity of our product's value. Therefore, I am unable to accept your offer at $9,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500 for the product. This still reflects a premium price, but it's closer to what we initially proposed. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price. I'm hopeful I can get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still more than I can afford right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10,375 for the product. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but still lower than our initial proposal. I hope this helps us move forward towards a satisfactory agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's closer than before, I'm still determined to get the best possible price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,375 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,125 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a price that respects the value of the product while also fitting within your budget. I propose a counteroffer of $10,200 for the product. This is slightly above your last offer, but still below our initial proposal. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,200 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While we're getting closer, it's not worth risking another counteroffer and potentially running out of rounds.  John's offer is a sure thing, and it aligns perfectly with my budget.  Buying from John allows me to get the product without further negotiation and ensures I don't overspend."
