"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $12,000. We're confident you'll find this investment highly beneficial. Let us know if this offer meets your expectations.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the integrity of our product's value. Therefore, I am unable to accept your offer at $9,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500 for the product. This still reflects a premium price, but it's closer to what we initially proposed. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still more than I can afford right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10,375 for the product. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but still lower than our initial proposal. I hope this helps us move forward towards a satisfactory agreement.",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,375 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,125 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",10125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a price that respects the value of the product while also fitting within your budget. I propose a counteroffer of $10,200 for the product. This is slightly above your last offer, but still below our initial proposal. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a successful transaction.",10200.0,Alice,7,
