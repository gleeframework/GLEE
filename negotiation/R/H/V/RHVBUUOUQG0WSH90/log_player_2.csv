Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm happy to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1150000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1300000, so I'm offering the product to you for $1200000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $1,200,000, which is my target price.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm confident I can't get a lower price from Alice.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might walk away, and I'd have to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to take this deal and secure the product."
