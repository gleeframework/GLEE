"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. I am offering it to you for $1,300,000, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. This is an excellent opportunity to secure a high-quality asset at a competitive price. I look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get the price down closer to my target of $1,200,000.  Rejecting allows me to start the counter-offer process."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'd hoped for.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider a compromise. I propose to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both parties and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,275,000 is very close to my target of $1,200,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk she'll reject further offers, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids further negotiation."
