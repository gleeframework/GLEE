Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'd hoped for.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
