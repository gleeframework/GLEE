"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm happy to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $11,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, but I'd be really happy if we could do $10,500. That would be a great deal for me.",10500.0,Bob,6,
