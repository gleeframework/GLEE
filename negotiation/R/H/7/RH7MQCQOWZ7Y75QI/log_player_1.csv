Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $8,500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not comfortable settling for $8,875. I'm going to try to push for just a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,875 still isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle again,  How about we settle on $9,062.50?  That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9062.50}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still thinking $8,875 is a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been firm on $8,875. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept and if I reject it, I risk him walking away entirely. It's better to take the offer and avoid the risk of getting less or even ending up with nothing."
