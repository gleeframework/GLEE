"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still saving me a significant amount. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned the product has for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still getting a good deal.  Let's try to find common ground here.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $1,150,000, but I'm still not sure if that's enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,300,000, so I'll offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
