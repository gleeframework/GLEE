"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $11,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $10,500 for the product?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal today."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  To save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,250. This is still higher than Bob's desired price. 
* **John's offer:** $12,000.  While John's offer is higher, Bob hasn't reached his limit with Alice yet.

**Strategy:**  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  There's still room for a compromise before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,250 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,875? This price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'll offer you a price of $11,375, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible, aiming for a price closer to $10,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,375. While a slight reduction from the previous offer, it's still above Bob's desired price.
* **John's Offer:** $12,000.  Bob hasn't reached his price limit with Alice, making John's offer less appealing at this point. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to his target without needing to resort to John's offer. There's still some room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your continued flexibility,  $11,375 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product,  which is a fair price considering its value and our current negotiation. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'll offer you a price of $11,250, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product brings. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,250. While not Bob's ideal price, it's getting close to his desired range.
* **John's Offer:** $12,000. This offer is still higher than Alice's, making Alice's offer more attractive.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation might be futile.

**Strategy:**  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's within his budget and significantly lower than John's offer.  There's a good chance that rejecting and continuing to negotiate might result in Alice sticking to her final offer or even withdrawing it altogether."
