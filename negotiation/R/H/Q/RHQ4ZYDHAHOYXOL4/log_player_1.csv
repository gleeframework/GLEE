Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $8,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation. It's a good chance Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, you can adjust your counteroffers based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $9,750. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's a fair price that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close and I'm not sure if I can get a higher offer from Bob. Selling to John for $8,000 would result in a lower profit, so accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this point."
