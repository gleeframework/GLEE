Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount and a fantastic opportunity for you.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This creates a good balance between maximizing profit and incentivizing Bob to accept.
* **Strong Message:** I emphasize the value of the product and the attractive price point. This should pique Bob's interest and encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I have John as a backup buyer at my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy allows me to potentially earn a higher profit than my minimum goal while still leaving room for negotiation."
