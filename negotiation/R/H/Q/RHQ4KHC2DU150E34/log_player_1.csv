Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its value could be even higher for you in the long run."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, she should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer. Bob might be willing to go above $800,000 if he sees the value.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's potential, subtly suggesting its worth might exceed Bob's initial assessment. This can encourage him to consider a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start slightly lower (e.g., $925,000) to give more negotiation room. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell the product quickly, she might lower the price to ensure a faster deal with Bob."
