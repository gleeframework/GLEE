"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $120, and Alice's offer is exactly $120, there is no benefit to negotiating further.  Buying from John immediately guarantees you the product at your budget limit."
