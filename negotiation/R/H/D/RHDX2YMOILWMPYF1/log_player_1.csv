Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $110 is more than the $80 Bob is willing to pay, giving me some room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum of $120, ensuring I make a profit. 

By offering a slightly higher price, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially open up a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would still provide a good value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $105? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget constraint to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Fair Price:** $105 is still within Bob's range ($80 - $95) but also closer to my minimum.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to see it as a good deal. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that benefits both of us, and it might incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to consider $100 for the product, if that works for you. I believe this price strikes a good balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum of $120 and represents a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer of $95. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown of the deal.  

Here's why accepting is a good choice at this point:

* **Profit:**  Even at $100, I'm still making a profit.
* **Potential Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and could lead to John's offer becoming less viable.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price with further negotiations.

It's always important to weigh the potential benefits and risks of each option and make a decision that aligns with my overall goals. In this case, accepting Bob's offer of $100 seems like the most sensible choice."
