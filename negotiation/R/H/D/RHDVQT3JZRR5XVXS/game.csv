"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $10,500 is a bit too low for me to accept.  Could you do $12,500? I'm confident you'll find it delivers significant value at that price.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means.",11000.0,Bob,4,
