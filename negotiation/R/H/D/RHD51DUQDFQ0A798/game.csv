"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $200 represents my initial asking price, I'm open to negotiation. However, $120 is significantly below its value. Could you meet me at $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
