Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $1,400,000.  This gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for him to counter without you having to make major concessions.
* **It signals your confidence:** By starting high, you show Bob that you believe the product is valuable. 

Remember, this is just the beginning of the negotiation. You'll need to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
