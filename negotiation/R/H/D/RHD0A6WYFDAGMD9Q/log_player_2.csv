Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're running out of patience, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a free maintenance package. How about we meet at $13,500 and I'll add these extras?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer with extras is tempting, I'm running out of time and patience. I've negotiated as hard as I can, and $13,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
