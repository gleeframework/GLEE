Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the potential benefits you'll gain.
