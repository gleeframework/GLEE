"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to negotiate.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. That's my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
