Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product to Bob at $1,100,000 creates a strong incentive for him. It's significantly more than his perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a $100,000 discount compared to John's guaranteed purchase. 
* **Time Pressure:** The message creates a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 
*  Negotiation is possible. If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can still try to negotiate a price closer to $1,200,000 before moving on to John."
