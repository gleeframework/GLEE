Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1500000 is simply not a fair price for this product.  It's a unique opportunity with significant potential value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  $1600000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not quite there.  To bridge the gap, how about $1650000? This reflects the value of the product and acknowledges your financial constraints. It's a fair compromise that allows us to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.
