**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Bob seems anchored around $1,700,000-$1,800,000.  His offer of $1,750,000 is a reasonable compromise, and waiting longer risks him lowering his offer or me needing to accept John's $1,500,000. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting less later."
