Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $60 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything below my minimum of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with $70. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not quite comfortable with $75. I'd be willing to meet you at $72. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $72 is still a little below my ideal, it's getting very close and I'm running out of rounds.  I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid risking selling to John for less."
