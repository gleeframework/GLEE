Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** You're giving Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to accept. 
* **It opens the door for negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to discuss the price, allowing for a potential win-win scenario. 

This strategy allows you to maximize your potential earnings while leaving room to adapt to Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to save as much as I can. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent profit, you can likely do better. Bob is clearly motivated to buy, and you have leverage since you can sell to John for $80. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a fair price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $105? It's a fair price for me, and I think we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Profit:**  $105 is a significant profit for you, exceeding your minimum of $80 by a considerable margin. 
* **Little Room for Improvement:**  Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but it's unlikely to be much more than $105.  There's a risk that Bob could walk away, leaving you with the lower offer from John.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a stalemate. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and avoids the potential risks of further negotiation."
