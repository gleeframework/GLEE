"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000? This is a fair price that would give us both a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a good profit. I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $1,100,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm not willing to go any lower.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
