# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a good profit. I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $1,125,000, which is still above your maximum budget.  It's clear further negotiation won't lead to a better price, so it's best to take advantage of the guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000."
