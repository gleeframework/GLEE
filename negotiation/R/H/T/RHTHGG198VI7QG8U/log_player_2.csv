"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130.  I believe it's a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I'm aiming to pay much less than $130. It's worth the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, that price is a little too steep for me. How about we bring it down to $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we split the difference and settle at $107? It's a small compromise for a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but $107 is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  To be honest, $107 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $95?"",
