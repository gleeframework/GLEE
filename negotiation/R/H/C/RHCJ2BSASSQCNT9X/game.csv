"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on it, my budget allows me to pay no more than $800000 for this product. Would you consider adjusting your price accordingly?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, but I'll throw in a special deal: I'll give you a 5% discount, which brings the price down to $1140000. What do you think?",1140000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not able to meet at your proposed price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. This aligns more closely with my budget while still allowing me to acquire the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I respect your valuation of the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. This is the highest I can go within my budget, and I believe it strikes a fair balance between our interests. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1000000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my target. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000, but I need you to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've considered your latest proposal, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I propose a counteroffer of $1025000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will lead us to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1030000. This is the last price I'm willing to consider. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1030000.0,Alice,9,
