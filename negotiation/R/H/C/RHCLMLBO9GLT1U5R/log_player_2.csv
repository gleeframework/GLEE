"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that has immense potential value. While I can't disclose specifics, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a chance to acquire something truly special. Consider this offer carefully, as I have another buyer who is willing to pay the minimum value of $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget.  Bob can get the same product from John for a significantly lower price.  Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer."
