"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth $800,000 to you, but I'm willing to make a concession to sweeten the deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?

# Alice's message: I understand your target price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the product from John at your target price."
