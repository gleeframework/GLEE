"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth $800,000 to you, but I'm willing to make a concession to sweeten the deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but I can't meet that price point.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to settle around there?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your target price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
