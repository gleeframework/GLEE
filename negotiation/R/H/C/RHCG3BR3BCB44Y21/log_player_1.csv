Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While $900,000 is a good chunk of money, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  It's still early in the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1050000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I think this price is more reasonable considering the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. While $950,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for at least $1,000,000. I'll try to steer the negotiation closer to that mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I've been giving your offer serious thought. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the product's true worth while finding a point of agreement for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $975,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think this price is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** $975,000 is a significant amount, and while it's less than my ideal price, it's still a very profitable deal.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We've been going back and forth for several rounds.  Continuing to push might frustrate Bob and lead to him walking away.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, there's no guarantee another buyer will come along offering that much.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing out entirely."
