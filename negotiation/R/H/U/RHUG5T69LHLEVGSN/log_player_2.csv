"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $100.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 100 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about 92? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still saving more money by trying to negotiate a lower price.  Alice is willing to negotiate, so there's likely still room for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $92.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget though.  Would you consider $88?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can do 90, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

Alice is now offering a price of $90, which is still lower than what you'd pay for the product from John. It's a good price, so accepting the offer makes the most sense."
