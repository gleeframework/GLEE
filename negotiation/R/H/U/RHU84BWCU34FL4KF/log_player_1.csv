Bob's offer:

While $1,650,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price at this time.  My final offer is $1,700,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial asking price and reflects my desire to see this product in the hands of someone who recognizes its potential."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,700,000. I'm willing to make one more offer: $1,600,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go higher and $1,600,000 is a significant profit over my minimum. It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing him entirely."
