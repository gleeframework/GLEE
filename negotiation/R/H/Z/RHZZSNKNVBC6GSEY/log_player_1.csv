"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still high enough to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value of $80. If he rejects this offer, I'll know I need to come down further, but I don't want to start too low and leave myself with little room to maneuver. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  Starting with a friendly message keeps the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I still see potential for negotiation. I'll try to bring him up to a more acceptable price in the following rounds.
* **John's Offer:**  Although John is a guaranteed buyer for $150, I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. I believe there's a chance I can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $110. That gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my previous offer, but not too much. 
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""good deal"" for Bob and the profit for me to make the offer more appealing.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $110 is still above Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not comfortable selling for that amount yet.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer is significantly better, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  
* **Negotiation Continues:** However, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to try to push him a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle at $102.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. This shows a commitment to compromise and could increase the likelihood of agreement.
* **Positive Language:** I continue to use positive language to maintain a friendly tone and encourage a deal.
* **Pressure Increase:** While I still have 5 rounds, I'm starting to feel the pressure of John's offer.  I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob before I have to consider his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $98.75. Let's finalize this deal and get this product in my hands! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, the pressure to make a decision is increasing. 
* **Low Offer:**  $98.75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John's offer of $150 is a guaranteed sale and a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high. I need to secure the sale and John is my safest option at this point."
