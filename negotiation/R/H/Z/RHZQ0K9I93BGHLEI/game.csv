"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,350,000? This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close the deal quickly. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,
