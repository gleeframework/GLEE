"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a fair price.  Would you be interested in paying $120 for it?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but lower than Bob's perceived value of $150. 
* **Positive and optimistic:** I'm using friendly language to build rapport and make Bob feel like this is a good opportunity.
* **Setting the stage:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make him more likely to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'm still confident that Bob values the product at $150 and I'm willing to negotiate further. There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit low for me, considering the value this product holds for you. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That gives us both a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still above my minimum.
* **Highlight the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to encourage him to come up a bit.
* **Fairness and win-win:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my goal:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price range. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and potentially going down to John's $80 offer outweighs the potential reward.
* **Time is money:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's more efficient to secure a good price now rather than risk further negotiation."
