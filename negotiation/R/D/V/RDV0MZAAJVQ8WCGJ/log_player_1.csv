Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Our Minimum:** We won't sell for less than $1,000,000 because we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.

The offer of $1,350,000:

* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, but we have a strong starting point.
* **Significant Gain for Bob:**  Bob still gets a $150,000 benefit compared to his perceived value. 
* **Excellent Profit for Alice:** Alice secures a $350,000 profit over her minimum sale price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob sees enough value to accept the offer."
