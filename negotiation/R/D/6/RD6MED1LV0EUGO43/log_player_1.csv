"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This sets a strong initial expectation and allows room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so starting high gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $500,000 is a significant sum, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.  I have a solid fallback option with John, which gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I receive a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is inching closer to my minimum acceptable price, $600,000 is still below it. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better price. I still have the safety net of selling to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to offer $850,000.  This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's latest offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value. My goal is to find a point where Bob might see value in accepting the offer, while I still secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer,  $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. I'm running out of time, but I still have the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Given that we're nearing the end of our negotiations, and I have a guaranteed alternative with John, I'm going to see if Bob will accept this offer.  It's a gamble, but I believe the potential reward is worth the risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed Bob won't come up to my minimum price of $800,000, I'm running out of time. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000, ensuring I meet my minimum acceptable price and don't risk losing out on a deal completely."
