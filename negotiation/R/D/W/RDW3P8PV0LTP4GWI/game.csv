"Alice,  $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $11000? It's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal. Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $9500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $9500 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  How about $10000? This is a fair price and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",10000.0,Bob,6,
