"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
