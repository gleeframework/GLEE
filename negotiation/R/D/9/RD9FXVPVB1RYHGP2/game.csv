"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for the product.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
