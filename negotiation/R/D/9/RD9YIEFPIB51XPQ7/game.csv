"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85? It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a bit more, but $95 is still a stretch for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $90.  This is a fair price that will allow us to both walk away happy.",90.0,Bob,4,
