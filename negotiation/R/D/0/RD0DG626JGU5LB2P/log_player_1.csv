I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  

I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value of $10,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,000. This is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I believe it's a fair price that still allows for some profit while showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

Bob has come back with the same offer of $8,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, this is still a better deal than selling to John. I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale."
