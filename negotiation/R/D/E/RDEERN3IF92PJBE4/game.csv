"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1100000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $950000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $950000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1025000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
