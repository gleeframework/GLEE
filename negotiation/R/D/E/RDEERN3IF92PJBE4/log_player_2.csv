"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Alice's offer is above your maximum price. You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $950000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1025000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Even though it's closer to your target price, John is offering the product at your exact maximum price.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice when you can secure the product for your limit with John."
