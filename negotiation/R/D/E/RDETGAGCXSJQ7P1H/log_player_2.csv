"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I can try to negotiate a lower price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider $5,000? I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiation."",
 ""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer allows room for negotiation while still staying under my $8,000 limit. It's a bold move, but it signals that I'm serious about buying at a price that works for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $5,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows you to stay within your budget. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is now closer to my budget, but I'm still $1,000 away from John's offer. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $7,000? That would make this a great deal for me and hopefully still be worthwhile for you."",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm aiming for a price point closer to John's offer while still leaving some room for Alice to counter if she's willing. This approach keeps the negotiation moving and puts me in a strong position to either secure a deal with Alice or go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a little further. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum value. How about we settle on $10,000? This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice seems unlikely to go much lower than $10,000. At this point, accepting her offer would mean paying $2,000 more than John's price.  It's time to cut negotiations short and buy from John to stay within my budget."
