"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider $5,000? I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiation.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $5,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows you to stay within your budget. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $7,000? That would make this a great deal for me and hopefully still be worthwhile for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a little further. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum value. How about we settle on $10,000? This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,5,
