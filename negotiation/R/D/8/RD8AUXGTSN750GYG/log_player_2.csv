Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value you place on this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  While $950,000 is closer to what I need, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still allowing me to earn a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000.  It's in your best interest to secure the product for the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk Alice not budging further."
