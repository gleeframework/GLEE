Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $1,500,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he gets. This helps establish a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Target a ""win-win"":**  By offering a price that's attractive to Bob while still exceeding my minimum, I aim for a deal where we both get something we want.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value allows for some bargaining without making me feel pressured to compromise too much.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The threat of selling to John for a higher price adds a sense of urgency to Bob's decision, motivating him to accept a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me. While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much profit. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my commitment to getting a better price. 
* **Continue negotiation:**  By making a counteroffer, I can try to reach a compromise that's closer to my desired price. 
* **Threat of John:** The knowledge that I can sell to John for a higher price strengthens my position in the negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value you place on this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but represents a compromise from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him that a higher price is justified. 
* **Win-win framing:** I'm positioning this price as a win for both of us, highlighting the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement. 
* **Negotiation space:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if needed, allowing for a potential compromise on a price that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** My counteroffer is still above Bob's desired price, demonstrating my firmness in getting a fair deal.
* **Incremental approach:**  By reducing the price in increments, I'm creating a sense of progress and making a deal more likely. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a professional and positive tone, encouraging a constructive conversation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high. Would you be willing to settle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
