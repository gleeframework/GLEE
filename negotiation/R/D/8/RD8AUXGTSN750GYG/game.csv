,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value you place on this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high. Would you be willing to settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  While $950,000 is closer to what I need, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still allowing me to earn a fair profit. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
