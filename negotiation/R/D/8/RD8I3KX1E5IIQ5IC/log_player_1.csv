Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we can then try to lower the price slightly, but keeping in mind the minimum value we're willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  We'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

We're lowering our price slightly from our initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's perceived value. This shows flexibility while trying to maintain a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has offered $9,500 which is closer to our minimum acceptable price.  It's still below our target price, but continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing him as a buyer and forcing us to sell to John at our minimum acceptable price. Therefore, it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
