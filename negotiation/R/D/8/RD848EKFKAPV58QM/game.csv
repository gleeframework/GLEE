"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your budgetary constraints. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $100. This reflects the value we place on our product and acknowledges your willingness to pay a premium for quality. I hope this revised offer meets within your budget while still allowing us to fairly compensate for the product's value.",100.0,Alice,3,
