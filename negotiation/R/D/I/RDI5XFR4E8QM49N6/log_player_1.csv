Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value and gives you a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. If he rejects, you can adjust your price based on his counteroffer."
