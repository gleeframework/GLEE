"I'm really interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is a good middle ground, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think $950000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $990000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the product's value to you.",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $990000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,6,
