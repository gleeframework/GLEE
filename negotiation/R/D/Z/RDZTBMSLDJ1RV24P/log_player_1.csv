I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I believe this is a fair price that gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to earn a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $11,000. This is still a good deal for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating a fair price. Hopefully, he'll find this counteroffer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has come up slightly in his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I can secure a much better deal with John. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
