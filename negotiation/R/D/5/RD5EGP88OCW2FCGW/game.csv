"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,000,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I think that's a fair price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
