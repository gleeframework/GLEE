"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's worth discussing a price of $20,000, which I think is a fair reflection of its value to you.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, the price of $20,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $13,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to stretch my budget if we can agree on this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're not making much progress.  I can go up to $14,000, but that's my absolute limit. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach your limit, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $18,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,7,
