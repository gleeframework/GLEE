Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds promising, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it,  considering its potential value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate while still staying within your budget. It's a reasonable starting point for a back-and-forth."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm open to negotiations and willing to consider a slightly lower price. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
