"Alice, your product sounds promising, but $1200000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it,  considering its potential value. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm open to negotiations and willing to consider a slightly lower price. Let's discuss further.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
