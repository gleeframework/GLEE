Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?

Round 5

Otherwise, I might need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit on this deal. I can offer you a one-time exception and meet you at $815,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in some additional support and training. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and we're getting pretty close to my absolute limit. Accepting at $815,000 secures a significant discount and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
