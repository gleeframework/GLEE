"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, my budget limit for this product is $800,000. If you're able to meet me at that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit on this deal. I can offer you a one-time exception and meet you at $815,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in some additional support and training. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
