"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm serious about buying it. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $13,000 either. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While I appreciate the compromise, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $16,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $14,000 either. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $15,500. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
