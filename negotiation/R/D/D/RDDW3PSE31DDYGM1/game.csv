"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. It's incredibly valuable, and I believe it would significantly benefit you.  I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000 to give you a starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand you want a fair deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move things forward, I'm proposing $2,000,000. This reflects the product's worth while still allowing room for negotiation.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However,  $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours? That would be $1,775,000.  It reflects the product's value while recognizing your interest.",1775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $1,775,000 is still pushing it. How about $1,600,000? That's a significant move on my part.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
