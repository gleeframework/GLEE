"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  I'm really hoping to make this deal work.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13,000, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about $12,500?  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow me to buy the product within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500 just yet. I can do $13,250, which is still a great deal for you. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
