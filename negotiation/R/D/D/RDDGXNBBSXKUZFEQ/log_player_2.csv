"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible and Alice's offer is above his limit.  It's best to start negotiating and see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  I'm really hoping to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13,000, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save money, and Alice's offer is still above his limit.  He should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about $12,500?  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow me to buy the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500 just yet. I can do $13,250, which is still a great deal for you. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to budge on the price, and Bob has only 5 rounds left. At this point, Bob should buy from John and avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice within the remaining rounds. While Bob might be able to save some money with further negotiations, the guaranteed $12,000 price from John is a safer option."
