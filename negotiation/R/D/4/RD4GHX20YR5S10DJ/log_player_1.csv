"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $115, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message might encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking for Bob's opinion invites a response and potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still some room to negotiate upwards.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiations.
* **Selling to John is an Option:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $120, but I'm hoping to get a slightly higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know if that's something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $115 to $110.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm not losing money.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Small Increment:** Bob's increase from $105 to $108 is minimal. It suggests he might be willing to go a little higher.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  I can still sell to John for $120, so I'm not in a rush to close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence. While I'm happy to work with you,  $108 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference - $110 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  This tactic shows a willingness to meet halfway, making the offer more appealing.
* **Maintain Value:**  $110 is still a good price for me, well above my minimum.
* **Reinforce Fairness:** The message emphasizes fairness and emphasizes a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still trying to save some money. I'm willing to pay $107 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are approaching the halfway point of the 10 rounds. 
* **Small Increases:** Bob's offers are increasing slowly, and it's unlikely he will significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds.
* **John is the Safe Bet:**  John is willing to pay $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer and meets my minimum requirements. It's a guaranteed profit and less risky than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
