"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $9,500. What are your thoughts?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $9,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $9,200. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need the price to be a bit lower. Would you consider $8,700?  That's a reasonable compromise.",8700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can offer you a price of $9,100. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,100 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,900? This would be my final offer.",8900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way to $8,900, Bob. I can offer you a price of $9,050, which is a small increase from my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",9050.0,Alice,9,
