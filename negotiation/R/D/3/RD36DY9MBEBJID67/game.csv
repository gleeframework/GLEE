"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product has value, but I can only pay up to $10000 for it. Would you consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. However, $10000 is significantly below what I need to make this work. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $11500. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still can't go above $10000 for the product. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 simply doesn't work for me.  To be honest, I'm getting close to selling to another buyer who's willing to pay a fair price.  However, I value your interest and am willing to make one final concession. I'll drop to $11000, but this is my absolute last offer. If you're serious about buying, this is your chance.",11000.0,Alice,5,
