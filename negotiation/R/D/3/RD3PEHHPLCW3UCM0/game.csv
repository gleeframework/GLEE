"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While $900000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $800000.  Let me know if that's something you'd be open to discussing.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your target price is $800000, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I know this product holds. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
