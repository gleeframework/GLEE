"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is too high.  Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $100, and the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's original offer, but it's still within the range where both of us could benefit. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still a bit too high, but it shows she's willing to negotiate. We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still stuck at $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $85. It's a reasonable price for both of us, and I'm hoping Alice will finally accept it. I'm willing to be firm but fair in this negotiation."
