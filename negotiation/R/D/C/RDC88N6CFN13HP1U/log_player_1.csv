"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $110 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my asking price, but still within a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $125?  That's still a great deal for a product worth $120 to you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $120.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm running out of time, I'm still determined to get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a price that's closer to his offer, but hopefully still a good deal for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have other options, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $115 to you. How about $120? That's the price John is willing to pay, and it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
