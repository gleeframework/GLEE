"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and unique features, I think it's worth more than $150. However, I understand value perception varies. Considering its true worth and your potential satisfaction, I propose we strike a deal at $120. This price not only ensures you get exceptional value but also allows me to fairly compensate for the cost and effort invested in providing this product. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
