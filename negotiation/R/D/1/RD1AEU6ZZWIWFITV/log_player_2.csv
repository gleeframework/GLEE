"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is offering $1,100,000. This is a significant overpayment. It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can get a better deal through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too high for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $975,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than the initial one, it's still above your target price of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it's still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is enough to compensate for the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to get a lower price.  You can try one more counteroffer before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a significant amount for me. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $910,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm afraid it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to walking away from the deal. I'm offering you the product for $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, you've already had 6 rounds of negotiation and haven't managed to get the price below $900,000. Given you have only 4 rounds left, and the risk of Alice walking away, it's probably best to buy the product from John for $800,000.  It's a guaranteed price and will save you a lot of time and effort."
