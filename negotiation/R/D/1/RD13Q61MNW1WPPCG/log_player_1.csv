Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It also provides a reason for the price, highlighting the product's value to Bob. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While $80 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John. I will counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John and it avoids the risk of further negotiation.  It's also a good compromise and allows for a smooth transaction."
