"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,750,000. This adjustment reflects the product's true worth and potential for significant returns."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This price seems more reasonable to me, considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move significantly higher than his $1,300,000 offer. Accepting his offer means losing out on a potential $200,000 profit. Selling to John guarantees the full $1,500,000 value, making it the most profitable decision at this point."
