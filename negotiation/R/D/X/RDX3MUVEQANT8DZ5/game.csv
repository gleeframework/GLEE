"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer.
