Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, given its value to me. This price is still above what I could get from another seller, so it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
