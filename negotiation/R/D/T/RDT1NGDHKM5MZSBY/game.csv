"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, given its value to me. This price is still above what I could get from another seller, so it's a win-win for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,250,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and my original asking price of $1,500,000.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it leaves some room for you to make a profit.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,300,000. Considering the value of the product to you and my original asking price, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,315,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1315000.0,Alice,5,
