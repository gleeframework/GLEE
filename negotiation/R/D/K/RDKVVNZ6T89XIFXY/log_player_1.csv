Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for potential negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price. 

While this is a strong opening offer, be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects the initial price. You can always gradually lower it, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
