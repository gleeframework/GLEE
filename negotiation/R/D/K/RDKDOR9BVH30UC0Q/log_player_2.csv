"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's something that I'm confident would be worth at least $1,000,000 to you, just as it is to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to both of us.  Let me know what you think.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is slightly higher than John's, it's still within your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or confirm that John's offer is the best available."
