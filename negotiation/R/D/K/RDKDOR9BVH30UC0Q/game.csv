"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's something that I'm confident would be worth at least $1,000,000 to you, just as it is to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to both of us.  Let me know what you think. ",1050000.0,Alice,1,
