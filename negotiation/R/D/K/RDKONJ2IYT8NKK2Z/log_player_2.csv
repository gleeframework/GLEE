"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,400,000.  I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price.  There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This still allows for a good profit for you, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This allows for a reasonable profit for me and still represents a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,350,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,500,000.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice moved from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, showing flexibility. Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,300,000 was rejected, suggesting $1,350,000 is a reasonable middle ground.
* **Time is a factor:**  The negotiation is already in round 3, and with only 7 rounds remaining, it's risky to continue haggling. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product without risking further delays or having to buy from John at a higher price."
