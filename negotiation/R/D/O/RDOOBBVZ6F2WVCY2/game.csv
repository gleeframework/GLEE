,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $60 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget. How about $75? That's a fair price, and it would allow me to get the product from you.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $85? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
