"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize my potential profit while also giving Bob a good starting point.  Let's see if we can strike a deal in these 10 rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a little too high for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95,  which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to my desired price point while still showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will lead to a deal in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $90 is a good price for me, as it's above my minimum of $80 and close to the middle ground we were aiming for.  It's also better than selling to John for $80.  It's a win-win for both of us!"
