Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I consider other offers.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so aiming for a price close to that maximizes your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasize the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential return on his investment. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other offers (even if John is your fallback) can encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's negotiation style. If you know he's a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* This focuses on maximizing your immediate profit. If building a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price."
