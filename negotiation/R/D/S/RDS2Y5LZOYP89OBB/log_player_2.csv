"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Reasoning: Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum price of $150. It's a good deal, and there's no reason to risk getting a higher counteroffer from Alice or ending up paying John $150."
