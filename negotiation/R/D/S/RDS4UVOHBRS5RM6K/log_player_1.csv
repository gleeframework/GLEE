Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be a great fit for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price above your minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the security of John's offer ($12,000), so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering me for the product. I appreciate the offer, but based on my budget, I am only able to offer $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than your minimum ($12,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're looking for a higher price and open the door for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value that I'm confident justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This approach often feels fair to both parties in a negotiation. 
* **Above Minimum:** This counteroffer ensures you're still aiming for a price above your absolute minimum, maximizing your potential profit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Bob's reaction will indicate how much further he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects this offer, you can still accept his original $10,000 or proceed with John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but given my budgetary constraints, I can't agree to $12,500. I would like to propose $11,000 as a compromise. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** While not ideal, $11,000 is still a profit above your absolute minimum of $12,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting his offer secures a reasonable profit.
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now saves you the time and effort of potentially lengthy negotiations with Bob or finding another buyer."
