"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me halfway?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $13000 is still a bit below my target. I'm sure you understand I have other potential buyers, including one who is willing to pay my asking price.  I'm open to meeting you halfway, so how about $13500? It's a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13200, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer?",13200.0,Bob,4,
