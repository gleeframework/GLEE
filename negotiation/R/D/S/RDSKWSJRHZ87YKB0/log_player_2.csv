Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $13000 is still a bit below my target. I'm sure you understand I have other potential buyers, including one who is willing to pay my asking price.  I'm open to meeting you halfway, so how about $13500? It's a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's make this happen!
