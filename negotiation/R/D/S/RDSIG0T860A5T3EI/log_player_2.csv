"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower price:**  Bob is offering a lower price than Alice's initial offer, aiming to save money.
* **Fair price:**  The counteroffer is still above Alice's value of $8000, making it potentially acceptable to her.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and expresses interest, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9500? It's a fair compromise and still leaves you a good amount of value.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's offer is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still above her value for the product, making it a good deal for both parties.
* **Saving Money:**  Bob is saving $2,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting the offer avoids further negotiation rounds and ensures a swift transaction."
