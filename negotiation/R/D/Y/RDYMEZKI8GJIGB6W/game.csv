"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",13000.0,Alice,3,
