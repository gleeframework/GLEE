(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. I have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain.  I'll reject and see if I can get closer to my goal of saving as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% reduction from Alice's initial price.  This is a bold move, but it demonstrates my intent to negotiate aggressively.  I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing a deal quickly, even at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get a better deal, given the number of rounds remaining.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to secure a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing flexibility while still aiming for a significant saving.  This counteroffer demonstrates I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not desperate to buy at Alice's price. Hopefully, this will lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but we're still a little apart.  However, we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I need to weigh the risk of continuing to bargain.  If I reject this offer, I risk Alice hardening her stance and pushing the price back up. Also, it is still better than the price I can get from John. I'll accept the offer and secure a decent deal."
