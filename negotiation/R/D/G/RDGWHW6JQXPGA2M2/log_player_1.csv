"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you be able to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is the same as John's offer, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $17,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, I can't come down to $15,000 at this point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe we can find a better solution. I would like to propose $14,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting further away from my desired price. While I'm open to negotiation, his latest offer is too low, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. To guarantee I don't lose out on a higher price, I will sell to John, as his offer is still higher than Bob's."
