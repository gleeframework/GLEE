Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  While it's below your minimum, it gives Bob room to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly, but you still have plenty of wiggle room to stay above your minimum.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate:** Showing flexibility from the start can encourage Bob to engage in a constructive conversation. 

Remember, the key is to find a price that maximizes your profit while also encouraging Bob to accept. Keep in mind that you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still aim for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $1,075,000? This would allow me to move forward with the sale while still giving you a great deal on such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your costs, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Could you consider $1,060,000 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,060,000 is still below your desired price, it is only $10,000 away from your minimum.  Considering the possibility of further negotiations leading to a stalemate or Bob walking away, it's likely in your best interest to accept his offer and secure a sale."
