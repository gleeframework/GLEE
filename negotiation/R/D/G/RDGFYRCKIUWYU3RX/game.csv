"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $1,075,000? This would allow me to move forward with the sale while still giving you a great deal on such a valuable product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
