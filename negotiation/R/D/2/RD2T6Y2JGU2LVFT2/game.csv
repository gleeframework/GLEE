"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I can offer the product to you for $10500.

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $10000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I can offer the product to you for $11000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
