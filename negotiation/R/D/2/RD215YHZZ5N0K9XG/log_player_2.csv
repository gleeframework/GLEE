"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $100 to me, I'm willing to pay up to that amount. Alice's offer of $50 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $40, which is still a good deal for Alice since she's likely looking to get more than $50 for the product. This counteroffer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I'd still prefer to pay $40, accepting at $45 is a good compromise and saves me $55 compared to buying from John.  It's also worth considering that continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or Alice becoming less willing to negotiate further."
