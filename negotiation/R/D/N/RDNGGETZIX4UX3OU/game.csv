"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I can do $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a one-time offer, so think carefully!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I can do $11,250, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
