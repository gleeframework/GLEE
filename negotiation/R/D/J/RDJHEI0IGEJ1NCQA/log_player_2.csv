"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $140
* **Your Maximum:** $150
* **John's Price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
