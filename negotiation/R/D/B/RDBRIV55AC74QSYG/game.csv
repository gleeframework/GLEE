"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal considering its value to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about $725,000?  This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
