"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750000.  This reflects the significant savings I'm hoping to achieve compared to purchasing from John. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $825000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,3,
