# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $825000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll become less flexible. It's a substantial savings compared to John's offer, and the product is valuable to me. I'm willing to accept the offer and close the deal."
