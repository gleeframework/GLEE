Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750000.  This reflects the significant savings I'm hoping to achieve compared to purchasing from John. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
