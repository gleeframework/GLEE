"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?  I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,200. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,200 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
