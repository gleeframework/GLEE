"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but still lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, encouraging Bob to participate in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's also too far below my initial offer of $175, making it unlikely he'll be willing to negotiate up significantly.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $80 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $125. This still reflects the value I'm placing on it, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that the price reflects the value of the product to me, encouraging Bob to see the value in my offer.
* **Openness:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking Bob what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and allows me to avoid further negotiation. While I could try to get a higher price, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and potentially walking away is too high.  It's better to secure the deal at my minimum price than risk losing the sale entirely."
