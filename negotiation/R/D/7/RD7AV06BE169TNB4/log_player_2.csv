"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**  There's no benefit to negotiating with Alice. You're already at your maximum price point, and John offers the product at the same price. Buying from John saves you the time and effort of potentially going through multiple rounds of negotiation."
