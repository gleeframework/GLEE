Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** The offer of $1,150,000 is a strong compromise:
    * It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) so he'd be getting a good deal if he values it higher.
    * It's still a very profitable amount for me, netting an extra $150,000 over my guaranteed sale.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to act quickly."
