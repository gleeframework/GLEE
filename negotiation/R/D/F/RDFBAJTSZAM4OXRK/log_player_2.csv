You have three options:

You're better off rejecting Alice's offer. You can do better than $10,000.  Let's see if you can get closer to your $8,000 target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your target price of $8,000. You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and it seems Alice is firm on her price.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal from John and secure the product for your desired price."
