"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'll be watching closely to see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's last offer. It's a fair price point that acknowledges the value of the product for both of us, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is getting closer to my minimum, I still want to see if I can push for a higher price. There's a good chance Bob will be willing to go up a bit more to close the deal, especially since he's rejected my last two offers. I'm going to stick with my goal of maximizing my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm going to counter with $145.  We're getting close to the $150 mark, and it's important to get this deal done. This offer is a small step up from Bob's last offer, but it's still within a range that is reasonable for both of us. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a fair compromise and accepts."
