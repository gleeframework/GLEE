"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I've done some research and believe it would be a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value we both place on it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and the value you've expressed interest in it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which is a significant amount considering the value I place on it.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
