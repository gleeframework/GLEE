"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a decent profit.  It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer**.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price and see if I can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** again.  While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to try to get a higher price and see if I can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  I appreciate your offer, but $9,200 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go down to $9,350. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,350. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, but that's my final offer. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to **sell the product to John for $12,000**.  

Bob and I are getting closer to a deal, but the price is still below my minimum. With only four rounds left, I don't have time to continue this back-and-forth.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the best choice for me right now."
