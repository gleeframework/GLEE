```"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, but I'm willing to throw in an extra $20 for a bundled service that I think would really enhance the product's value. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While the additional $20 for a bundled service is tempting, I still want to try to get closer to my desired price of $130. I think I can continue to negotiate with Bob and reach a more mutually agreeable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, and I'll throw in the bundled service as we discussed. Can you meet me halfway and meet me at $126.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Even though it's a little below my desired price of $128, the bundled service makes it a worthwhile deal. This ensures I secure a good price for the product and potentially earn more through the additional service. It's also important to acknowledge that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and the risk of losing the deal completely becomes more significant."
