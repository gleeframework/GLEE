"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both some room to negotiate.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, but I think I can do better than that. Can we try to get closer to $10,500?",10800.0,Bob,6,
