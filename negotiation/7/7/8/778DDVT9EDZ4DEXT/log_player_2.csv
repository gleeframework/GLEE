You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth it to accept Alice's offer at $12,000, as that's above your budget.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try to negotiate a better price or to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the realm of what you're willing to pay."

Alice's offer is still above your budget. You can try to negotiate further, but ultimately you can still buy the product from John at $8,000.  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further."

This counteroffer is a compromise between your desired price and Alice's offer. It's worth seeing if she's willing to move closer to your budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you've already made several counteroffers.  It's unlikely she'll come down much further.  It's time to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
