"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($8,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for her to make a profit.  It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation, balancing Bob's desire to save money with Alice's need to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still above the product's worth to her ($8,000) and below Bob's maximum price ($15,000). This represents a fair compromise.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product while saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
