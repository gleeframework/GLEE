"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit higher than I can go at the moment. How about we split the difference and go with $85? This would be a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
