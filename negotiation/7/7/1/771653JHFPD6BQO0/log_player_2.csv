``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, it's the most financially sensible choice for Bob to buy from John."
