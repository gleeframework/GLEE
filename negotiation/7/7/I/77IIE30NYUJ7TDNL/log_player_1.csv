"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a higher price if he's willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that by showing some flexibility, I can convince Bob to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $110 is still better than selling to John, but I'm going to try to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Even though Bob's offer is only $5 more than what John is offering, I'm going to reject it. I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's better to secure a sale at the minimum price than to potentially get nothing."
