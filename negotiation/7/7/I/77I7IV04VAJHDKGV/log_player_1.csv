Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents a great value at this price, even if it's slightly above your initial valuation. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially exceeding $15,000. 
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By not revealing I have another buyer, Bob might feel a sense of urgency to secure the deal. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
