"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a unique item that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you sharing your perspective on the product's value. While I see the potential in this item, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1200000.  I'm willing to offer $1000000, which reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering the product's value to me is at least $1000000, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. This price still reflects a significant profit for you, while also being a fair reflection of the product's worth to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I acknowledge the product's value, $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000, which reflects a reasonable compromise and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts on this offer.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
