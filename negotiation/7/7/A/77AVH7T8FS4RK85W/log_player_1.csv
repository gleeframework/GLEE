{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that's slightly above Bob's value for the product. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but still leaves room for negotiation if he rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept $10,000, it's below my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $11,000?  That's still a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's important to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
