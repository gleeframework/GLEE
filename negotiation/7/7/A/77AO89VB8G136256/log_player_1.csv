Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This allows room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll end up closer to your desired outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By offering it at $120, even if Bob counteroffers lower, there's a chance to negotiate down to a price above your minimum of $100.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $100.  This knowledge gives you confidence in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. You have room to negotiate further, and there's a chance you can reach a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that often feels fair to both parties. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** The price of $105 is still above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you make a profit if Bob accepts.
* **Testing Bob's Limit:**  This counteroffer will help you understand how much Bob is willing to pay and if a deal is possible within your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to accommodate my budget. However, I would like to propose a price of $95 if that's possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still not reaching your minimum price of $100.  It seems unlikely he'll go above $95. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $100, it's in your best interest to take the sure thing and maximize your profit."
