"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but not ridiculously high. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $80 to me. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a good offer, I'm hoping for something a bit closer to $90. Would you be willing to come up a little?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $85? Would you be willing to compromise at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $85 is a good compromise and still above my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more, especially with John's offer as a backup."
