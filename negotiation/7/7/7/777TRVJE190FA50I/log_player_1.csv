"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium above my minimum value of $1,500,000. This strategy has a few advantages:

* **Sets a high bar:** It establishes my expectation for the product's value and incentivizes Bob to negotiate.
* **Room for compromise:** It gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.
* **Time pressure:** If Bob isn't willing to meet my price, I can always turn to John, so I'm not desperate.

Let's see what Bob's response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,800,000 is a good price, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this shows a willingness to negotiate while also pushing for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,700,000 is a decent price, we are close enough to my desired price that I want to continue to negotiate for a better deal. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,850,000.  This is a slight decrease from my last offer but still above Bob's offer. We're getting closer to a deal, and I want to keep the pressure on Bob to come up to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,650,000 is a good price, I'm still only two rounds away from selling to John for $1,500,000. I believe I can get a better price from Bob with two more rounds of negotiation. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up in his next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my last offer, and I'm getting close to Bob's last offer. I believe this is a fair compromise given that we only have three rounds left. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We only have two rounds left and I'm determined to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer and see if he's willing to meet me in the middle. If he doesn't, I'll still have the option to sell to John in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,650,000. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, and I'm hopeful he'll accept it. We only have one round left, so I need to make a decision. I'm willing to close the deal at this price, but I'll also be prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is the final round, and while I would prefer to sell for a higher price,  $1,550,000 is a good outcome. It's above my minimum value and a decent profit.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
