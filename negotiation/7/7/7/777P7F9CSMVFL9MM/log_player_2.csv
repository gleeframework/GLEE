"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a unique and valuable asset.  I believe the market value of this product is significantly higher than $1500000, but I'm starting with a competitive price of $1400000. This represents a great opportunity for you to secure a valuable asset at a favorable price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above my maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John.  There are still 9 rounds left to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** I'm aiming for a significant price reduction, but I'm not going too low.  $1,200,000 still leaves some room for negotiation, and it's a strong starting point.
* **Clear Justification:** I'm emphasizing my budget constraint and presenting my offer as a fair compromise. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and counteroffers."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $1200000.  While I understand your budget constraints, this product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will generate a strong return on investment for you.

Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has come down in price, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. There's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer. It's important to keep pushing for a lower price while still maintaining a cordial and professional tone."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,300,000 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and my budget.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm taking Alice's offer seriously, but not conceding too much.

* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative approach, even though we're still in negotiation."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued interest.  While $1250000 is closer,  I'm still committed to achieving a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $1275000. This price represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I'm confident this will prove to be a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still higher than my desired price.  With several rounds remaining, I believe I can still push for a lower price, perhaps by meeting halfway between our current positions.  It's worth trying to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,250,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. $1,275,000 is getting very close to what I can afford. However, I'm still hoping to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,262,500. This price represents a significant opportunity for you to secure a sale while still staying within my budget constraints.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1262500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between our last two offers. This shows that I'm taking her counteroffer seriously and am committed to finding a compromise.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting the fact that my offer benefits both of us, allowing Alice to secure a sale while I get a good deal.
* **Reinforcing Budget Constraint:**  I'm reminding Alice about my budget limitations to make it clear that this is my final offer."
