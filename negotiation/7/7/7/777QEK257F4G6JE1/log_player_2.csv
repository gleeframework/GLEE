Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too far below what the product is worth to me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for the value I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price.  I'm still a ways off from that number though.  How about $950,000?  That's a substantial sum and demonstrates my serious interest in the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 as a final compromise.  This is a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach a number that beats John's offer of $1,000,000.  She's still over $100,000 away and has indicated this is her ""final compromise."" It's time to cut bait and secure the guaranteed good deal with John."
