Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is closer to a workable range, I still need a bit more to make this work. How about we settle at $13,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
