Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My floor:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't go below that.
* **Bob's ceiling:** He values the product at $12,000, so he won't go above that. 
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves a $3,000 negotiation space.
* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is halfway between our values. This is a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and try to meet in the middle. I'm prepared to keep negotiating until I reach a mutually agreeable price or decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob is offering $12,500, which is still below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation space:** While it's closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John would guarantee me $15,000, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target. I will consider his budget and try to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $12,500.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My previous offer was $14,000, and Bob's offer is $12,500.  Meeting halfway at $13,250 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Maintaining my position:** This offer still gives me a profit, as my minimum value is $15,000.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating flexibility and commitment to reaching a deal. 
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the fair price and the value of the product to encourage acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** We have a deal! 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to re-evaluate my options. I might consider lowering my price slightly more, or I might decide to sell to John if Bob continues to be too far below my desired price."
