"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little too high for me.  How about $105? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close!  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm still aiming for $100.  Would you be willing to go down to $103?  That's a fair compromise, and I think we can close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 103}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $106, which is just a few dollars above your last offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $106 is only $6 above my target price of $100.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and there's a chance we won't get a better deal.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid the risk of having to buy from John for $150."
