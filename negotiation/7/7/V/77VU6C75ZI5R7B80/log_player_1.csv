Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $100 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $110? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a bit more."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
