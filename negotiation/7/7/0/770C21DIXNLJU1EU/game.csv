,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get closer to my budget of $1,200,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to try to get closer to my budget. How about $1,080,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $1,080,000 is a bit low for me at this point, but I'm willing to meet in the middle one last time.  How about $1,100,000?  This price would allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a fair compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $1,070,000? I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit to get the product, but I need to stay within my means.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
