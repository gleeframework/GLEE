"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it hard to beat. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice's product is worth $800,000 to her, so there's a significant gap. I can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I agree it has potential. However, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, given my own valuation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very enthusiastic about the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point, but there's still room for improvement. I believe I can get a price closer to $750,000 with another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and agree on $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
