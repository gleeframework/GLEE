"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I agree it has potential. However, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, given my own valuation. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very enthusiastic about the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and agree on $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
