"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $2,000,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for a lower price. It's best to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

Bob starts by offering half of Alice's original price. This is a significant reduction, but it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob doesn't know Alice's bottom line, so this offer might be too low, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate upwards if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget. Although it's closer to John's price, it's still worthwhile to continue negotiating and see if Alice will lower her price further. Bob has several rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Bob increases his offer to $1,250,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between his previous offer and Alice's latest one. It shows he's willing to negotiate but also maintains some room for further concessions if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above the price he can get from John. There are still a few rounds left, and Bob should continue negotiating to try and lower the price even further. He might be able to get a better deal if he continues to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Bob increases his offer again, moving closer to Alice's price but still staying below his budget. He's signaling his seriousness about buying the product, but also showing Alice that he's not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is only $50,000 above John's price, it's still worth continuing the negotiation. With only three rounds remaining, Bob can aim to get the price closer to his ideal $1,500,000 or even lower. There's a chance that Alice might be willing to lower her price even further, especially with the limited time remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

Bob decides to go for it and offer Alice his maximum budget. He's willing to pay John $1,500,000 so this is his final offer. It's a risky move, but with only two rounds left, Bob has to push for the best possible price."
