{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $690,000 is a good deal for me. It's lower than what I'd pay to John, and I've already negotiated quite a bit. It's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price.  It's time to finalize the deal and secure the product."
