"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $600,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $600,000 is too low for me to consider at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is a fair price considering its value to my business. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $600,000.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $675,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and is closer to your initial offer. Let's try to close this deal.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $685,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value of the product and our previous discussions.",685000.0,Alice,5,
