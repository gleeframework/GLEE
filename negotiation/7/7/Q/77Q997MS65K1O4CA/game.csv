"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $9,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",8800.0,Bob,4,
