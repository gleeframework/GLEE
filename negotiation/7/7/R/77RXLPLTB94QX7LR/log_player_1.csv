Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'll find very useful. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob still gets a good deal at $140, which is less than the product is worth to him. 
* **It avoids being too aggressive:** Asking for $150 right away might make Bob less willing to negotiate.

By starting with this offer, you can see if Bob is interested and then adjust your strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

You can counter Bob's offer with something like:

* **""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about $125?""** 

This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate, but you're not willing to settle for a price that's too far below your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about $125?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product. "", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  It seems like we are getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has offered $120, which is a good compromise. It's a significant increase from his initial offer of $110 and it's closer to your ideal price.  While it's still lower than your previous counteroffer of $125, it's a good deal and worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
