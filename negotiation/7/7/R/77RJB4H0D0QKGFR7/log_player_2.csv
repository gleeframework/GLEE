Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not quite comfortable with $10,750, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I can offer it to you for $11,250. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?

It seems we're at an impasse. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,250, and while I could try another counteroffer, it's getting too close to John's price of $12,000.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting further offers."
