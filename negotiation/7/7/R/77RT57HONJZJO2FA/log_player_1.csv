"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:**  A positive message encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $18,000 is a good starting point, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll either negotiate further with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would be a big loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest and is willing to negotiate. This gives me the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Time to Leverage:**  I have 10 rounds to close the deal, and I'm not yet under pressure to sell to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This price is still a good value for you, and it allows me to  cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering $14,000, which is halfway between my minimum price ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still protecting my interests.
* **Highlight Value:** I remind Bob that $14,000 is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and avoid pushing Bob away.

**Next Steps:**

I'll assess Bob's response and continue negotiating, potentially adjusting my offer depending on his reaction. I'm still open to selling to John, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob if it seems like a better deal is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we both have our limits. How about $11,500? That's a significant step from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob has shown some flexibility, increasing his offer. This suggests there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not yet desperate to sell to John.
* **Time on My Side:** I have several rounds left to reach a more favorable deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, potentially around $13,000. I'll also emphasize the value of the product and highlight the benefits Bob will gain by purchasing it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price reflects the real value of the product, and it would be a good investment for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:**  I'm offering $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise, considering Bob's last offer. This shows I'm taking his offers seriously but still sticking to my principles.
* **Value Emphasized:** I reiterate that $13,000 accurately reflects the value of the product, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and fairness.
* **Seeking Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the need for a solution that benefits both of us, fostering a collaborative approach to the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response.  If he rejects my offer, I'll  need to consider adjusting my approach. If he accepts,  I'll have achieved a good outcome.  If he seems stubborn, I'll be ready to move on to John if the remaining rounds don't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I could go up to $12,000, but that's really pushing my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $12,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** While Bob is showing some progress, the gap between our offers is still significant. I don't want to be forced to accept a price I'm not comfortable with.
* **Time is a Factor:** With only a few rounds left, I need to be strategic and ensure I get the best possible deal. I'm not ready to give up yet.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, potentially around $13,500. I'll explain that this is my final offer, emphasizing the urgency and highlighting the value of the product for Bob. If he refuses, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500, but this is my final offer.  Think about the value you'll get, and let's close this deal. If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency.  This helps pressure Bob into making a decision.
* **Value & Urgency:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the limited time remaining, emphasizing the potential for lost opportunity. 
* **Prepared to Move On:** I explicitly state I'm prepared to sell to John, making it clear I'm not desperate and have other options.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll move on to John to ensure I at least get my minimum price."
