"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This price is still a good value for you, and it allows me to  cover my costs. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we both have our limits. How about $11,500? That's a significant step from my previous offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price reflects the real value of the product, and it would be a good investment for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I could go up to $12,000, but that's really pushing my budget.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're running out of time, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500, but this is my final offer.  Think about the value you'll get, and let's close this deal. If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",13500.0,Alice,7,
