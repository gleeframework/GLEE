"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $140 is less than Alice's value, it's more than your $100 limit and more expensive than buying from John. You can get a better price by rejecting this offer."
