Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product.  I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $9,500. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe your product would be useful, the price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $8,500. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last offer and settle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John. Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and further negotiation risks losing both offers."
