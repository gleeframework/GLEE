"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $25000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $18000. I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  It's a fair price, and hopefully we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
