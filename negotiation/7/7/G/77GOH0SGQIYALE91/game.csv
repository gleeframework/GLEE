"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your perspective on its value, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price of $2,300,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,500,000 to reflect what I believe is a fair valuation based on market standards and my personal assessment of the product's worth.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the returns it can generate. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the immense value this product holds.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
