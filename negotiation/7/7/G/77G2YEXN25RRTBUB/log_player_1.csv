{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's a good starting point:**  It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,000,000), showing flexibility.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's above Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers and a chance to reach a middle ground.
* **It doesn't immediately trigger a 'John' sale:**  I'm not giving away the farm, but I'm also not being overly aggressive, ensuring I can potentially still make a good profit with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is good, but the price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to sell at that price yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a better middle ground."
