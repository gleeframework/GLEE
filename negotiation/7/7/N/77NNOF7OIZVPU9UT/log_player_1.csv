Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps you assess how eager Bob is to acquire the product.  His response will reveal how much he values it and how flexible he might be. 
* **John as Leverage:**  You always have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum price, giving you a strong position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price. You know John will buy it for $1,200,000, so accepting Bob's offer doesn't make sense. It's time to counter and see if you can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,450,000?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're coming down from your initial offer but staying significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to see how much Bob is willing to budge. A large gap between his next offer and yours will indicate you might need to go lower or consider John.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** By staying firm above your minimum, you emphasize the product's value and keep the negotiation power in your hands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price and what John is willing to pay. There's no benefit to further negotiation. Accepting this offer secures you the best possible outcome in this scenario."
