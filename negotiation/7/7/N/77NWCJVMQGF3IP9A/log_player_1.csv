"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $8,500?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $8000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is equal to what I could get from John. Since I'm trying to maximize my earnings, and this is a good price, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell him the product."
