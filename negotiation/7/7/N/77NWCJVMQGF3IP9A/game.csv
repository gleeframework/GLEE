"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7000.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $8500? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $8000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
