"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it's always best to try and negotiate.  Rejecting the first offer gives you a chance to see if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Starting with a lower offer (25% less) demonstrates your desire to negotiate and puts pressure on Alice to compromise.
* **Show Interest:**  Mentioning your interest in the product keeps the negotiation positive and encourages Alice to continue. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  $7,000 is a good starting point for negotiation. You're likely to meet somewhere in the middle if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $8500? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $8,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, you're still within your budget and there's room for further negotiation.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  Rejecting this offer will help gauge how willing Alice is to compromise further.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's a possibility that Alice will come down further to close the deal, especially since you have limited rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $8000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counteroffer:**  Instead of jumping too far, offer a smaller decrease to show you're taking Alice's offer seriously.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  Reiterate that you're trying to find a price that's fair for both parties. This helps keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Maintain Your Budget:**  $8,000 is still within your budget, so you're not taking a significant risk."
