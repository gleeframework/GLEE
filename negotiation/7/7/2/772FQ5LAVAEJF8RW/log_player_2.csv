"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to offer it to you at a special price of $800,000. We believe this is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's a 20% discount, but there's potential to get a better price. 
* **There are more rounds.**  There's no rush to make a decision.  
* **The goal is to save as much money as possible.**  It's worth exploring if a lower price is achievable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a good starting point. However, I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We're willing to meet you halfway. We're willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. We think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility.**  She's moved from $800,000 to $750,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **The price is attractive.**  $750,000 represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. 
* **There are still more rounds.** While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, there's a risk that Alice could walk away from the deal or become less willing to budge.  

It's a good compromise to accept the offer at this point and secure the product at a favorable price."
