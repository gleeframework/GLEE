Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA:** Your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement is selling to John for $800,000. This is your safety net.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This means any price significantly above this will likely be rejected.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000. This gives you a slight advantage. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that is appealing to Bob but also nets you a significant profit. Since you have a guaranteed sale, you can be slightly more aggressive.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You start by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""
* **Justification:**  You frame the price as ""fair"" and tied to the ""significant benefits.""
* **Negotiation Room:** The $75,000 markup provides some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  You can always come down slightly while still remaining above your BATNA. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the offer price."
