"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Alice's value for the product, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, it'll lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $11,500 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm not desperate, so I'll counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $11,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's right in the middle of our last two offers. This shows I'm still negotiating in good faith and am willing to meet her halfway.  It's a strong offer that hopefully gets us to a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $11,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is very close to my counteroffer of $11,000.  While I'd prefer to get it for $11,000,  it's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially having Alice stick to her price or even increase it again.  At this point, it's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
