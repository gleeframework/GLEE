"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $8,750 is simply too low.  I'm prepared to compromise a little more, but I need to get at least $8,900 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle on that and finalize the deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
