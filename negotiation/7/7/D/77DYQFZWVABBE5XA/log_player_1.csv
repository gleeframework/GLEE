Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product's value is even higher.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it seem more reasonable to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I want to maximize profit, I'm setting the price high enough that if Bob rejects it, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
