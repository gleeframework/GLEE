# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16000.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  I need to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $13,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $14500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500.

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  I need to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer again.  The risk of buying from John at $12,000 is still present, but I believe we can get closer to that price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and the value you place on the product, but $14,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500 for this product.

Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. I'll offer the product to you for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high. I'm getting closer to my target price of $12,000, but we're running out of time.  Given the limited rounds and Alice's unwillingness to budge significantly, it's more prudent to secure the product from John at $12,000. This guarantees a purchase at my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not yield a favorable outcome."
