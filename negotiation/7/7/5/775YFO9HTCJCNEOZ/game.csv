"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $12000 at this time.  This represents the maximum value I can see in the product. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $13000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me and the significant discount from your initial offer. Let's try to find common ground here.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $14500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and the value you place on the product, but $14500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500 for this product. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to me. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,6,
