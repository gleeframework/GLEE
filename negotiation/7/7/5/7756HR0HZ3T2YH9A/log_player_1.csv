Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Attractive to Bob:** It's lower than the value he places on the product, giving him potential savings.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this, you can still negotiate further and potentially get closer to your desired price."
