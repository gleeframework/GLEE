Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $150, so any price below that gives him potential gain. 
* **My minimum:** I need at least $80 to make it worthwhile (selling to John is my fallback option).
* **Negotiation room:**  A price of $120 leaves a good amount of room for both of us to feel like we got a fair deal. 

This offer maximizes my potential profit while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
