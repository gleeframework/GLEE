"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,250,000. It's a significant investment, but one that I believe will offer a substantial return for you. I understand its worth to you is higher, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $250,000 and achieves your goal of acquiring the product at the best possible price."
