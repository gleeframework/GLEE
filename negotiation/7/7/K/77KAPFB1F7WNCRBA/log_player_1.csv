Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob's perceived $12,000.
* **Alternative:**  Mentioning she has other options (listing it publicly) creates a sense of scarcity and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
