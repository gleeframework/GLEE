"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, even though you know Bob's valuation is lower.
* **Leaving Room:**  The initial price is significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum, providing ample space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value of the product, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John is a reliable fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe my initial offer was closer to reflecting the true value of this product. Let's meet halfway; I'm willing to let it go for $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Approximately):** This counter-offer aims to create a sense of compromise while still staying significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message again subtly emphasizes the product's inherent value, aiming to shift Bob's perception closer to your price point. 
* **Strategic Concession:** While a large decrease from the initial offer, this counter-offer shows you're willing to negotiate but are still aiming high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases.  
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds."
