This is the best choice for the following reasons:

* **Alice has reached her minimum price:** She's clearly stated she won't go lower than $80.
* **You're getting a good deal:** $80 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $100 and John's offer of $100. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:**  Continuing to haggle risks alienating Alice and might not result in a better price."
