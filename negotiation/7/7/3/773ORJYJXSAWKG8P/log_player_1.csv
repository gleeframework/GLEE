"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price of $80, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will find this price attractive, given the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get closer to my ideal price by continuing the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, and I believe it's likely to be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my original asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and $90 is a good price for me.  It's more than I would get from John, and it's a reasonable compromise given Bob's counteroffers.  I'd rather close the deal now than risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer."
