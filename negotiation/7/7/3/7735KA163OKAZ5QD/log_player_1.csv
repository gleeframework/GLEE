{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum price of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me at this point, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to reach my minimum price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $8250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is my minimum price, so I'm going to accept it and sell the product to him. It's a good deal for both of us."
