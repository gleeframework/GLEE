"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $600,000?"", 
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give ourselves room for negotiation. 
* **Aiming High:** Our goal is to get the product as close to $600,000 as possible, but we're prepared to go higher if necessary.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer allows for several rounds of back-and-forth without immediately hitting our $800,000 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects the value we're both looking for.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still High:** While Alice came down significantly, $850,000 is still above our ideal price and our fallback option (John at $800,000).
* **Room to Negotiate:**  We have several rounds left, and Alice's message suggests she's open to further negotiation. 

Let's see if we can get Alice closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still very interested, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $720,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 720000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but not by a huge amount. This shows Alice we're serious but still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** We're aiming for a price roughly halfway between our last offer ($600,000) and her current offer ($850,000).  
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  We're still below our $800,000 fallback option, reminding Alice (subtly) that we have other alternatives."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $720,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $780,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $780,000 is a very good price and only slightly above our John fallback of $800,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away, or we might only gain a small amount. It's not worth risking the deal for $20,000.
* **Fair Deal:** Alice has also made significant compromises. Accepting this offer demonstrates good faith and allows both parties to feel good about the outcome."
