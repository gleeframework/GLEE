"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John at $150."
