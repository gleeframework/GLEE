Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to explore if he's willing to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at high demand (""interest I've had"") to justify the high price, even though I haven't listed it publicly yet.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $12,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still potentially securing a price higher than $10,000.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
