Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $500,000 undervalues the true capabilities and potential of this product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the value of this product. It's clear you recognize its potential.  To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I'd prefer to work with you. My final offer is $1,400,000.  This is a considerable compromise and my absolute limit.

}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but she's still far above your maximum budget of $800,000. Her mentioning another buyer might be a negotiation tactic, and even if it's true, it's not worth exceeding your limit. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
