"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to try and save as much money as possible, and $90 is still a decent amount. By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point given my maximum budget of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it.  I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get Alice to come down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $80. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still trying to get the best possible price. It's a compromise, and hopefully, Alice will accept it."
