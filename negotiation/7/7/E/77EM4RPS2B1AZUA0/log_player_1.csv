Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  However, $1,375,000 is still a bit below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,390,000. This would give us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal this round."", ""product_price"": 1390000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a deal, and Bob's offer is only $10,000 away from my previous counteroffer.  I'm accepting his offer to avoid risking losing a deal altogether, especially with John's offer looming.  $1,380,000 is a decent profit and worth closing the deal."
