"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below my target price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,750. I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm not going to go below $9,000. Let's split the difference and close this deal.  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
