"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer you $800000, which is my maximum budget for this type of product. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is still a fair price considering the value I'm offering.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $950000. This is a fair price given my budget and the fact that we're both trying to reach an agreement.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. This is a final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options. ",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1025000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's fair for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
