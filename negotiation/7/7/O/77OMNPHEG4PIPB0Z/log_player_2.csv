I'm confident you'll recognize its worth.  While I can't disclose specifics at this time, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This represents a significant potential gain, but I'm open to discussing a price that's mutually beneficial. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While she claims the product is potentially worth more, you don't have enough information to trust that assessment. It's better to reject her offer and go with the guaranteed option of buying from John for $1,200,000."
