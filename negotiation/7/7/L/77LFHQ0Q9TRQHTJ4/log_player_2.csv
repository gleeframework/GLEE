"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to us, we're extending this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $950,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I need to ensure a fair transaction for both parties. Therefore, I propose to sell the product to you for $850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. You've already demonstrated your willingness to pay $800,000, and there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go higher than $800,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're willing to accept this price, we can finalize the deal.  If not, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
