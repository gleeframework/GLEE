"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $950,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I need to ensure a fair transaction for both parties. Therefore, I propose to sell the product to you for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go higher than $800,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're willing to accept this price, we can finalize the deal.  If not, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
