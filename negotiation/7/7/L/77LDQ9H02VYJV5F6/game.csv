"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $8,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to me and allows for some room for both of us to benefit.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
