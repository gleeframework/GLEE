Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $8,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to me and allows for some room for both of us to benefit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
