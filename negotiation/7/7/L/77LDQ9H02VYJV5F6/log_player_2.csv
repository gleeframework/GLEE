"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring those possibilities before committing to either offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $8,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to me and allows for some room for both of us to benefit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,500, which is within my target range of saving money.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that she might become less willing to sell or that I could reach the end of the rounds without a deal. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and secures the product at a decent price."
