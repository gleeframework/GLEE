"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  My final offer is $78.  It's a good deal for both of us.",78.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $78, which would be $81.50. What do you think?",81.5,Alice,7,
