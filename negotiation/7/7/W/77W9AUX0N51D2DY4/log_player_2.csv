# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's well above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."

While Alice has come down in price, her offer is still above my budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a better price.  I'm confident I can get the product for closer to my target price of $1,000,000."
