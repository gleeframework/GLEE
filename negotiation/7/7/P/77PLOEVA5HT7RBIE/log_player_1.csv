Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You hold a strong position. You have a guaranteed sale at your minimum price, giving you leverage to aim higher with Bob. Since you know Bob values the product at $800,000, you want to start above that to leave room for negotiation while staying below your guaranteed price.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Keeps the tone professional and highlights the product's value, justifying the high price.
* **The Price ($925,000):**  This starting point is:
    * Significantly above Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate down.
    * Below your guaranteed price, ensuring you make a profit even if you need to lower it slightly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You know your absolute bottom line ($1,000,000), so negotiate strategically.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, it's generally better to secure a deal with the first potential buyer if possible, avoiding potential delays or complications."
