Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm aiming for a good starting point, and we can negotiate from there.  I'll be ready to counter any offers Bob makes, but I'm also aware I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a good price, but I'm also willing to be flexible and compromise. We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a little more, $14,200 is a good price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for less."
