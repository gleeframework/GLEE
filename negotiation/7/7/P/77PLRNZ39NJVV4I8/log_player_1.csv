Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a strong initial offer. This anchors the negotiation higher and gives you room to maneuver downwards. 
* **Significantly Above Both Valuations:** While Bob values the product at $1,000,000, and your minimum is $1,200,000, starting significantly above both figures allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a deal much closer to your ideal price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, you signal a willingness to negotiate and give Bob the impression of getting a ""deal"" if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Backup Option (John):**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a strong safety net.  You're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while maintaining a collaborative tone with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial price of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering its value. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value of the product but still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000, so accepting Bob's offer would be leaving money on the table. It's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the value of this product is substantial, and I need to be realistic about its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** We're coming down from the initial high offer, showing Bob we are open to negotiation. 
* **Still Above Both Valuations:** The counteroffer remains above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, leaving room for further negotiation but in a way that protects your interests.
* **Targeting a Win-Win:** Aiming for a price near the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's offer suggests a fair compromise that could lead to a mutually agreeable deal. 
* **John as Leverage:** The presence of John's guaranteed offer gives you the confidence to stand firm at a price that meets your needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. To make a deal happen, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while staying within my budget.  Let's find common ground here and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's guaranteed offer. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, it's unlikely Bob will go much higher. Accepting this offer secures the sale at your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal altogether."
