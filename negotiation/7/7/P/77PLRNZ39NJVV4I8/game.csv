"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial price of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering its value. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the value of this product is substantial, and I need to be realistic about its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. To make a deal happen, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while staying within my budget.  Let's find common ground here and close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
