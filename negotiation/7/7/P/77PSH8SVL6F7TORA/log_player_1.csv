Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is a fair price. I'd like to make a new offer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

**Reasoning:** Bob is now significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's unlikely he'll come up high enough to make further negotiation worthwhile. We have a guaranteed sale with John at our minimum, so it's time to cut our losses with Bob."
