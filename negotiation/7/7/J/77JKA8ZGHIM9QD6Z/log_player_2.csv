Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good compromise, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $11,000.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, making it the best financial decision."
