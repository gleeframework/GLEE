"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $10,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good compromise, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
