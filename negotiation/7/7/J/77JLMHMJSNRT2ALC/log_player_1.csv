Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $100 gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

By starting the negotiation at $140, you maximize your chances of securing a price closer to Bob's perceived value while staying above your minimum."
