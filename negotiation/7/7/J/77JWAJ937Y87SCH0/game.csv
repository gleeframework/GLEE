"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? ",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $9,000 for the product. It's still a great deal, considering the value it can bring to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,000. Would that be feasible?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm proposing a price of $8,200 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",8200.0,Alice,5,
