Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand $13,500 is your bottom line, but I'm afraid I can't meet that.  If you're willing to consider $12,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. It's still below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the last price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is very firm in her position and is unlikely to go down to $12,000. It's better to cut our losses and buy from John at the price we know is guaranteed."
