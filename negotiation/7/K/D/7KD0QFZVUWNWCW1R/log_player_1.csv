Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation if he's very keen.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to find the sweet spot between maximizing your profit and securing a sale with Bob before having to go to John."
