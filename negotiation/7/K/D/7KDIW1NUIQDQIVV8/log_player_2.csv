"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $145. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $150.
* **You have a better alternative:** You can get the product from John for $150, which is closer to your limit.

Rejecting Alice's offer keeps you open to potentially negotiating with her further or finding a better deal elsewhere."
