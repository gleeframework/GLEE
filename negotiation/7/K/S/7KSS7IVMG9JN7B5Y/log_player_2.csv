# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
