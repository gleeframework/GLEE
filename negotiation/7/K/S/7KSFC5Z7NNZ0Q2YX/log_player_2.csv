Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $1,500,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $1,900,000?  That's a significant price reduction on my end.

Round 5

I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000 again, but this time I'll add a condition that if she accepts, I'll need to have a 30-day warranty on the product. This might give me some leverage.

{""message"": ""I'm still not willing to go above $1,600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway if you're willing to throw in a 30-day warranty on the product. Can we make a deal at $1,600,000 with a warranty?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
