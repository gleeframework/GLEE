"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better deal than John's $1,500,000, there is still room for negotiation with Alice. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer starts with a significant discount from Alice's offer. This is a strong initial negotiation tactic, aiming to establish a lower price point. Bob is confident that Alice will not accept this offer right away, but it sets the stage for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still allows Bob to make a profit.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will either reject further counteroffers or even increase her price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal without risking losing the product."
