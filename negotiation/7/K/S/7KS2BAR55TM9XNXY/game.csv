"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12000. I'm willing to come down to $13500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your life!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $13500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13500, which would be $12750. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12750 and $13500, which would be $13125. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. Let me know if this is acceptable to you!",13125.0,Alice,5,
