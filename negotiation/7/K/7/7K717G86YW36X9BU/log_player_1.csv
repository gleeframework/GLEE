Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below what I could get from John. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above what Bob offered. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is better than what he offered previously, and although it's lower than what I would prefer, it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to accept this offer and sell to Bob."
