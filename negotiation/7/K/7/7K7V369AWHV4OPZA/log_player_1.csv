Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim high with Bob. Starting at $19,000 allows for potential negotiation downward while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A high initial offer gives Bob the impression that the price is flexible and open to discussion. This can lead to a mutually agreeable price above your minimum. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A strong initial offer can also help you understand how interested Bob is in the product. His reaction will give you valuable information for any subsequent negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Value:** While this scenario focuses on individual valuations, in a real-world situation, researching the general market value of your product is crucial. 
* **Relationship Building:** While maximizing profit is important, consider the long-term implications. A more aggressive initial offer might alienate Bob, while a fairer approach could foster a positive relationship for future transactions."
