"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm aiming to get a price as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but I need to allow space for Bob to negotiate and come to a mutually agreeable number.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I want to maximize my profit by trying to get closer to Bob's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1050000.  I believe this price reflects a fair value considering your asking price and my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is a starting point, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I cannot accept this offer without losing money.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to push for a higher price.  
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  I still have 8 rounds left. I'm confident I can reach a more profitable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Reasonable Reduction:**  I'm lowering my price by $50,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a Profit Margin:**  This counteroffer still allows me to earn a significant profit, which is my primary goal.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Going:**  I want to keep the conversation going and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1075000. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe there's still potential to get a higher price.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to settle for John's offer. I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000, which is a good compromise.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we keep working together."", ""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Small Reduction:** I'm lowering my price by $10,000, showing I'm flexible but still holding firm.
* **Maintaining a Profit Margin:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Creating Pressure:** I'm making a small concession, but also emphasizing the need to find common ground, potentially prompting Bob to make a more significant move in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about we meet in the middle at $1080000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us finalize this deal.  Let's close it!

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is a good compromise, and it's a fair price for both of us. 
* **Finalizing the Deal:**  We've been negotiating for several rounds, and it's time to close the deal.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While I could try for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids that risk."
