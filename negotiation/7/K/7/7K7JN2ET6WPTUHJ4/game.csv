"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1050000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1075000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1090000, which is a good compromise.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we keep working together.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
