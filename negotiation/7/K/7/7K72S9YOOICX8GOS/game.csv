"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,750,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've considered your latest offer, and while I understand the value of your product, I still feel that $1,600,000 is out of my price range. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
