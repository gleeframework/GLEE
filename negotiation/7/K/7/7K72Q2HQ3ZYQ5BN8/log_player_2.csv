"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. I know the product is worth even more to you, and this price reflects its true value.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer willing to pay $1,200,000.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer. However, her offer of $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than what she values the product at ($1,200,000).
* You have a better alternative: John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. While this is higher than Alice's offer, you're aiming to save as much as possible. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with purchasing from John if necessary."
