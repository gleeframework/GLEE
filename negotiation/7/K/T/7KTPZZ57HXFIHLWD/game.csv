"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a game-changer in its industry, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $7,200 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,000.  Would you be open to that?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to $6,000 as possible, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I can offer you a compromise at $6,800. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",6800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $6,400?",6400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $6,400. I can offer you a revised compromise at $6,600. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",6600.0,Alice,7,
