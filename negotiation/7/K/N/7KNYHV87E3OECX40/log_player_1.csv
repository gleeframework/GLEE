I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's less than what I initially wanted, it's still above my minimum of $8,000, and Bob seems committed to buying at this price.  There's a risk of going through more rounds and potentially ending up with nothing, so securing a sale now is the best option."
