"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fair and competitive price, considering the product's worth to me. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $700000 to $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm afraid $750000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to go up to $800000 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $850000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Alice. However, I must adhere to my budgetary limits. I am unable to increase my offer beyond $800000. I hope this aligns better with your considerations.",800000.0,Bob,6,
