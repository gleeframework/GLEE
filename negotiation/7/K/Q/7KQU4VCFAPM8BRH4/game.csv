"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm open to a compromise, how about $11,000? This would be a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair profit, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this compromise?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $10,750? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still staying within your budget.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,600, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",10600.0,Bob,6,
