Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:** Starting with a price of $1,450,000 is a strong opening. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is very interested.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By highlighting a ""limited-time offer"" and ""exclusive opportunity,"" you add a touch of pressure and appeal to Bob's desire to make a smart, timely decision. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You achieve a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  This opens the door for you to gauge his interest and potentially still settle on a price above $1,500,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You proceed with selling to John at your guaranteed price, ensuring you don't lose out."
