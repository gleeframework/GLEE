"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $120 to Alice, so she's already giving me a discount, but it's still $19 more than I'm willing to pay. I'll see if I can get a better deal from John.
