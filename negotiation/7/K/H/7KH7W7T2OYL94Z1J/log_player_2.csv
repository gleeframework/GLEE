"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price of $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down further, and Bob has the backup option of buying from John for $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 target. While $9,500 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial price, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has a strong fallback option with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend right now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently tried to negotiate a lower price, and Alice has shown a willingness to meet him halfway. However, $9,250 is still too high for Bob, who is aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to go with John's offer and secure the product for his target price.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's also the risk that the negotiations will stall, and Bob could end up paying even more than $9,250.  By buying from John, Bob ensures a guaranteed deal at his desired price."
