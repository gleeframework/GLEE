"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  

**Strategy:**

* **High Opening:**  This sets the initial bargaining position and forces Bob to make the first concession if he wants to make a deal.
* **Leave Room:**  I'm not aiming for a final price of $1,500,000, but I'm hoping to find a middle ground.
* **The ""John"" Factor:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 backup option gives me confidence to push for a higher price and walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's not worth accepting at this point. 

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and Counter:** I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This shows I'm serious about getting a fair price and am willing to continue negotiating.
* **The ""John"" Factor:**  Since I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, I have the luxury of taking my time and waiting for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with a price of $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and move closer to Bob's offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing I'm ready to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation, as I don't want to close the deal too quickly and potentially miss out on a higher price.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** Knowing I can walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me confidence to push for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's closer, I'm not willing to accept it yet.

**Strategy:**

* **Stay Firm:**  I'm sticking to my minimum price. I'm aware that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob.
* **Counter Again:** I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** This is a reminder that I have a solid backup plan, allowing me to continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with a price of $1,150,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get close to my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway. This increases the likelihood of a deal.
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm now closer to Bob's offer, indicating that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **The ""John"" Factor:**  I'm still relying on the backup option of selling to John, giving me confidence to hold out for a price that's closer to my minimum."
