Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, starting high leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Urgency and Competition:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Goal:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit by:

1. **Ideal Scenario:** Bob accepts the $1,300,000 offer, netting you a significant gain.
2. **Negotiation:** If Bob counters, there's room to negotiate downwards while staying above your $1,500,000 safety net (John's offer). 
3. **Backup:** If Bob rejects the offer outright, you can proceed with John's guaranteed purchase."
