"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $750,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential benefits it offers.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $650,000. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $725,000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend at this time. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $650,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach a deal at that price.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $650,000, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering $700,000, which is closer to your original offer, but still reflects the product's true value. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a deal that works for both of us.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $700,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a little hesitant.  To make this work for me, I'd need to come in at $675,000. It's a small difference, but it's crucial for me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement at this price.",675000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $675,000. I've already come down significantly from my initial offer, and I think this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm offering $690,000, which is a compromise between our positions. I hope we can find a deal at this price.",690000.0,Alice,7,
