"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1050000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1050000 is closer to my initial offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $900000. How about we meet in the middle at $975000? This would be a significant saving for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to think about my minimum price. I'm willing to go to $1050000, but I'll meet you halfway between that and $975000. Let's try $1012500. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1012500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $990000, which is closer to our previous meeting point. This would be a significant savings for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $990000. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum price, and I'm willing to make a final push to meet in the middle. I'll meet you at $1010000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price. What do you think?",1010000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your desire to finalize the deal. I've also been flexible throughout this negotiation.  However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $990000. Let's meet in the middle at $1000000. This would be a significant savings for both of us and allow us to close this deal in a timely manner.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've been flexible and made several compromises, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1000000, and I'm starting to think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but I'm not going to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What's your final decision?",1000000.0,Alice,9,
