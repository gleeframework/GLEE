"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $145. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it!",145.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested, but $145 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $135.  I'm still a little hesitant at that price.  How about we try $136?  It's a small compromise on both our ends, and we can finalize this.",136.0,Alice,5,
