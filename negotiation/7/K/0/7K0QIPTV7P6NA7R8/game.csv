"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price around $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $700,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This would still offer you a substantial benefit while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on my investment. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but I really need to stay within my limits. Can you meet me at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
