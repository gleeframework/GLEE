"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,000 is closer, but still a little high for me. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is still a good price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",8500.0,Alice,5,
