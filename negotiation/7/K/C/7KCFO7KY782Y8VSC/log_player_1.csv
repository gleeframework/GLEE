"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm aiming to maximize my earnings and see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a loss. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still ensures a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for a loss.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, while still securing a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I get at least my minimum value."
