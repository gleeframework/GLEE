# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13000 for it. Can you consider $13000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $13000, which is $12250. Can you consider that?

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget of $12,000. While it's close, I'm not comfortable risking another round and potentially going over my budget. John's offer is within my budget and guarantees I won't overspend."
