"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $600,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $750,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $675,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $675,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
