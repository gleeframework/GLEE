"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price. I still have several rounds to work with, so there's no need to rush into a deal that isn't favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,100,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is my best and final offer for now. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but it's still above what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. I've still got a few rounds left and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 is still not enough to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,280,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,280,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay.  With only three rounds left, it's unlikely I can negotiate further and reach a price that's acceptable to both of us.  Since John is offering the product at my maximum budget of $1,500,000, it makes sense to buy from him.  While I won't be saving any money, it's better to secure the product than to continue negotiating and risk losing out entirely."
