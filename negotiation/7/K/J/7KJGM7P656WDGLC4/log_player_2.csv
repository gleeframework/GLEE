"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is the full price, leaving no room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive start:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price.  It shows Bob is serious about saving money.
* **Clear message:** The message explains Bob's reasoning and positions him as a willing buyer, but at a lower price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for Alice to make concessions, allowing for a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product has tremendous value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you at $1,100,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer. Accepting the offer at $1,100,000 saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, there's no guarantee, and the risk of losing the deal entirely increases with each round.  

At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical decision to secure the product while still achieving a significant saving."
