"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product has tremendous value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.
