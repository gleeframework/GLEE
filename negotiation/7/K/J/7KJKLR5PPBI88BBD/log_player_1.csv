{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives Bob room to negotiate and makes him more likely to accept the offer.
* **Message:** I'm trying to build rapport with Bob by highlighting the product's potential value to him. 

**Strategy:**

* I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer.
* I also have the option to sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob break down, so I'm not pressured to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, perhaps $110, and see if he's willing to compromise.  I'll also keep the option to sell to John for $150 in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $105, which is halfway between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $90. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while maintaining my position. I'm also trying to appeal to his sense of fairness by suggesting a compromise. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.
* By presenting a counteroffer that's a reasonable compromise, I'm hoping to make Bob more likely to accept.
* I'm still keeping the option of selling to John for $150 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum price of $150 than Bob's previous offers, it's still not enough for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $150. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my desired price, perhaps $100.  If he rejects that offer, I might be more inclined to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference again, how about $100? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's the best we can do. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $100, which is halfway between my previous offer of $105 and Bob's offer of $95. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my willingness to compromise and highlighting the fairness of the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a price that's both acceptable to me and within Bob's budget.
* By offering a compromise and emphasizing the fairness of the deal, I hope to increase Bob's chances of accepting.
* I'm still aware that I have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I really want this product. How about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is still too low for me. While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I've reached a point where I'm  not confident we'll be able to agree on a price that's acceptable to both of us.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $150, I'm going to cut my losses and sell to him. It's a much better deal for me than accepting Bob's offer."
