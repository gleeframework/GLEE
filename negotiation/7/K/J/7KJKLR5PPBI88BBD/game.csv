,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $105 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $95?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference again, how about $100? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's the best we can do. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
