# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product at a price of $16,000. I believe it will greatly benefit you, and this is a very competitive offer considering its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $16,000."
