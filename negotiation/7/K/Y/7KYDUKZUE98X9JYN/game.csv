"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects a substantial discount while still allowing me to reach my minimum target. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel we might be able to find a better balance. Could you consider bringing the price down to $1,250,000? I believe this would be more aligned with my budget while still allowing me to secure the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This price would allow me to make a fair profit while still being very competitive for you. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your proposal. I understand the need for a fair profit, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Would it be possible to further reduce the price to $1,225,000? This would be closer to what I am prepared to pay, while still allowing you to achieve a reasonable profit.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm trying to be as accommodating as possible, but $1,225,000 is still just a bit below where I need to be. Let's compromise at $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, I am still unable to agree to $1,250,000. Could you consider reducing the price to $1,200,000? This would be more aligned with my budget and still provide a reasonable profit for you.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
