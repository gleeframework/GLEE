"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

You can definitely do better than $950,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is still well above what the product is worth to Alice, but it's a significant step down from her initial offer. Hopefully, she'll accept it, but if not, you can continue to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a lot closer to what Alice values the product at, it's still more than you want to pay.  You can likely get a better price if you continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise, closer to Alice's offer but still under $1 million. This shows you are willing to negotiate but also have a limit. Hopefully, Alice sees the value in a quick sale at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is being stubborn, and the price is creeping closer to what John is offering.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
