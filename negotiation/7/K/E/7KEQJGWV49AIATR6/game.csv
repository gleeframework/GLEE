"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, though.  How about $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's a price I can live with.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
