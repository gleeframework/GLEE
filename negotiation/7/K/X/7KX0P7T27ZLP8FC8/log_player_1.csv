Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified without directly stating it's worth more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to discussing the price further, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of John's offer ($10,000). This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale if needed."
