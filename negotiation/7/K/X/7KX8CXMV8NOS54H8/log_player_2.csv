"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise between its worth to me and its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's**, but you can still do better.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer** gives you the opportunity to negotiate further with her or potentially find another seller with a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is the worst option** since it's the most expensive."
