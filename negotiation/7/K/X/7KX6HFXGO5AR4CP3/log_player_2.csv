"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get an even better deal from Alice.  It's also a good tactic to show Alice that you're serious about getting a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It demonstrates my intent to negotiate and potentially save a significant amount of money. It's aggressive, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This is a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  While there's always a chance Alice could come down further, it's becoming riskier to keep negotiating. The potential savings are shrinking, and I don't want to risk losing a good deal by being too greedy."
