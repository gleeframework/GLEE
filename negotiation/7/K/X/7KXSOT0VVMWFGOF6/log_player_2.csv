"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely starting high. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and might be able to get the product for closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
