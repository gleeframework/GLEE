# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which I believe will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to inflate the perceived value, her offer of $1,300,000 is still $200,000 less than your maximum price and significantly less than John's offer of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves you money and achieves your goal of acquiring the product."
