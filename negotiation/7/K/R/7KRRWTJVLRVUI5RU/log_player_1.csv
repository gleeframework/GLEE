"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still within a reasonable range.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The $17,000 price allows for some wiggle room in case Bob wants to counteroffer.
* **Showing willingness:** My message indicates a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to stay engaged. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  This price is still higher than John's offer, so I'm not losing out by negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not going to give in to his first counteroffer.
* **Keeping John as an option:** I'm not in a desperate position to sell. John's offer of $15,000 is still on the table, so I have leverage in the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  Let's split the difference and make this deal work. "", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer ($17,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Staying above minimum:**  This price is still higher than John's offer, ensuring I don't lose out by negotiating with Bob.
* **Positive messaging:**  The message emphasizes a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. He's clearly interested and has shown willingness to compromise.
* **Keeping John as a safety net:**  I'm not in a desperate position to sell.  John's offer of $15,000 is still available if I can't reach a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible here. How about $13,750? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm offering a price halfway between my last offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,500). This shows continued commitment to compromise.
* **Close to minimum:** This offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), but I'm willing to take a slight loss for a quick sale.
* **Urgency and finality:**  The message suggests a final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision and closing the deal.
* **Positive messaging:**  The message remains positive, encouraging a successful negotiation and sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too low:** Bob's offer of $13,250 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  With only four rounds remaining, there's not enough time to negotiate further and potentially get a better offer.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

Given the limited time and Bob's persistent low offers, it's in my best interest to secure the guaranteed profit with John."
