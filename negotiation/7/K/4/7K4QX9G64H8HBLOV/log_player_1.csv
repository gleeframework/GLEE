"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, I'm not willing to sell to John for $120 just yet. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $125. This is still above my minimum and closer to Bob's initial offer, making it a more appealing option for him while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm not ready to accept $115 and selling to John at $120 is still my last resort. I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price to my minimum of $120. This is a fair price for both of us and I hope Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'll be forced to sell to John for the same price, so there's no further incentive for me to continue negotiating."
