"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair for both of us. I'm asking for $1000000. Please consider this offer carefully, as it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
