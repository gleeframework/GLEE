Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above your minimum ($150).
* **Negotiating Room:**  Offering $145 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum.

**Why this strategy is better than offering $150 directly:**

* It might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal, increasing the chance of a sale.
* It opens the door for negotiation, potentially landing you a higher price than John's offer."
