Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows me to potentially gain more than the guaranteed $100 from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The higher price leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle at a price still higher than my minimum.
* **Psychological Anchor:** By presenting a higher number initially, I might influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

**Important Note:** There's a risk that Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since I have a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, it's a calculated risk worth taking to potentially earn more."
