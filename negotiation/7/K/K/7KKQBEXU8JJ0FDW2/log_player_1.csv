"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high offer, as it's worth $800,000 to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate if needed.  However, it's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than I'm willing to accept right now, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll likely try to meet him halfway, but I'm keeping the option to sell to John open if things don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $750,000 is a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825,000? This price still leaves some room for profit for me, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. Let's try $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly what I would get from John.  Since we're already at my minimum price, there's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
