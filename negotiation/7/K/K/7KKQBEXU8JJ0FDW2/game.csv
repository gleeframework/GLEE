"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $750,000 is a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825,000? This price still leaves some room for profit for me, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. Let's try $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
