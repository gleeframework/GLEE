"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John would guarantee me $1,200,000, but I'm hopeful I can secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to be flexible,  $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This represents a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and  represents a significant improvement from his previous offers. While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of him, I'm not sure if it's worth the risk. Accepting his offer now ensures a deal and a good profit."
