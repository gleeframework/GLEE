Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your asking price and the value I see in it.  Let me know if you're open to this.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $8,500 is too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.
