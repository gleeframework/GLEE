"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer you $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $135. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back down to $130. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $132. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",132.0,Alice,5,
