Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for $1,450,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the potential return you could see from it."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows its worth much more to her. Starting with a high offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **Near Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John. This eliminates the risk of a low offer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value (""unique value proposition"", ""potential return"") to justify the high price without revealing specific details. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit by:

1. **Potentially securing a sale above John's offer:** If Bob accepts, Alice gets a better deal.
2. **Setting the stage for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, Alice has room to lower the price slightly and still secure a profit above $1,500,000."
