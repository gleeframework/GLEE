Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll offer it to him for $1,200,000. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is higher than my initial offer, but lower than the product's value to him, I'll consider it. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000, which is still below its value to me. I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $1,150,000, which is closer to the product's value to Bob. Here's my response:
