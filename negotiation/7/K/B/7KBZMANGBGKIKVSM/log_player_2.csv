# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budgetary considerations and am pleased to offer a more flexible pricing option. In light of this, I propose a revised price of $925,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount from its true value of $1,000,000 to you, while allowing us to meet somewhere closer to your budget. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. Should you have any further inquiries or wish to proceed with this offer, please let me know.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is within your budget and a good deal considering the product's value to you.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially raising the price again, or you simply running out of time and having to buy from John for a higher price, makes accepting this offer the best choice."
