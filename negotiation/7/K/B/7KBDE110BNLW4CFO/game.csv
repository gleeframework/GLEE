,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll come down to $15000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's a fair compromise given your offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
