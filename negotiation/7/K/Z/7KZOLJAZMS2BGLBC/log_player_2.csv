"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a significant discount compared to its market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's but still leaves room for negotiation.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is selling for $950,000. This means there's a potential for a price that works for both of you.
* **Negotiation is the best strategy to try to save money.** Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still higher than Alice's bottom line of $800,000. This shows you're serious about getting a good deal but are also willing to compromise.
* **Justifies the offer:**  The message highlights the value of the product and emphasizes the fairness of the proposed price. 
* **Sets the stage for further negotiation:**  This counteroffer is likely to be rejected, but it provides a starting point for further negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between the value we both see in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is significantly better than John's price.** You can get the product for $900,000 from Alice, which is $300,000 less than what John is offering.
* **The negotiation is moving in your favor.** Alice has already come down from her initial offer, and you're likely to save even more money if you continue negotiating. However, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to negotiate further.
* **Taking the deal minimizes risk.**  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a good price and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down or Alice walking away.

**Next Steps:** You've successfully negotiated a lower price with Alice. You can now purchase the product at $900,000."
