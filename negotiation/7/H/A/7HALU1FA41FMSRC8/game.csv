"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can secure it at a lower price elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you!",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price still gives you a good value and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're able to communicate effectively. While $11,500 is closer to my budget, I still feel that we might be able to find common ground. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
