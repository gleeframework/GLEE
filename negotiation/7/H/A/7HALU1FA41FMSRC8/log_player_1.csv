{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're willing to negotiate, but you're not giving it away for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can secure it at a lower price elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price still gives you a good value and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're able to communicate effectively. While $11,500 is closer to my budget, I still feel that we might be able to find common ground. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum value and a reasonable compromise. It's still a better deal than selling to John for $15,000. I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
