"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my potential earnings. $2,000,000 is a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will likely counteroffer, giving me an opportunity to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. By rejecting this offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to push for a price closer to my initial offer.  There's still a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, especially if he values the product more than he's currently indicating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating. $1,900,000 is still a significant amount above my minimum price, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise that might lead to a deal in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Although $1,700,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have several rounds left and I want to maximize my profits. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm hoping to reach a price closer to $1,800,000 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly to $1,850,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, increasing the chances of a deal in the next round. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I still have several rounds left and I'm hesitant to settle so low. I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially as we're getting close to the end of the negotiations. There's a chance Bob might raise his offer again, especially if he truly wants the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer again, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  With only a few rounds left, I need to be more aggressive in finding a middle ground. This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest one, and I believe it is a fair and realistic price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price, with only two rounds remaining, it's risky to keep rejecting.  I might not be able to secure a higher price, and there's a chance Bob might walk away.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
