Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better price than John's offer. This opening price reflects the product's value to Bob, while also giving me a good starting point."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
