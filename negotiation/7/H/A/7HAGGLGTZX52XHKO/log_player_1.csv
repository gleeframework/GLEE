Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This price is significantly higher than your fallback offer from John ($12,000), ensuring you get a good deal even if Bob negotiates down slightly."
