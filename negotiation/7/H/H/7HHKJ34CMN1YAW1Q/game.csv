"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is simply out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite low.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my final offer, as I can always buy the product from John for $12,000.",14000.0,Bob,4,
