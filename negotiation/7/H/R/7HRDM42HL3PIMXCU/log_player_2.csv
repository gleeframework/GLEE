"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $900,000 is less than your max budget, it's still significantly higher than what Alice likely needs to get for the product. There's room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. How about we meet in the middle at $825000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's counteroffer is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. There's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $825,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $737,500? I think that's a fair compromise, and it lets us both get what we need out of this deal."", ""product_price"": 737500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $737500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $737500 and $825000, which is $781250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $781,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $781,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I'd love to push for a lower price, Alice is clearly willing to compromise.  $781,250 is a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity. Accepting here allows me to secure the product within my budget while still getting a decent price."
