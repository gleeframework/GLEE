{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! I'm confident you'll find its value substantial."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer sets a high starting point, leaving room for negotiation.  I believe it's a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:** This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **It shows confidence:** A high initial offer implies I believe in the product's value, which could make Bob more willing to engage.

However, I'm prepared to potentially lower the price if necessary. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If negotiations stall, I'll always have the option of selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for $950,000 to make this deal work for me.  Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm countering with $950,000 for the following reasons:

* **It's a compromise:** It's a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:** I'm keeping my minimum sale price in mind and leaving room for potential further negotiations.
* **It's a strong signal:** I'm confident in the product's value and believe this price reflects its worth.

This counteroffer allows for continued dialogue while keeping my financial goals in sight. I'll evaluate Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly, while always keeping the option of selling to John for $800,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925000. Can we meet in the middle at $912500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $912,500 is a strong offer and significantly higher than selling to John. It's a good compromise and a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price."
