"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer and recognizing the product's value. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still significantly below what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
