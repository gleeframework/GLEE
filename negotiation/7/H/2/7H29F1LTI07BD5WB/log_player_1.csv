I'm starting with a high price of $1,750,000.  This leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that Bob will counter-offer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to achieve. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,600,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still well above my minimum. I believe this is a fair compromise that might entice Bob to accept while still ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me, as I can make a profit while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal. I will accept Bob's offer."
