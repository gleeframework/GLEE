"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good price quickly. I'm confident that Bob will find the offer attractive, but if he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I believe this counteroffer is fair and will entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price of $8,000, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a lower price or even a rejection, forcing me to sell to John.  Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and saves time."
