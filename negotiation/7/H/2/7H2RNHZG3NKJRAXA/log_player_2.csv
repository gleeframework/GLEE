Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. This price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $8500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9000, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8800, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is my final concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is only $300 above Bob's ideal price of $8,500. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or raise her price again.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal or having to pay more to John."
