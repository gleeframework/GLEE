"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my target price by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,075,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to secure a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low. How about we settle on $1,090,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1090000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,090,000. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's getting closer to the end of the negotiations. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,080,000 is a good outcome,  considering the risk of losing the deal entirely.  It's also significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
