"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low. How about we settle on $1,090,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's try to find common ground.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,090,000. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. I hope we can meet at this price.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
