Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering the product at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes the potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $11,500 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** It's essential to price above the guaranteed sale price to John ($10,000).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price appealing to Bob and ensuring Alice doesn't lose potential profit."
