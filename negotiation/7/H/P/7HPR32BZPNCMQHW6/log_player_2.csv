"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $950,000. This offers a significant return for me while still providing you with substantial savings compared to its true worth of $1,200,000. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Targeting Alice's Value:** We know Alice values the product at $800,000. While aiming for this price directly might be too aggressive initially, it's good to set the expectation that you're looking for a price significantly lower than her starting point. 
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a respectful and positive tone throughout the negotiation is crucial for a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your feedback. To better align with your budget while still ensuring a fair return for us, I propose a price of $875,000. This remains higher than your initial offer but is more in line with current market conditions and our cost structure. I hope this revised proposal meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  Alice decreased her offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, the new price of $875,000 is still significantly higher than her known value of $800,000 and our target price. 
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:** Continuously rejecting offers without counter-proposing could lead to a stalemate. It's important to show flexibility while moving closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $837,500? This shows I'm serious about buying and recognizes the value of your product."", ""product_price"": 837500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By offering to meet in the middle between her previous offer ($875,000) and our previous counteroffer ($800,000), we signal a desire to find a compromise. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still leaves room for Alice to potentially lower the price further, while also keeping us well below our maximum budget and John's alternative offer.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  Continuing to express appreciation for Alice's effort in negotiation helps build a collaborative atmosphere and increases the likelihood of reaching a deal."
