"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm happy to discuss further, but I'm looking to pay $1,300,000. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1300000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $1,350,000, which is within Bob's budget and closer to his ideal price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might raise her price again or reject further counteroffers.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that saves Bob a significant amount compared to John's price."
