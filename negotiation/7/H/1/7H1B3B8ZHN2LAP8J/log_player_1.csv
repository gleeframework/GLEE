Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable value:** This gives you some room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive and allows for a potential mutually beneficial outcome. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to our minimum acceptable value, it's still lower than our initial offer.  We have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to our desired price. We want to see if we can reach a compromise without resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This offer is a midpoint between our previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Still above our minimum:**  This offer is still above our minimum acceptable value, allowing for potential profit. 
* **Showing flexibility:**  By adjusting our price, we demonstrate our willingness to negotiate and reach a deal."
