"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I can offer it for $10,800. This feels like a fair compromise.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,200? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",10200.0,Bob,4,
