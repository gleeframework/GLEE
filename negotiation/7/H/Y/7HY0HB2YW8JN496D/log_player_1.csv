Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $175 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) but below what I believe the product is worth to me. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counteroffer without me feeling like I'm losing too much.
* **Building Rapport:** The friendly message helps establish a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'm ready to move on to John, ensuring I don't get stuck in a drawn-out negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, he's shown interest. There's a possibility of reaching a mutually acceptable price through counteroffers. 
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:**  Selling to John guarantees $150, but I'm hoping for a better outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a significant loss.  
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Leaving Room for a Deal:** $140 is still above my minimum, leaving space for a final negotiation if necessary.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and open to discussion, keeping the negotiation productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $130 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with John's offer of $150.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and potentially lead to further counteroffers.  Accepting $130 secures a sale and avoids a possible stalemate."
