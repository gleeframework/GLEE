Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point.  I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
