"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $1500000 is at the top of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1200000.  This allows for some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering I'm ready to purchase immediately.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1400000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still above my target price. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $1300000? This would allow for a more substantial savings for me, while still allowing you to achieve a profitable sale.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your target price, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $1350000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
