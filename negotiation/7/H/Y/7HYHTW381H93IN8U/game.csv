"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than $11,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  That's the very best I can do.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I really think the product is worth more than $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $12,500. I'm getting a bit closer to your price, but I still think this is a fair offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can finally make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I'll make one more counteroffer: $12,250. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you at this point. Let's see if we can make a deal.",12250.0,Alice,7,
