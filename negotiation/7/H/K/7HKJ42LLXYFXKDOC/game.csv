"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $800,000 is the top of your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product.",815000.0,Alice,5,
