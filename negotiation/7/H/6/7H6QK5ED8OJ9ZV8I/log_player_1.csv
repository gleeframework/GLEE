"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit above my minimum. I'm confident Bob will counter-offer since he values the product at $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I need to get at least $1,200,000 for the product. I'll reject his offer and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum and hopefully closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,107,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,107,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm going to try to push for more.  I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1180000}
```

I'm coming down to $1,180,000. This is a significant reduction from my last offer, but it's still above my minimum.  I think this is a fair price considering Bob's previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,157,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,157,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've been going back and forth for a while now, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum desired price.  I've got a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, so I'm going to take that and sell the product to him."
