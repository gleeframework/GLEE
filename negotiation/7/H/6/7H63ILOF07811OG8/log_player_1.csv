While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,000,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's a substantial profit over Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and a good return overall.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties with further negotiation. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continued negotiation could lead to Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures the deal. 
 
While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, the certainty of a $1,000,000 deal with Bob outweighs the potential for an extra $200,000, which is not guaranteed."
