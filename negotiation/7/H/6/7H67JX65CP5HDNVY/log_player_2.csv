"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering this product, Alice! However, $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a significantly lower counteroffer than your target price. This gives room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and expresses interest in the product while clearly stating the offered price is too high. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering $60, we're leaving considerable room for Alice to counter and still allow us to reach a price that's good for both of us (ideally well below $80)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $90 for the product. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $90 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above our maximum budget of $80. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving from $150 to $90. This suggests there's potential to reach a price within our budget.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the safety net of buying from John for $80 if negotiations with Alice don't yield a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $75, we're splitting the difference between her current offer ($90) and our previous counteroffer ($60). This shows willingness to compromise while moving closer to our target price.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  Framing the offer as ""fair for both of us"" emphasizes a win-win outcome and might make Alice more receptive.
* **Remaining Below Budget:**  The offer keeps us within our $80 budget while leaving some room for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $80, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Budget:** Alice's offer of $80 matches our maximum budget. 
* **No Guarantee of Better:** While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, especially since she stated this is her lowest price.  
* **Equal to Alternative:**  Buying from John would also cost us $80. There's no advantage in switching to John at this point. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $80 is the best course of action."
