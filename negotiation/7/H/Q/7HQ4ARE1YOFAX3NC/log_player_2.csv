"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer at a lower price. This is a common negotiation tactic and doesn't necessarily mean it's true.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a backup option with John at $1,500,000. This means you don't have to accept Alice's offer.
* **Potential Savings:** There's a potential to save $100,000 if you can get the product for John's price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you call her bluff. She might be willing to negotiate lower, especially since her ideal price ($1,200,000) is significantly lower than her current offer. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on John's offer."
