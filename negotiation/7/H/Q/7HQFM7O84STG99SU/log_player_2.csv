"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $1,000,000, while John wants $1,200,000. 
* **It's within your budget:**  The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to you, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John."
