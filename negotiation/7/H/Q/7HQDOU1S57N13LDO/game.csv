"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  Let's see if we can find common ground. I'd like to counter with $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to accept $975,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a substantial increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but I'm still not ready to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
