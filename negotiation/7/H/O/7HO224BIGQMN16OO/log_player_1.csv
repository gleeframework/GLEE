Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant profit for me and leaves room for potential negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay more than $8,000 since the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to make a good profit. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $10,000,  Bob has come up to my previous counteroffer, and I'm confident that further negotiation is unlikely to get me a better deal.  I'll accept the $9,500 and move on."
