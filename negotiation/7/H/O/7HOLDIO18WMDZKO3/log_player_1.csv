``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit below Bob's perceived value, but still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This price is fair and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than I hoped, but it's still above my minimum. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm looking for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of the product.  How about $1,350,000? This price is still fair and would allow for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still allows me to earn a decent profit.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get us to an agreement."
