"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you say?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $145, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 was still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to compromise again and sell it to you for $155. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",155.0,Alice,5,
