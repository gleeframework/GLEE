"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider my counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $875000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
