Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly lowering her price, she's unlikely to go below $100. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $100, which meets your needs."
