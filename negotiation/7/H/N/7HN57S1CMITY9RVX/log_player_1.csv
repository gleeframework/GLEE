{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it's close to my minimum price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. Here's why:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below my minimum:** This protects my profit margin and ensures I'm not giving away the product too cheaply.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows I'm serious about selling, but also willing to negotiate.

I'll be ready to respond to Bob's counteroffer, or move on to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum price and doesn't leave much room for further negotiation. 

I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $12,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.  Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12,250. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $12,250 is still below my desired price, it's a good compromise.  I'm getting close to my minimum, and Bob seems genuinely interested in the product.  Rather than risk losing him and ending up selling to John for $15,000, I'll accept his offer."
