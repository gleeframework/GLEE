"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident will bring significant benefit to your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,400,000.  This represents a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will generate significant returns. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. Since you have a backup option with John, it's wiser to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price or explore other options."
