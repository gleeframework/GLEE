I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  I'll be watching closely for Bob's reaction to see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my preferred price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise -  it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that it's a good enough price to convince him to buy, but it also keeps me from losing too much money."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $12,500 is a decent amount and significantly better than selling to John.  I'm happy to close this deal and move on."
