"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. This takes into account its unique benefits and potential for your business.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to make sense for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is far below its true market value and the benefit it can bring to your operations. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's significant potential for growth and ROI.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  This product would be valuable to me, but I have budget constraints. I could go up to $950,000.  That's a significant offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I need you to meet me closer to the product's real value. Let's be realistic, you wouldn't be engaging in this negotiation unless you saw the potential for significant returns. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right that I see potential in the product, but $1,700,000 is still too far off for me.  Your last counteroffer didn't move us much closer. If you're truly serious about making a deal, I'm willing to go to $1,100,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a realistic price.  However, we both know this product is worth significantly more than your current offer. I'm willing to make one more move to seal the deal today: $1,450,000. This is a firm offer, and I need a decision today.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I can respect that. This back and forth tells me we both see the value in this deal.  I'm willing to stretch my budget further, but this is my final offer. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
