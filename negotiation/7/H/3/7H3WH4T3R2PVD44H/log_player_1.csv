"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. This takes into account its unique benefits and potential for your business."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""unique benefits"" and ""potential,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of value above the $1,000,000 he initially perceives. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer is a way to test Bob's willingness to engage in a negotiation. His response will provide valuable information for our next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to make sense for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum ($1,500,000) and his perceived value ($1,000,000).  Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is far below its true market value and the benefit it can bring to your operations. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's significant potential for growth and ROI."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We need to show Bob we're willing to negotiate, but not too drastically. Coming down by $350,000 is a significant decrease that demonstrates flexibility.
* **Reiterating Value:**  It's important to keep emphasizing the product's value proposition, focusing on aspects like ""market value"" and ""ROI"" that resonate with Bob as a buyer. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While this counteroffer shows movement, it still keeps us well above Bob's offer and provides room for further negotiation towards a potentially profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  This product would be valuable to me, but I have budget constraints. I could go up to $950,000.  That's a significant offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer increased by only $150,000 from his previous offer, suggesting he might be negotiating slowly. 
* **Below Value:**  Even with his increase, the offer remains significantly below both your minimum and his own perceived value of the product.
* **Alternative Available:** The option to sell to John for $1,500,000 is looking more attractive, especially if Bob's increases continue to be so incremental. We'll use the next round to push for a more significant jump."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I need you to meet me closer to the product's real value. Let's be realistic, you wouldn't be engaging in this negotiation unless you saw the potential for significant returns. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  We're nearing a point where we need to signal the seriousness of our position.  By stating ""this is my final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency. 
* **Justifying the Price:** We're reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential returns, implicitly urging him to reconsider his budget limitations in light of the bigger picture.
* **Strategic Concession:** While firm, we're still making a reasonable concession of $200,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while keeping the price within a range closer to our goal.
* **Preparing for a Decision:** This offer is designed to elicit a more significant response from Bob. Based on his reaction, we'll decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right that I see potential in the product, but $1,700,000 is still too far off for me.  Your last counteroffer didn't move us much closer. If you're truly serious about making a deal, I'm willing to go to $1,100,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the ""Final Offer"":**  Bob's response to our ""final offer"" suggests he might be willing to go higher. A jump to $1,100,000 indicates he's becoming more serious.
* **Still Below Target:** However, $1,100,000 remains significantly below our $1,500,000 goal and selling to John is still a viable option.
* **Time to Push:** With four rounds remaining, we have some leverage. Rejecting this offer will demonstrate our commitment to securing a price closer to the product's true value. We'll use the next counteroffer to bridge the gap more aggressively."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a realistic price.  However, we both know this product is worth significantly more than your current offer. I'm willing to make one more move to seal the deal today: $1,450,000. This is a firm offer, and I need a decision today."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:**  By coming down to $1,450,000, we're sending a strong signal that we're serious about closing the deal, but not desperate enough to accept an offer much lower than our goal.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We're reiterating the limited time frame (""one more move,"" ""decision today"") to encourage Bob to act quickly and prevent the negotiation from stalling.
* **Leaving Room for John:** This price point allows us a small buffer above John's guaranteed offer. If Bob refuses, we can still walk away and sell to John without a loss. 
* **Testing Commitment:** This offer will reveal how committed Bob truly is. A positive response likely means we're close to an agreement. If he refuses, we can confidently move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough! I can respect that. This back and forth tells me we both see the value in this deal.  I'm willing to stretch my budget further, but this is my final offer. How about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has countered with another ""final offer,"" this time only increasing by $100,000. This suggests his willingness to move further is likely very limited.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing a guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000. With only two rounds remaining, securing a significantly better deal with Bob seems unlikely. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures we achieve our minimum desired outcome without further risk or time investment. While we could potentially squeeze a bit more from Bob, the difference is not substantial enough to justify the risk. 

It's time to move on and finalize the deal with John."
