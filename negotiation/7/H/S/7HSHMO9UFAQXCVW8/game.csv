"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product for a limited time. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and is still a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value you placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your valuation. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to get us to a mutually agreeable price. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
