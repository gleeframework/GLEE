Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to continue the process for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a good compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I believe there's a good chance that Bob will be willing to go higher, especially since he's already shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to offer $910,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. I believe this is a good compromise and could lead to a quick and mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $910,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I believe there's a good chance that Bob will be willing to go up to $920,000, especially since he's already shown a willingness to compromise and has demonstrated a strong desire to purchase the product.  I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiations."
