"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a good compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to offer $910,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. I believe this is a good compromise and could lead to a quick and mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal at this price.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to drop my price to $920,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and a good compromise.  Let's seal the deal and move forward.  What do you say?",920000.0,Alice,7,
