Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $1,400,000 is less than what Bob is willing to pay ($1,500,000), giving him a good incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob is hesitant, you can potentially negotiate a little higher, but you have a backup plan if he rejects."
