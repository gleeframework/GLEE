"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1200000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This reflects the true value of the product and provides you with a fair price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth $1700000, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1350000. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 simply doesn't cover the true value of this product. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer it to you for $1550000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1550000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
