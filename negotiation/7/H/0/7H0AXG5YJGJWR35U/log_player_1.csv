"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and focuses on the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond and provides an opportunity for him to counteroffer.

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started and establish a baseline for further discussions.  I'll be prepared to adjust my price depending on Bob's response and the progression of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1000000.  This product is very valuable to me, but that's my absolute maximum budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would leave me with a significant loss. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a compromise that benefits us both. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,100,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also maintaining my desired profit margin. 
* **Time Management:** I'm aware that I have only 10 rounds, so I will need to be strategic in my counteroffers to find a solution quickly.
* **John's offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'll aim to close the deal with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that the price is fair for both parties. This encourages Bob to view the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Positive Language:** The message is still positive and emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm mindful of the limited rounds, so I'm aiming for a quicker resolution.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to decide if I want to continue negotiating or move on to John's offer.
* With each round, I'll become increasingly more inclined to consider John's offer if a deal with Bob seems unlikely."
