{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,999. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Alternative Guaranteed:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a strong fallback position. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Odd Pricing:** The $11,999 price feels less like a rounded-up number and might be perceived as a more carefully considered ""deal"".

**It's important to note:** This is a single-shot negotiation. There's no opportunity to go back and forth. This offer balances ambition with a high probability of securing a sale above Alice's minimum acceptable price."
