```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're committed to your offer of $8,500, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,800. This is my best and final offer below $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, even if it's close. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $9,150. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9,800, so I can offer it to you for $9,650. This is my best and final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,650 is still above my budget. While I could risk another round of negotiation,  I'm running out of time and don't want to risk ending up with a price I can't afford. I'll buy the product from John for $8,000."
