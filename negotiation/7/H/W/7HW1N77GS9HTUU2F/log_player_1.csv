Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is of great value to you. My asking price is $9,500.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
This offer gives me a good profit margin while still being attractive to Bob. He has a higher perceived value for the product, so there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to find a price closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite enough. I'm hesitant to continue negotiating with Bob, as he's already shown a reluctance to meet my price expectations. John is a guaranteed sale at $8,000, which is a safer option."
