"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum value, it's not a profitable sale. I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob, and I have 8 more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still a respectable profit margin. It shows a willingness to compromise, but it also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough to Bob while still giving me a decent return on my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd still prefer a higher price,  $1,100,000 is a good profit and it's getting closer to my minimum value. We're only on round 4, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for $1,000,000."
