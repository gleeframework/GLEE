"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
