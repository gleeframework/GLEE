Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  While you know Bob values the product at $80, you can't use this information directly. Offering him the product at or slightly above $80 might work, but it leaves a lot of potential profit on the table.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), there's no risk of getting stuck with the product.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you can always go a bit lower if needed.  
* **The Psychology:** A price of $140 feels like a ""deal"" compared to a higher initial asking price. It might make Bob feel like he's getting a good bargain even though it's significantly more than his perceived value.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $140. He might be a tough negotiator or simply not interested at that price. But, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy."
