"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $90 is a bit too low for me considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $120. Can you consider this offer?",92.0,Bob,4,
