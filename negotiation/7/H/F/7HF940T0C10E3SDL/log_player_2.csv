"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is well above his budget and he can get the same product from John for less.  It makes sense to see if he can get a better deal from Alice first."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.
