Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has a safety net with John's offer of $10,000. This knowledge allows her to confidently aim higher with Bob."
