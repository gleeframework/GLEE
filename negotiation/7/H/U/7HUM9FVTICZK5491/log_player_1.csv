"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me, and it gives you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than what I initially offered, it's still significantly below the value of the product to me. I'm not willing to sell it for that price yet, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to cover your costs and makes this deal beneficial for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now at the exact value of the product to him. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good outcome considering the limited rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether and I'm confident I can make up the difference elsewhere."
