"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's a good deal compared to its value to her, it's still above your maximum budget.
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, and you can use them to try and get a better price.
* **John's offer is your fallback.** You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so you have leverage in negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me, and it gives you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  By starting at $950,000, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to be aggressive.  This price is still below her minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Appealing to her profit margin:** I'm highlighting the profit she would still make at this price, making it more enticing for her to accept.
* **Setting the stage for further negotiations:** This counteroffer creates a starting point for further negotiation in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she has lowered the price, $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.** We are only in round 3, and there's still room for me to get a better price.
* **John's offer remains my fallback.** I know I can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, which makes me more comfortable holding out for a lower price from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to cover your costs and makes this deal beneficial for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer. It's my maximum budget and aligns with John's offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** Emphasize the ""fair"" price and how it benefits both parties, pushing Alice towards accepting.
* **Urgency & Finality:** The message conveys a sense of urgency, implying that this is a final opportunity for Alice to close the deal."
