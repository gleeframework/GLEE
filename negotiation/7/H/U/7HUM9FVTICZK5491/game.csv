"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me, and it gives you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to cover your costs and makes this deal beneficial for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
