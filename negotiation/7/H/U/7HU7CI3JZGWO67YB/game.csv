"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $13250 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $12750? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I understand that we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $13375 for the product. It's a compromise that I believe is fair and reflects the value of the product.",13375.0,Alice,5,
