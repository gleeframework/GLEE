"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $12,000, which is still higher than Bob's target price.
* **Strategy:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John:** While this is an option, it's not the most cost-effective choice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Start with a significant drop from Alice's offer to show Bob's seriousness about negotiating. 
* **$10,000:** This price is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is polite but firm, and it clearly states Bob's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  Let me know if you're still interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially get a better price.
* **Buying from John:** This is still not the most cost-effective option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. I'm still hoping to get it for $10,000. Would you consider that? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Stick with the previous offer of $10,000. This shows Bob is serious about his price point but is open to negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is polite but persistent, reminding Alice of the potential win-win situation."
