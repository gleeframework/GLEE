Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies that the price is justified without explicitly stating the product is worth $8,000 to her.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While Alice has a backup buyer, she doesn't want to reveal this to Bob. It weakens her negotiating position.  

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged."
