"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit below my asking price.  To be fair, could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

$17,000 is still above your budget. You can try to negotiate further, or you can go with John's offer."
