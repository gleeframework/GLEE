Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat-out rejects it, I know he might be significantly far off from my valuation. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $12,000 confirms he values the product significantly lower than I do. However, it also shows he's interested.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a large gap between our valuations, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:** I can leverage John's offer to push for a higher price from Bob. 

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but still above John's offer to encourage further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit below my asking price.  To be fair, could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer suggests a willingness to compromise while still remaining significantly above both Bob's offer and John's guaranteed purchase price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This price point allows me to see how serious Bob is and how much he's willing to budge from his initial offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By staying well above $15,000, I retain my leverage and the option to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $14,000,  which is a good midpoint between our two offers.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gain:**  While Bob is showing more flexibility, his offer of $14,000 is only a small increase from his previous offer and only $1,000 less than John's offer. 
* **Not Worth the Risk:** Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or pushing for an even lower price. The potential gain from continuing to negotiate with Bob is minimal compared to the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John provides a certain $15,000, which is a reasonable profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
