"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a strong opening offer that gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  Since I don't know Bob's value, it's best to start with a higher price.  If he rejects, we can then work our way down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have several rounds left to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counters again. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also maintains a price that is closer to what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  We're getting into the later rounds now, so I might start considering selling to John if Bob continues to lowball me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm dropping my offer to $11,000.  I'm showing flexibility, but I'm also aware that we are approaching the later rounds.  If Bob rejects this offer, I might seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. We only have a few rounds left, so I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and it's getting dangerously close to my minimum. However, I still have a few rounds left, and I believe there's a chance Bob might be willing to go a little higher. If he doesn't, I might seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
