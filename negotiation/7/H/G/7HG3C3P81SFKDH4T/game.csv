"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $8,200? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",8200.0,Bob,4,
