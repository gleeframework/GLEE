Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high as to be immediately rejected. It also leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a potential win-win scenario.  I'm prepared to drop the price if needed, but I'm also comfortable walking away and selling to John if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $9,800 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to my minimum.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer.  I'll accept his offer and move forward with the sale."
