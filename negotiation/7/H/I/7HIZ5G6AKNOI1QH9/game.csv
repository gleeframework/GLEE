"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your initial offer.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $9,000, so how about we settle on $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle again - how about $10,000? This price is fair for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
