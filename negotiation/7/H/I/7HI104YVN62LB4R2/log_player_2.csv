# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique item for $15,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $8,000."
