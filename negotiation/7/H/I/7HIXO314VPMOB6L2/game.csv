"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $9,500?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit. How about we say $11,500? That's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm on a tight budget. My absolute final offer is $10,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you a deal for $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're interested, it's a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a great price.",11000.0,Alice,7,
