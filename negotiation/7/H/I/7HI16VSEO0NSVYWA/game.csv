"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. It's worth $1,200,000 to me, and I'm sure it will be equally valuable to you.  To start, I'm offering it for $1,400,000. This allows for some room for negotiation, but I'm confident it's a fair price given its value.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I am hoping we can find a price closer to what I believe its worth to me. I would like to propose an offer of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand we both value this product, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This allows us both to gain value from this transaction.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,225,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
