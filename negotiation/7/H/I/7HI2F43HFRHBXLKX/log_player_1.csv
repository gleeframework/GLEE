Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $900,000 is higher than $800,000, which means Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** I'm still above my $1,000,000 minimum, which means I'm not losing money.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This leaves room for me to potentially reach a deal closer to my desired price. 

I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me. While I'm open to negotiating, I won't accept a price that's so far below my minimum.  

I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If Bob is unwilling to move closer to my desired price, I'll consider selling to John for $1,000,000."

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'm not sure if there's a lot of room for negotiation, but I believe I can get a higher price.

I'll counteroffer Bob again, but this time I'll be more firm in my counteroffer. I'll need to find a price that both sides can agree on without me losing too much money. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $800,000 is closer to my desired price and is getting near my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss, especially since I know John is willing to pay my asking price. 

I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John, and it's not worth risking my time and effort on further negotiations with Bob."
