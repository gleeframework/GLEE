Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $15,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob hesitates while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Exclusivity Appeal:** Highlighting that this is a pre-market offer might make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he may not be willing to pay that full amount.  Be prepared to adjust your offer based on his response.
* **Negotiation:** This is just the opening offer. Be ready to negotiate with Bob to find a price that works for both of you."
