# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that's still very competitive, but also allows me to get a fair return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
