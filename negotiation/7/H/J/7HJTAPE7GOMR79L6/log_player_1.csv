Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000 offer:**  This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's valuation of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly message:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting that it's a ""great deal"" for Bob can make him more inclined to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  Starting higher allows for the possibility of a price closer to $9,000.
* **Allows for flexibility:**  By being open to negotiation, we can potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Provides a backup option:**  Knowing that we can sell to John for $8,000 gives us a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am only able to offer $8,000 for it. This is the maximum amount I am willing to spend. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer matches our minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is our minimum acceptable price. 
* **No reason to risk further negotiation:**  While we could try for a higher price, it's not guaranteed.  There's a chance that Bob would reject our counteroffer and we would end up selling to John at the same price.
* **Time is valuable:**  Accepting Bob's offer saves time and allows us to move on to other opportunities.

**In this scenario, it's more strategically sound to secure the $8,000 sale with Bob rather than risking a longer negotiation that could ultimately result in the same price.**"
