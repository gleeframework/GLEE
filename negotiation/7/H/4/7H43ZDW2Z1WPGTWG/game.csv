"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and save some money for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000.

This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
