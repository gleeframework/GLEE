Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit.  This also allows for some room to negotiate if Bob counters. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if I can push for a better price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I've lowered my offer to $1,400,000 to show I'm willing to negotiate. This is a good middle ground and hopefully will convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price.  There's a chance I could get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, but it's risky.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit and minimizes the chance of losing out to John."
