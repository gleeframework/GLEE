Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but it still gives me a decent profit margin. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. To avoid getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I reach my desired profit margin and avoids the risk of a lower price."
