"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the product's significant potential.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $950,000 to make this work. Can we meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,6,
