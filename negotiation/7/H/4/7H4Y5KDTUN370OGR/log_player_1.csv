Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the product's significant potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to John's offer, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $950,000 to make this work. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob is unlikely to move significantly higher, and we're running out of rounds.  It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
