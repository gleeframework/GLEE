"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling the product for $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a significant advantage over my other offers, and it's a fair price for a product that's worth so much to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still looking to minimize my costs. Could we meet somewhere closer to $750,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still securing the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. Let's settle on $800,000.  This price reflects the product's value while allowing you to secure it within your budget. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
