{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential gains and shows that I'm confident in the product's value.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using a positive tone and highlighting the benefits of the deal for both parties. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm ready to negotiate, which will be apparent in my subsequent responses to Bob's counteroffers (if any).
* **Backup Plan:** I'm mindful of John's offer, which serves as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling the product for $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:**  I have room to negotiate further. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counter-offer closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer as safety net:**  While John's offer is a guaranteed sale, I'm not yet desperate enough to accept Bob's low offer.  There's still a chance to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a significant advantage over my other offers, and it's a fair price for a product that's worth so much to you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate by offering a counter-offer.
* **Splitting the difference:**  My offer is a compromise that meets Bob halfway. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him and how my offer is still beneficial.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not giving in entirely, leaving room for another round of negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still looking to minimize my costs. Could we meet somewhere closer to $750,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still securing the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not yet desperate enough to accept it.  John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum.
* **Room for counter-offer:** I can still push for a higher price by making a counter-offer. I believe there is still room for a mutually acceptable agreement closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. Let's settle on $800,000.  This price reflects the product's value while allowing you to secure it within your budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is my absolute minimum, and I'm framing it as a final compromise to show that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** My offer is a clear compromise that demonstrates my willingness to find a solution.
* **Time Pressure (Implied):**  While not explicitly stated, my tone suggests that this might be my last offer. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price that meets my minimum requirements. 

If Bob rejects, I will accept John's offer to secure the $800,000 sale."
