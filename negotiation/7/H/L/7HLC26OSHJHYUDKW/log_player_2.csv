Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to my original price. How about $1,000,000? This price would still allow you to acquire the product at a significant value while ensuring I can recoup a reasonable amount of my investment. Let's keep this conversation going.
