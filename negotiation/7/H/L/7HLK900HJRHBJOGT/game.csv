"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let's talk.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal than your initial offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,150,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need at least $1,250,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,175,000. This is my best compromise for now.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand you're trying to keep the price down, but $1,175,000 still doesn't reflect the value of the product for me.  I'm willing to drop to $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
