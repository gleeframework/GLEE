{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $925,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize it!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell for less than $800,000 (her guaranteed sale to John).
* **Aim for Maximum:** Alice wants to maximize her profit.

Offering the product at $925,000 creates a win-win situation:

* **Bob saves:** Bob saves $75,000 compared to his valuation.
* **Alice profits:** Alice makes a significant profit of $125,000 above her minimum.

This price point is aggressive enough to maximize Alice's potential profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
