Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to encourage negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  A price of $9,500 leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially settle at a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **John as Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price. This gives me leverage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe I can get a better price through further negotiation.  
* **John's Offer:** I'm confident John will buy the product for $10,000, so I have the luxury of rejecting Bob's low offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I remind Bob that the product is still a good deal at $9,000, emphasizing the potential value he'll gain.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I'm willing to stretch a bit, but I really need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $8,750 is still significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Further negotiation with Bob could lead to even lower offers, potentially leaving me with less profit or even a loss. 
* **Guarantee with John:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, which is my minimum desired price. There's no risk of further negotiation or a lower offer with John.

By selling to John, I ensure I receive my minimum desired profit and avoid the potential downsides of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
