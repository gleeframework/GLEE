Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had from others, I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value"" and ""interest from others"" creates a sense of demand and justifies the higher price. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always negotiate down, but you shouldn't go below $15,000 as you have a guaranteed sale at that price with John."
