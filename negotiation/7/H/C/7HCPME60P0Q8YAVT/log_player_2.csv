"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product for less than it's worth to you, and I get a fair price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $14,000.  Since the product is only worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This still gives you a good profit, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $13500? That's still a good deal for you, as it's less than what the product is worth to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:** Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  John's price is $15,000, which is significantly higher than Alice's current offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go much lower than $13,500.  

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob at this point, as it saves him $1,500 compared to buying from John."
