"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.  What do you say about $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your target price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price of $10,000.  $11,500 is still a good deal for you, saving you $3,500 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this situation."
