"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high price allows for negotiation room and sets a strong starting point. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The price is above Bob's perceived value, encouraging him to negotiate. 
* **Below John's Value:**  The price is still below John's offer, ensuring you don't miss out on a guaranteed $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to test the waters and see how willing Bob is to negotiate. If he rejects, we can then lower the price in subsequent rounds to encourage him to reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss. 
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum, potentially leading to a more favorable deal.
* **John's Offer Remains:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum value. However, I still have a chance to secure a higher price with Bob, so I'm willing to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

This round demonstrates my commitment to achieving a price closer to my target. By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a low price and encourage further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lowering the Price:** My counteroffer drops the price from my initial $1,750,000 to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  The counteroffer is still above my minimum value of $1,500,000. This ensures that any agreement with Bob is profitable for me.
* **Testing Bob's Willingness:** This counteroffer allows me to assess Bob's commitment to the deal and see if he's willing to meet me halfway.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to reach a compromise that is acceptable to both parties.  The strategy is to gradually lower the price while still staying above my minimum, potentially pushing Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it remains below my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would still result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I am still hopeful that a more favorable deal can be reached. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further counteroffers.
* **John's Offer Provides Security:** Even though I am rejecting Bob's offer, I am confident that I can get a better price. John's offer acts as a safety net, guaranteeing my minimum value if the negotiations with Bob fail.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, I am showing Bob that I am serious about getting a price closer to my target.  The strategy is to continue to negotiate with Bob, but with the knowledge that I have a secure fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm further lowering my offer, showing flexibility and a desire to close the deal. This price is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value.
* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer significantly narrows the gap between our positions, making it more attractive for Bob to accept. 
* **Testing Bob's Commitment:**  This counteroffer is a strong signal that I am serious about reaching a deal with Bob. If he rejects this, it could mean that a deal is not possible, and I might have to turn to John.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to make a substantial concession to encourage Bob to accept the offer. This is a strategic move to test Bob's willingness to meet me halfway and close the deal. If he rejects, I will need to reconsider my options and decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  Even though Bob has increased his offer, it is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is Stalemated:**  With only a few rounds remaining, the negotiations seem to be stuck. Bob is not willing to meet my minimum, and I am not willing to settle for a lower price.
* **John's Offer is Attractive:** Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum value, and with time running out, it becomes a more appealing option.

**Strategy:**

While I am still hoping for a better deal with Bob, the odds are not in my favor. The time pressure and the fact that Bob is not willing to come up to my minimum value makes selling to John the more logical choice at this point.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I am signaling that I am ready to move on to a more secure alternative."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This is my final counteroffer, a price that meets my absolute minimum value. I am signaling that I am willing to close the deal at this price, but any lower offer would be unacceptable. 
* **High Stakes:** With only three rounds remaining, the pressure is on. I am hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and finally agree to my terms.
* **John's Offer is Ready:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will immediately turn to John to secure the guaranteed sale for $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

This final counteroffer is a calculated risk.  I am hoping to convince Bob to agree to my terms, but if he doesn't, I am prepared to walk away and secure my minimum value with John. This strategy is based on the assumption that Bob wants the product and might be willing to meet my price with only a few rounds remaining."
