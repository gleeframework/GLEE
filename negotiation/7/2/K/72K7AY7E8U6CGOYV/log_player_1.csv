"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm going to start with a slightly higher price than the product's value to Bob. This allows room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if Bob rejects my first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is still a good price, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price that is closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob. It's worth exploring if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting too low for me. I'm not willing to go that low, especially with John offering me my target price. It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
