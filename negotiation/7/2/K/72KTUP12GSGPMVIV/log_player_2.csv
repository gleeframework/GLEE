Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $910,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $915,000 as a final compromise.  This price is fair considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can still try to negotiate a lower price, he only has three rounds left.  If he rejects Alice's offer, she might not come down any further, and he may end up having to buy from John for $800,000.  Accepting Alice's offer at $915,000 is a good deal, especially since he's already saved a significant amount compared to her initial asking price."
