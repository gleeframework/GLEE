,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product. It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in it. Let's find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a fair compromise. This price is within my budget and reflects the value I see in the product. I believe this is a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for $925,000.  This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding out for a specific price, but $925,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $910,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds. If not, I may have to explore other options.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $910,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $915,000 as a final compromise.  This price is fair considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's seal the deal.",915000.0,Alice,7,
