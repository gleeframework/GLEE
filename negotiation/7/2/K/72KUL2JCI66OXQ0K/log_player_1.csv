Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $125 is better than $120, I still have some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $135? This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $135. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. I'm getting close to my budget, and I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer for $130. It's a good price, and I'm confident that I can make a profit on the sale. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and me having to sell to John for a lower price isn't worth it."
