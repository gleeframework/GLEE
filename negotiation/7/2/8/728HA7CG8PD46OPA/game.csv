"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This price still allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's continue this conversation and see if we can find common ground.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
