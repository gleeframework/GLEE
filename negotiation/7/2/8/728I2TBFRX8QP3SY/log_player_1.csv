Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also reflects the minimum value I place on the product. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, but I'm hoping this initial offer is attractive enough to get the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still reflects the value I believe the product holds. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $16,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good compromise.  It's more than what John would pay and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
