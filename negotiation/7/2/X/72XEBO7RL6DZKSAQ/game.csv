"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 at this time.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 is my initial asking price, I could come down to $170 for you. That's significantly less than its true value.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $170 is still more than I can comfortably spend. How about $100?  This is a fair compromise, given its worth to you and my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? That's my final offer.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $135 is closer, but still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,6,
