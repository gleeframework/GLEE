"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but her starting price is $120. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's too early to buy from John.** You haven't explored Alice's potential for a better price. 
* **Rejection allows for negotiation.** Rejecting the offer will open the door for you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can meet you halfway between $100 and $120, so I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price.**  The price dropped from $120 to $110, showing Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* **The price is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $150, and $110 is significantly lower than that.
* **Accepting now saves time and effort.**  While you could try to get a lower price, accepting this offer ensures you get the product without further negotiation."
