"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. $10,250 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to come up to $10,400? I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $10,400 is the best value for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200. Can you consider that?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,200.  I'm willing to go down to $10,300 as a final compromise.  This is a great price for both of us, and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with.",10300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250 again, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,8,
