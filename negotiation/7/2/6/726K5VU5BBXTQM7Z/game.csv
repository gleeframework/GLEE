"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $8,250. That's my final offer.",8250.0,Bob,4,
