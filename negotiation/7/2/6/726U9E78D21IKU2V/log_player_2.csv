"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it would be a great fit for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  The product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $130?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
