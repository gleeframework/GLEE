# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  It's worth continuing negotiations to see if Alice will come down further.  Rejecting the offer allows for another round of counteroffers."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $1,050,000 is still too high. Bob has already shown a willingness to compromise, and it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $975,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $1,025,000 is still above Bob's comfort zone. The negotiations have been lengthy, and it seems unlikely Alice will budge further.  At this point, it's more financially beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000. This guarantees a lower price and a quicker transaction."
