"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and offers a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about acquiring the product. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
