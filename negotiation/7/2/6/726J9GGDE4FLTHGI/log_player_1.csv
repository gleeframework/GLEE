{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum. I've made several counteroffers, and it seems like we're at an impasse. Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting a worse price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures a profitable sale and avoids any further risk of losing money."
