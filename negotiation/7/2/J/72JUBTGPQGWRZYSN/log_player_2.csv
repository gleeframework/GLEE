"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,550,000.  This gives you a slight margin for potential future gains, and allows me to secure a price that reflects its true value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Since you can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
