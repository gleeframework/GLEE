"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which still reflects a strong value for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 falls quite a bit short of the true value I see in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $910,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the worth of what I'm offering.",910000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $910,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this point.  Let's split the difference and go with $880,000. This price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $880,000 is closer to the mark, I can't let it go for less than $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price reflecting the immense value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,5,
