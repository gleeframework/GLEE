"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's within my budget, it leaves little room for negotiation.  It's better to start by rejecting and making a counteroffer to see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which still reflects a strong value for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 falls quite a bit short of the true value I see in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $910,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $910,000 is still too high. While she's showing willingness to negotiate, I want to see if we can get closer to my initial counteroffer of $850,000.  There's still room for a compromise, and I'm not yet ready to buy from John at $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $910,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this point.  Let's split the difference and go with $880,000. This price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $880,000 is closer to the mark, I can't let it go for less than $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price reflecting the immense value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my ideal price point, and she's declared it her final offer. It's within my budget, and if I reject it, I run the risk of her sticking to her price or potentially increasing it again.  At this point, it's better to accept the offer and avoid the potential of a higher price or having to buy from John at a higher cost."
