Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $13,500.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,200. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and higher than what John would pay.  I'm also worried about the potential for Bob to keep rejecting my offers and ultimately walk away."
