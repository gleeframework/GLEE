"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could get from another buyer.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can finalize the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob can secure the same product from John for a price that fits his budget.  Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
