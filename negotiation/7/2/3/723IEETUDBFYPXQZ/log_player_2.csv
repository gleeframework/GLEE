It's a significant asset with a market value far exceeding that price, and I believe it will be a valuable addition to your portfolio.  I'm confident this is a deal that will be mutually beneficial. However, I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it for $800,000 if you decline. Please consider my offer carefully.
