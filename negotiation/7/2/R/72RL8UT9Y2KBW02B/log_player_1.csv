"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's incredibly valuable, and I believe it would be a great asset to you. I'm initially offering it for $1,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with a strong offer that reflects the product's true value to you. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm anchor point. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will give you insight into how eager Bob is to purchase and how far apart your valuations are. His response will determine your next move. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having a guaranteed buyer in John gives you leverage. You are not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob, knowing you can always walk away and get your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $600,000 is considerably lower than both your valuation ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). Accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a substantial difference between Bob's offer and your minimum. This gap indicates there's space for negotiation to reach a more agreeable price. 
* **Leverage of John:**  You have the security of John's offer, which provides a strong fallback position. You're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and my initial offer reflects that. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down from $1,000,000 to $850,000 shows willingness to negotiate but remains closer to your true value.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's flexibility.  Is he willing to move significantly closer to your range, or is he stuck closer to his initial low offer?
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** By anchoring your offer well above his, you retain negotiating power while encouraging him to engage more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer, which is a positive sign, but the increment is still relatively small compared to the remaining gap between you. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation, and accepting $700,000 now would still be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Applying Pressure:**  Rejecting again emphasizes that you're serious about getting a fair price and encourages Bob to make a more substantial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Price Point:** Offering $800,000 matches Bob's own valuation of the product. This puts pressure on him to accept, as it's unlikely he'll find a better deal elsewhere.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** Presenting this as your ""final offer"" adds weight and urgency to the negotiation. It signals that you're serious and willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Time Management:** With five rounds remaining, you have some buffer to see Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, you can still choose to negotiate further or accept John's offer."
