"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows for a healthy profit for both of us. Let me know if you're interested, and we can finalize the details.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,450,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move forward and purchase the product from John at your desired price."
