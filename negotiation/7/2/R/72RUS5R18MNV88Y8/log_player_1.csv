Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're motivated to sell, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can come to a mutually agreeable price.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's clear he's highly unlikely to meet my minimum price. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting even less."
