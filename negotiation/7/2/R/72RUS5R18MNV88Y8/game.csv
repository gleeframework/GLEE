"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're motivated to sell, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
