"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to leave room for negotiation and gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Open Communication:** The tone is friendly and invites Bob's input, setting a collaborative tone for the negotiation.

By starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum and Bob's perceived value, I hope to:

1. **Maximize potential profit.**
2. **Understand Bob's willingness to pay.** His response will reveal how much he values the product and how aggressively he'll negotiate. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. This is a significant amount of money, and I'd like to be closer to the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle just yet. It's still a significant markup from my minimum, and I believe there's room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer gives me a chance to counter and work towards a more favorable outcome. 

I'm confident I can convince Bob to increase his offer closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I understand your perspective on market value, however, this product offers unique advantages that justify a premium price. How about we meet halfway at $1,850,000?"",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's point about market value but reiterate the product's unique value proposition to justify a higher price.
* **Compromise:** By suggesting we meet halfway, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Strong Position:** I'm not drastically lowering my price, showing Bob I'm firm on the product's worth.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Find a middle ground:**  Balancing Bob's desire for a fair price with my goal of maximizing profit.
2. **Maintain momentum:** Keeping the negotiation moving forward in a positive direction.

I'm hopeful this offer will encourage Bob to continue the negotiation and move closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,850,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a significant profit above my minimum of $1,500,000. While I could push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Walk away:** He's already indicated that $1,750,000 is his upper limit. 
* **Become less willing to negotiate:**  Prolonged back-and-forth could create friction.

Accepting this offer secures a very favorable deal without jeopardizing the negotiation. It's always possible I could get a higher price from another buyer, but the certainty of this offer and the substantial profit make it the most logical decision at this point."
