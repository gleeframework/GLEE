"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to maximize my potential profit. I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so this gives me some room to negotiate. 

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm starting high and seeing what his reaction is. If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is better than my floor price of $12,000, but I'm not satisfied. I believe the product has higher value and want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and try to reach a price that's more beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price of $18,000 and Bob's offer of $14,000. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to accept, as it's still a significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is closer to my floor price, but I'm still not completely satisfied. I believe there's still some room to negotiate, and I'd like to see if I can get closer to $14,000.  By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and try to close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $14,500. This is a compromise between my previous counteroffer of $16,000 and Bob's offer of $13,500. This price is still within a comfortable margin above my minimum price of $12,000 and I believe it could be enticing enough for Bob to accept. I'm aiming to close the deal quickly, as we're getting close to the halfway point in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to close at a higher price, we're at round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating.  I'd rather secure a profit of $1,000 than risk getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for my minimum price."
