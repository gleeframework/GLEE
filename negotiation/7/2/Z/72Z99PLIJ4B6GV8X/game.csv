,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $900000 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This would still be a great value for you and allow me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925000 still falls a bit short of what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm confident that the value of this product will exceed your expectations, and I'm willing to offer one final compromise - $975000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
