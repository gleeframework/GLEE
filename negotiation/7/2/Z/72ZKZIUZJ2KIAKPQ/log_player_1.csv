Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value of $150. 
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high allows for more negotiation room to reach a price closer to $150.
* **Avoid a quick sale to John:** Offering a price that's attractive to Bob increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation and prevents you from having to settle for John's $80 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100** is still a good price, but it's closer to your minimum value of $80. You want to try and get closer to Bob's perceived value of $150.
* **Rejecting the offer** allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price. 

The next step is to counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to your desired outcome, but still fair to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both something to work with."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$110** is a compromise: It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than your initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.

This approach aims to:

* **Secure a better price:** $110 is closer to your desired outcome and still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Maintain good communication:**  Continuing the dialogue keeps the negotiation open and prevents a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $105? Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$105** is a good deal for both parties. It's significantly higher than your minimum of $80 and closer to your desired price than Bob's previous offer. 
* Accepting the offer allows you to sell the product and make a decent profit. 

While it's possible to try and negotiate further, the risk is that Bob might reject your next counteroffer, forcing you to sell to John for a lower price.  It's generally a good idea to accept an offer that's close to your desired price and avoids unnecessary risk."
