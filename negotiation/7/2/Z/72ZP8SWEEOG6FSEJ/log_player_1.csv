Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still securing a profit for myself. I'm confident that I can get a good price, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers don't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I will reject his offer and counter with a price that is closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to keep negotiating.  I believe that $17,500 is still a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is only $500 less than my last offer. I'm willing to accept this to close the deal, as it still provides a good profit. I would rather sell to Bob at $16,500 than to John at $15,000."
