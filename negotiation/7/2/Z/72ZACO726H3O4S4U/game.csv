"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product truly offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $18,000 reflects that more accurately.  What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $18,000 is still beyond my limit. I'm happy to compromise and offer $16,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
