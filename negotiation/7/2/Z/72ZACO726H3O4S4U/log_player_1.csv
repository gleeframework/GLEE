Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product truly offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $18,000 reflects that more accurately.  What do you say?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $18,000 is still beyond my limit. I'm happy to compromise and offer $16,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Taking $16,000 is better than risking a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John for $15,000."
