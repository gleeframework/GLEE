Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and I'm getting too close to my minimum price. Accepting $11,000 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as buyers."
