"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
