Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale. It's higher than your minimum, but still leaves $2500 of potential value on the table for Bob. This makes the offer attractive to him while still securing a decent profit for you. If Bob rejects, you can then sell to John for your minimum price."
