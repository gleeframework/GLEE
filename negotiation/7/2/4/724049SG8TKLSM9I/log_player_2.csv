"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value our conversation, $10500 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $11000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $11,000 is a better offer than Alice's original price, Bob can still get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no reason to keep negotiating with Alice at this point."
