"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is my maximum.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  I know it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to move the deal forward. Let's meet at $12,500. It's still a great price for this product, and I think you'll love it.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,500 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. Let's meet in the middle at $11,250. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. Let's meet at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make it work.",12000.0,Alice,7,
