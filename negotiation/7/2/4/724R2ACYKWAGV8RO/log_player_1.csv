"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can reach an even better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While $11,000 is slightly lower than my initial offer, it's still a good deal, exceeding my minimum of $10,000. It's also likely that Bob won't budge much further, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal."
