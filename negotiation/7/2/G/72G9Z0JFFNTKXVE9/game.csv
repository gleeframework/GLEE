"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $850000? I believe this would still be a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to keep your investment within a certain budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own goals and the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $850000 to make it worth my while. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. I'm glad we're able to find common ground. However, I'm still trying to keep my expenses within a tighter budget. Could you consider reducing the price to $860000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $860000 is enough to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $880000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to reach a fair agreement, Alice. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm still not quite there yet. Could you consider lowering the price to $870000? I believe this would be a reasonable compromise for both of us.",870000.0,Bob,6,
