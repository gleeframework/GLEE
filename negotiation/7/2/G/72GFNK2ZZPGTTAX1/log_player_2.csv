{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.  While it is lower than her previous offer,  Bob is still willing to negotiate and see if he can get a better deal.  He has 5 rounds remaining, so there's still time to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 6

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. Although it's getting closer to his maximum,  he still has 3 rounds left and can try to negotiate a lower price. There's still potential for a better deal, and Bob doesn't want to rush into accepting an offer that is above his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is raising his offer again, but still staying under his maximum price. He's hoping that this counteroffer will finally be acceptable to Alice.  If Alice rejects this offer, there will only be two rounds left, and Bob will have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough call, as Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's maximum. However, there is only one round left and the potential for negotiation is low.  Bob has to weigh the risk of Alice rejecting his final counteroffer against the certainty of buying from John.  

Given that he has already rejected multiple offers above his preferred price, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge in the final round, it's more likely that Alice will reject his counteroffer. Therefore, it makes sense to take the guaranteed deal from John."
