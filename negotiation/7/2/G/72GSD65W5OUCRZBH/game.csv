"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me.  How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $142. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",142.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $142 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $136.  That would be a fair price for both of us.",136.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can do better than that. How about $139? It's a small step up from $136, but it's worth it to me.",139.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $139 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $137?  This would allow us both to close the deal and be happy with the outcome.",137.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $137. How about $138? It's a small step up, but it's worth it to me. Let's see if we can get to a deal!",138.0,Alice,7,
