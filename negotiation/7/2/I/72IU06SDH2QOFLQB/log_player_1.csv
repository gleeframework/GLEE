Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product holds a value of $15,000 for Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Setting the price at $14,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($15,000 - $12,000 = $3,000) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($15,000 - $14,000 = $1,000). 
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, ensuring you don't lose out completely if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and offering Bob a price that's attractive enough to accept."
