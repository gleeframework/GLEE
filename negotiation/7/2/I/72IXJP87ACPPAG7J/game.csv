"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of my product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this product would be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
