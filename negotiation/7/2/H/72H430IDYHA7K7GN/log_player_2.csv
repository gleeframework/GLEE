Alice's offer:

Let's try to negotiate a little further.  Alice is coming down, and we're getting closer to John's price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a deal, but $10,400 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,400, which would be $10,600. It's the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600

It's unlikely we can get Alice below $10,600. John offers the product for $10,000, which is a better deal at this point."
