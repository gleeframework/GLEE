"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $10,800. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. Let me know if you're interested!",10800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $10,800 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,400?",10400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a deal, but $10,400 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,400, which would be $10,600. It's the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested!",10600.0,Alice,5,
