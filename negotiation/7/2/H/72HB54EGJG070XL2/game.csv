"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. I think that's fair considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $11,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to the value I need to get for the product. ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go to $10,500. This is a fair compromise that would allow us to both make a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a final compromise from my end. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum target. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,
