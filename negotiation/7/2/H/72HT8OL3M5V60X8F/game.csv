"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $950000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it can bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,
