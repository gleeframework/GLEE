"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This price still gives you a significant savings and is fair for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to go up.  $11,500 is closer, but it's still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  This is a fair price that recognizes both our needs, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $12,250, which would be $11,875. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11875.0,Bob,6,
