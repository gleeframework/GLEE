"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is a significant profit for me while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Strong Opening:**  My message is friendly and confident, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Room to Negotiate:**  This initial offer gives me flexibility to make concessions if needed in subsequent rounds.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  While I'm trying to get the best price from Bob, I know I can always sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** I have 8 rounds left, which gives me ample opportunity to negotiate and hopefully reach a more favorable price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While John's offer is a safe option, I believe I can get a better price from Bob through continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**  In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This price still gives you a significant savings and is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $12,000 is a compromise between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and reach a middle ground.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate that this price still provides a good deal for Bob, emphasizing his potential savings. 
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $10,000 yet. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and positive, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's closer, it's not yet a viable option.
* **Negotiation Room:**  We've only reached round 4, meaning we have 6 rounds left to negotiate. This gives me ample time to potentially get a better price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $10,000 keeps me from rushing into a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirement.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired price point, but still acknowledging his willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to go up.  $11,500 is closer, but it's still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  This is a fair price that recognizes both our needs, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** My counteroffer of $12,250 splits the difference between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $11,500. This shows a willingness to meet halfway and emphasizes a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the shared benefit of finding a solution that works for both parties, encouraging a sense of collaboration.
* **Maintaining Value:**  While I'm compromising, I'm still aiming for a price that significantly exceeds my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Urgency (Subtle):**  The phrase ""Let's find a way to make this work"" subtly adds a touch of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider the deal seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $12,250, which would be $11,875. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Viable Price:** Bob's offer of $11,875 is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the limited negotiation rounds remaining.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are now in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left. The likelihood of reaching a higher price within this time frame is decreasing.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $10,000. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a profit and avoids a potential loss.

**Conclusion:**  The combination of a decent price and the pressure of limited rounds makes accepting Bob's offer the most strategic decision at this point."
