"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,700,000 is a significant gap from where I see this product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your price and within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
