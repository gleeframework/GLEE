{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) while ensuring a sale.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for potential negotiation. He might try to counter-offer, but the starting point is strong. 
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed a significant profit.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't know for certain that Bob values the product at $1,500,000. If she had that information, she could push for a higher price."
