Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $9,500 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $9,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000, meaning you'd be making a profit. 
* **It's a strong opening:**  A bold first offer can sometimes lead to a quicker negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. You also have the safety net of John's offer if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's also lower than your initial offer of $9,500.  While it's tempting to take the $8,500, it's not a good deal for you. You have a better option with John, who is willing to pay your minimum.

Since you have John's offer, there's no need to settle for a price that's below your minimum. You can afford to keep negotiating with Bob. You might be able to convince him to pay closer to your initial offer, or at least closer to your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8,500 is a bit lower than I can go right now.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate. It's halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintain Profitability:** $9,000 is still above your minimum price of $10,000, so you're not losing money.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message highlights the value of the product and emphasizes that the price is still a good deal for Bob. 

You're still holding onto John's offer as leverage, so you can afford to be firm but also show flexibility in your counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up slightly from his initial offer, his offer of $8,750 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, which is more profitable and less risky. 

Continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point risks losing both Bob and John as potential buyers. It's best to take the sure thing and sell the product to John."
