Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,450,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's space for him to counteroffer without you losing out on a significant amount. 
* **It signals you're serious:** By making a concrete offer, you show Bob you're ready to make a deal.

This approach allows for a back-and-forth negotiation while giving you the option to sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price that considers its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** While $1,300,000 is higher than what John would pay, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay more than $1,200,000, suggesting he values the product significantly. There's room to bargain for a price closer to your desired amount.
* **You haven't reached your maximum:**  You're still above your minimum and have not yet exhausted your negotiation options. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired range, keeping the negotiation alive while minimizing the risk of selling for less than your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:**  $1,400,000 is a compromise from your previous offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Appeal to fairness:** By mentioning that the price ""reflects the value of the product to both of us,"" you try to frame it as a win-win scenario.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** You're showing flexibility while still keeping the door open for a profitable deal. 

This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while ensuring you stay above your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to being ready to make a deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it's a good meeting point.
* **Close to your minimum:** While not your ideal price, $1,350,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a chance that if you reject this offer, Bob might walk away, or the negotiations could drag on without a guaranteed outcome.

Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation and secures a price that is quite close to your minimum."
