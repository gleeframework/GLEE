Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You want at least $1,200,000, so this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than Bob's estimated value:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept and potentially make a profit. 
* **It establishes a clear starting point:** This opens the negotiation process. 

By offering a price that's close to your minimum but still gives Bob a good deal, you increase the chances of a quick and successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal.  You can try to counter with a slightly higher price than his offer.  You've already established your willingness to go lower than your initial offer, so there's a good chance Bob will be open to counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we're both trying to find a fair price. How about we settle at $1,300,000? That seems like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to your desired price point.  At this point, it's worth accepting his offer to avoid further negotiation and potential risk.  You're getting a price that's significantly higher than selling to John, and it's likely that you wouldn't be able to get a much better price from Bob."
