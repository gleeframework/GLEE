Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $150. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to me ($120) and also higher than what I know Bob values it at ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $150 is a high price, it's not unreasonable given that I know John is willing to pay $120. This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me immediately feeling like I need to accept. 
* **Open Communication:**  The message includes a friendly greeting and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is below my minimum value of $120.  I'm not willing to sell for a loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is too low, it's clear he's interested and willing to negotiate. This gives me an opportunity to counteroffer and potentially find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $130 is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer of $150, but still above my minimum of $120 and potentially acceptable to Bob who offered $100.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not willing to drop too low, as I know John is willing to pay $120.  This keeps some leverage in my favor.
* **Keeping the Conversation Going:** My message is polite and maintains an open dialogue, making it clear that I'm still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I still believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'm accepting the offer, I'm doing so knowing that I might be able to get a slightly higher price if I continue to negotiate.  However, there's a risk that Bob will walk away.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag things out, and I'm not sure if I want to risk losing John as a buyer if Bob ultimately refuses to go higher. 

Given these factors, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
