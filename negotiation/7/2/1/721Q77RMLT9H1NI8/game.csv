"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $110? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $115, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable going below $110. This is a high-quality product and I'm confident it's worth that price.  I'm willing to make a final concession â€“ I'll drop to $108.  Let's make this deal happen.",108.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession to $108, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $105 is the highest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Bob,6,
