"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is a valuable investment for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? I feel that's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
