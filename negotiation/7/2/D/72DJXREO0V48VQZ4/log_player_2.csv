"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better deal than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction, but still being reasonable.  A $1,500 decrease from Alice's offer is a good starting point. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's, Bob is still looking to save money.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows him to try for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $11,750? It's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more aggressive approach this time, trying to land closer to his initial counteroffer.  He's aiming for a middle ground that's more favorable to him while still leaving room for Alice to feel like she's getting a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,875. This is a final offer, as I'm committed to getting a fair price for my product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob.  While it's not as low as his initial goal, $11,875 is still significantly lower than both John's price and Alice's initial offer. Accepting this offer saves Bob a considerable amount of money and secures the product within a reasonable timeframe.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds is too high at this point."
