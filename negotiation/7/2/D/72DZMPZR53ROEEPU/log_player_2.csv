# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially setting the price at $12,000. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
