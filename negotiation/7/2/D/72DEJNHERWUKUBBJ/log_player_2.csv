"Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, you can potentially do better.  There's still room to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $7,500, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,200, which is only $200 more than my initial counteroffer of $7,000. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  Accepting her offer saves me $800 compared to buying from John."
