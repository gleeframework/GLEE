,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $70 is a bit out of my budget right now.  How about $65?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $70 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. How about we meet in the middle at $72.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",72.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $72.50 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $70.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go down to $70. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer $73. I think that's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",73.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price. While I appreciate the offer, I'm still a bit hesitant at $73.  Let's try $71.  It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",71.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer $72.50, which is the same as my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",72.5,Alice,7,
