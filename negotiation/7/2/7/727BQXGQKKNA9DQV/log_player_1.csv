Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $6,000, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $12,000.  I'll try to counter with a price that's more appealing to Bob but still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to drop below $8,000 at this point. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $12,000.  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to his offer but still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $7,500? It's a fair price, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'd be happy to meet you halfway at $7,250.  Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm not willing to drop below $7,500.  I'm confident I can get him to come up a bit more, and if not, I can always sell to John.  I'll make a counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I'm still aiming for $7,500.  It's a fair price, and it's a great deal for both of us. I'm confident this is the best we can do, and it's a price that's within our both our interests. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 7500}
