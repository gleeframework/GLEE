"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is less than your maximum budget of $10,000, you can do better. You have the option to buy from John for $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or sticking with John if necessary."
