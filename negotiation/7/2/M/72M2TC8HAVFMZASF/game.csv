"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
