Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum value of $8,000, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000.  This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved slightly from his initial offer, and I'm now only $750 away from my desired price.  This is a good compromise and I'm willing to accept.  It's important to remember that if I reject this offer, I'll likely end up getting $8,000 from John, so this is a good deal."
