Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation is helpful, it's always good to start negotiations higher than his perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to your desired amount.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value and the possibility of others being interested (""list it publicly""). 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation, keeping the conversation going.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, ensuring you don't lose out."
