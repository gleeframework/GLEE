"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, Bob's offer now matches John's guaranteed price. It's best to avoid the risk of further negotiation and secure the $1,200,000."
