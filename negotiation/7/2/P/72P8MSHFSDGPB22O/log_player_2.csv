"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Even though it's less than what you'd pay John, it's still significantly more than the product is worth to Alice ($800,000). 
* **You're better off negotiating with Alice or going with John.** Since you have a fallback option with John, you don't need to accept a price that's so far above the product's value."
