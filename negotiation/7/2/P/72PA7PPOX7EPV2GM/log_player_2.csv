"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than our outside option of buying from John for $12,000. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, aiming to bring the price closer to our target. By starting lower, we leave room for further negotiation while signaling our serious interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While I understand you're looking for a great deal, $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is closer to our ideal price, it's still above what John offers. There's a small chance we could negotiate an even better deal with Alice, so it's worth one more try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

We're inching closer to a potential deal. This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise while staying below our maximum budget and leaving some room for a final concession from either side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's still significantly less than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's final offer of $12,000 matches our outside option of buying from John.  There's no point in further negotiation. Accepting this offer gets us the product at the best possible price."
