{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) but still higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product.
* **Open to Counteroffer:** I'm not demanding a specific price, but I'm also not giving away the product for cheap. I'm willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I will analyze his counteroffer. 
* If his counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable value, I might accept. 
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll counter with a slightly lower price, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I can try to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.  If I accept, I'll be selling for less than my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if there's a middle ground we can reach. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll need to assess whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While I understand you're looking for a great deal, $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $12,500 is exactly halfway between my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product, making it clear that this price is still a good deal for him. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and open to further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I've secured a decent deal.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll have to consider my options: 
    *  If he makes a counteroffer closer to $12,500, I might accept. 
    * If his counteroffer is still significantly lower, I'll seriously consider selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Close to John's Offer:**  While it's tempting to accept, John is offering $15,000, which is a significantly better deal. 
* **Potential for Improvement:** There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially secure a price closer to my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will seriously consider selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's still significantly less than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $12,000 is halfway between my previous offer ($12,500) and Bob's current offer ($11,500).  
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still significantly less than what I could get elsewhere, making it a good deal for Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using friendly language and focusing on finding a mutually agreeable solution. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I've secured a deal that's closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Selling to John:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll likely sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high at this point, as it's unlikely he will come up to my desired price."
