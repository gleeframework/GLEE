"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,550,000 is still a bit high. How about we split the difference and go with $1,400,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit short of what I need. Let's meet in the middle at $1,450,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here.  Let's make this final offer - $1,425,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal that we can both agree on.  What do you say?",1425000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to close this deal, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $1,425,000 is still just a bit below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle one last time at $1,475,000.  This is the best I can do, and it's a fair price for both of us. If we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
