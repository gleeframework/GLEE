"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
