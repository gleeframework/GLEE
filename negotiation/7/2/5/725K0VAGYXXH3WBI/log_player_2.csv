"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the potential sale with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is closer to her own valuation than yours. There's room for negotiation.  You can do better by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  Could you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting your maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
