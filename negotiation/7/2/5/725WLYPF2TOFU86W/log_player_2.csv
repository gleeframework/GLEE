"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept an offer that's only a little over half of your maximum budget. Let's see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850000 is a bit steep for you, but $600000 is quite a stretch from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $750000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price before considering that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $675,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both find a win in this deal."", ""product_price"": 675000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, $675000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you a price of $725000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and $725,000 is within my budget.  It's time to take the deal.  I'm sure I can still make a decent profit at this price."
