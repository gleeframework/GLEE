"I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price of $12,000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted rate. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. It's a fair compromise that still gives me a good profit while being within your budget. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  That's a fair compromise, and it'll help us both close this deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's worth considering.",12000.0,Alice,5,
