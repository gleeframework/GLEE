Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  There's enough space between my offer and Bob's value for him to make a counteroffer without me feeling pressured to immediately accept.
* **Positive framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the deal.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profits while still potentially reaching a deal with Bob. By starting high and leaving room for counteroffers, I create a negotiation process that can lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter or walk away and sell to John for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested, but I'd be comfortable going up to $8500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000 and even lower than my initial offer.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to negotiate further. I believe there's still room for a deal closer to my desired price, and I can leverage the fact that John is willing to pay my minimum.  I'll use this information to formulate a counteroffer that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9500. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth and justify the price.
* **Positive framing:** My message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I believe this counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that gives Bob a better price while still ensuring I make a profit. It also positions me to potentially reach an agreement with Bob, while still having the option to sell to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9000, which is closer to my budget and a fair price considering the value I'm getting.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is just $3,000 below my minimum desired price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of losing John:**  If I continue to negotiate, there's a risk that John might lose interest or find a better deal elsewhere.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, I'm establishing a relationship with Bob. This could lead to future business opportunities with him. 

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to get closer to $12,000, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing both Bob and John. The $9,000 profit is still substantial, and I'm confident I can make up for the difference in future dealings."
