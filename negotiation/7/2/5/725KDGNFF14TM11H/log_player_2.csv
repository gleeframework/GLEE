You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9500. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is closer to his target, it's still above his maximum budget.  He can still try to negotiate further with Alice, or he can buy from John for $8,000."
