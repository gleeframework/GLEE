"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested, but I'd be comfortable going up to $8500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9500. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9000, which is closer to my budget and a fair price considering the value I'm getting.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
