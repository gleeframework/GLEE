Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm setting the price at $11,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob first allows you to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,000 is a significant savings for Bob compared to the product's worth to him ($8,000). This makes the offer enticing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob could counter-offer, and you have some buffer to still get a better price than John offers.
* **Confident Tone:**  By mentioning ""demand"" and not starting too low, you present the product as valuable and desirable.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming to get the best possible price from Bob without completely losing him as a buyer."
