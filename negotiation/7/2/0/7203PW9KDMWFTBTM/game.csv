"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated for the true value of this product. I'm offering you the product for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
