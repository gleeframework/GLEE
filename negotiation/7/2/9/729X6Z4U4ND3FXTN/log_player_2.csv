"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay. It's better to reject and see if Alice will come down further.  There's also the option of buying from John at a lower price, so Bob has leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to establish a lower price point. He's offering $950,000, which is still a substantial amount for Alice, but it's well within Bob's budget and signals a serious intent to negotiate. This move allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially reach an agreement within his price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob is trying to keep the price as low as possible. Buying from John is a viable option if Alice doesn't come down further. By rejecting, Bob can continue to try and drive the price down and see if Alice will be willing to make another concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering the same price as John,  $1,000,000.  This makes Alice's offer less appealing.  This counteroffer puts the ball firmly in Alice's court and forces her to decide if she wants to accept Bob's offer or risk losing the deal entirely.  This strategy plays on Alice's desire to sell and puts the pressure on her to make a final decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit further, but it's still more than Bob's ideal price.  Bob is willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if he can push the price down further.  It is still more advantageous to continue negotiating than to purchase from John at this moment. If Alice's next offer is not satisfactory, then Bob can always buy from John.  The option of buying from John provides Bob with a valuable bargaining chip."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1010000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small counteroffer, increasing his bid to $1,010,000. This shows Alice he's willing to pay slightly more, but is still pushing for a lower price. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal quickly before the number of rounds runs out.  By staying close to the $1,000,000 price point, Bob maintains the option of purchasing from John if Alice doesn't accept. This strategy allows Bob to maintain leverage while demonstrating his willingness to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $15,000 higher than Bob's ideal price. With only three rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves time.  While he could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob might end up buying from John at the same price. Accepting Alice's offer represents a reasonable compromise and secures the product."
