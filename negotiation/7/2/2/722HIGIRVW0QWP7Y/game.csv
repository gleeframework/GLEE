"I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This product truly provides significant value, and I believe that's a fair price.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
