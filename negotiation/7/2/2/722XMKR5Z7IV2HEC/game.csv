"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's split the difference and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe we can finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
