Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).** This ensures you make a profit.
* **Is below Bob's maximum value ($1,200,000).** This gives Bob room to negotiate and increases the likelihood of a deal.

By starting in the middle, you create space for negotiation and increase the chances of a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000), but it's closer to your minimum than you'd like.**  You want to maximize your profit.
* **Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and potentially get closer to $1,000,000.**  You're still in a strong position because you have the option to sell to John if the negotiation fails.
* **This tactic keeps Bob engaged and creates a dynamic negotiation.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

* **This counteroffer keeps the momentum going and increases the likelihood of a successful deal.**"
