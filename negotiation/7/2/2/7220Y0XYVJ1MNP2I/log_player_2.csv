"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can do better than $1,000,000.  By rejecting, he opens the door for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice and he's willing to pay up to $1,200,000.  A counteroffer of $900,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. He can save $250,000 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to accept the current offer and secure a good deal."
