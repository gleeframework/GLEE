Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it, considering its potential value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $750000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $750000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $700000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $725000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
