"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $16500 is closer to my budget, I still feel that we can find a price that works for both of us. Could you consider $15000 as a fair offer for the product?",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I've already gone as low as I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16000. This is my final offer.
