"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire for a fair deal, and I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,280,000? This represents a significant investment on your part, but I'm confident the product's value will more than justify it in the long run.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,280,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,230,000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",1230000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and recognize you're serious about this purchase. Let's find a solution we can both agree on. How about we make it a clean $1,255,000? This reflects my desire to close this deal and acknowledges the significant value you see in the product.",1255000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your desire to close the deal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1,225,000. I believe this is the best compromise considering the value and potential of the product.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
