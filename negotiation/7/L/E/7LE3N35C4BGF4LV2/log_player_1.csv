Round 2
Bob's offer:

{

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,280,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,230,000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently coming up in his offers, indicating a strong desire for the product. We're still significantly above John's offer, and with 5 rounds remaining, there's room to negotiate further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and recognize you're serious about this purchase. Let's find a solution we can both agree on. How about we make it a clean $1,255,000? This reflects my desire to close this deal and acknowledges the significant value you see in the product."",
""product_price"": 1255000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference:** It shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong position above $1,250,000.
* **Uses a strong but fair tone:** The message acknowledges Bob's commitment while emphasizing the product's value.
* **Creates urgency:** By making it a ""clean"" number, it suggests this is a final offer and encourages Bob to accept."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to close the deal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1,225,000. I believe this is the best compromise considering the value and potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the risk of Bob walking away increases. 
* **Bob's offer is reasonable:**  $1,225,000 is a significant amount, and while higher offers might be possible, they come with increased risk.  
* **A sure thing is better:** Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit over John's standing offer. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely by pushing for a slightly higher price."
