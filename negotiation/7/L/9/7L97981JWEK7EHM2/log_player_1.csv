{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm pricing the product at $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation, and it also signals that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob.  I'll be ready to counter any offers Bob makes, but I also have the option to sell to John for $150 if I feel the negotiation isn't going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I believe there's still room for a slightly higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we meet at $135? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $132.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $132.50 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's still a better deal for me than selling to John for $150. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
