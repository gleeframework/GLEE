"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($10,000). Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000. This is still a great price for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $15,000.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, there is no guarantee Bob will get a lower price and it risks losing the deal altogether."
