"Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, just as it has been to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1,900,000. What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,900,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,400,000 is still lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to accept $1,550,000.  This offer stands for 24 hours.  Let me know your decision.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,550,000 is closer to my target,  I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,500,000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
