"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $11000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10250. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. ",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to split the difference, but $10250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $9800 is tempting, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $10000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward from there. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,5,
