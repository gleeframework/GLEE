"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value the product offers you.  Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but $11,250 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $12,000?  This is a really fair price, considering the value the product provides for you.  Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
