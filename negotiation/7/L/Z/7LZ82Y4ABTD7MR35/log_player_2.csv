"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is higher than John's price. There is room for negotiation to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) to see how much negotiating room there is. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a positive tone, expressing interest in the product while clearly stating my price limit. 

This strategy aims to:
* **Maximize Savings:**  My goal is to buy the product for the lowest possible price, ideally closer to John's $12,000 offer.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help understand if Alice is open to negotiating a price closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value the product offers you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but there's still room for improvement. By rejecting this offer, I can:

1. **Signal Flexibility:**  While I rejected her last offer, countering again shows I'm still interested and willing to negotiate.
2. **Aim Closer to $12,000:**  I can try for a counteroffer closer to John's price, aiming for the best possible deal.
3. **Maintain the Option of John:** I haven't committed to Alice yet, so buying from John at $12,000 remains my fallback plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?"",
""product_price"": 11250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $11,250, I'm proposing a compromise that's exactly halfway between her current offer ($12,500) and my previous one ($10,000). 
* **Staying Above John's Price:**  My counteroffer remains higher than John's $12,000, giving Alice an incentive to potentially accept and still make a sale.
* **Signaling Seriousness:** Suggesting a middle ground shows I'm serious about negotiating a fair price and encourages Alice to do the same."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close, but $11,250 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $12,000?  This is a really fair price, considering the value the product provides for you.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my target price of $12,000, which is the same as John's offer. There's no point in further negotiation or going with John since the price is now identical. It's time to accept and secure the deal with Alice."
