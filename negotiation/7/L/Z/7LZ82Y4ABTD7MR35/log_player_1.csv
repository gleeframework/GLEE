Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  It gives him a sense of getting a good deal.
* **Lower than your minimum:** It leaves room for negotiation without compromising your minimum price.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more substantial offer. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value the product offers you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, $11,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but $11,250 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $12,000?  This is a really fair price, considering the value the product provides for you.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
