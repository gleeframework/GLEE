Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product at a price of $11,999. I think you'll find this price very competitive given its value.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above your minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired minimum price."
