Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $80, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Profit:** The $120 offer allows for a potential $40 profit over Bob's perceived value. 
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Polite and Encouraging:** The message is framed positively, focusing on the product's value to Bob and encouraging him to consider the offer."
