"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this right away. I want to gauge his interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to my $1,000,000 valuation by continuing negotiations. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will lead to a quicker agreement without risking too much."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. It's only round 4, and I have time to negotiate further. I'm confident I can squeeze out another $50,000 from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It's only $50,000 away from my bottom line, so I'm hoping to secure a deal in this round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my target, we're still $25,000 apart.  We have several rounds left, and I'm optimistic I can get a better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,025,000. It's just $25,000 above Bob's last offer, and closer to my goal. If he rejects this, I'll move on to John."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my desired price, we're now in round 8 and I'm only $10,000 away from John's offer. The risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing outweighs the potential gain of a few more thousand dollars. It's time to take the guaranteed profit."
