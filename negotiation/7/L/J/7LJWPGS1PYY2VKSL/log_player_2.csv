Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer."
