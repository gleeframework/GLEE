Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet somewhere in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we try $1,000,000? That's a significant investment on my end but reflects a fair price for both of us."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to a fair price, I can't accept that low of an offer.  Would you consider $1,250,000? I'm confident this product will more than pay for itself, and this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is firm on her price and unlikely to go much lower. It's clear she won't accept anything below $1,250,000. Since you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, it's more advantageous to cut your losses and buy from John."
