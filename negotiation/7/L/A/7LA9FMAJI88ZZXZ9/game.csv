"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me in the middle?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? That's still a great deal for you considering the value you placed on it.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Can we try $87.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $88.50? This is my final offer.",88.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $88.50. I'm willing to go up to $86.25. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",86.25,Bob,6,
