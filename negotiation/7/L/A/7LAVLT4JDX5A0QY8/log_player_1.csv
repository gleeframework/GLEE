Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I'm going to start with my desired price. This gives me the best chance of getting my full value for the product, and if Bob isn't willing to pay that, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."

I'm offering Bob a price of $11,000. This is a compromise that is halfway between my desired price and his offer, and I hope it will be enough to entice him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.  While I could sell to John, there's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering Bob a price of $11,500.  This is another compromise that moves closer to my desired price. I'm hoping that this offer will be enough to close the deal.  It's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but I'm still willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough to justify further negotiation.  Rather than continuing to haggle with Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation failing."
