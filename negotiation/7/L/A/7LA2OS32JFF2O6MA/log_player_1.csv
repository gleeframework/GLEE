"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my ideal price.  $85 is a bit low, but I don't want to lose the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $90? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can find a compromise there."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to $90, $87.50 is a decent price and it's getting too risky to keep pushing. I don't want to lose Bob as a buyer and end up selling to John for less."
