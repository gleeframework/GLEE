"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll counter with $13750. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13750.0,Alice,5,
