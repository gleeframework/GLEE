"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $1,600,000. This would still allow me to make a profit and is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
