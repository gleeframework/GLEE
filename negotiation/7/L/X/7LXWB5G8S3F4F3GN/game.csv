"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, Alice, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $950,000? That's a substantial sum.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I need to be transparent: I have another buyer ready to close the deal at a price closer to my asking price. I'm willing to give you one final opportunity to meet a figure of $1,025,000. This offer stands for the next 24 hours, after which I'll need to move forward with the other buyer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
