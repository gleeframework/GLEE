Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so don't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $400,000 surplus to negotiate over.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. 

**Strategy**

Aim high, but be realistic.  Bob is more likely to accept an offer that feels like a good deal to him too.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Considering its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair for both of us. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Justifiable:** $1,100,000 secures you a significant portion of the potential surplus ($300,000 more than John).
* **Time Limit:**  The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Notes**

* **Be Confident:**  Believe in your product's value when negotiating with Bob.
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob counters with an offer too low, politely decline and proceed with John. You have a strong fallback option."
