{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still below your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters, and you're still likely to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $85? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already had a couple of rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely that Bob is willing to meet my price.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $120 to guarantee a good profit."
