Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is well above your $80 minimum, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $120 is below Bob's estimated value of $150, making it attractive for him.
* **It shows confidence:**  Offering a firm price right away shows that you believe in the value of your product. 

We'll see how Bob reacts and adjust our strategy based on his response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still below our desired profit margin. We have a good chance of getting closer to our target price by counter-offering.  We can use Bob's willingness to pay $100 as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and you'll still be getting a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Appealing to logic:** We're framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Emphasis on value:** We're reminding Bob of the product's worth, justifying the price."
