"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $700,000.  It's a fair price that leaves some room for both of us to profit."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's opening offer, aiming to:

* **Establish a strong starting point:** By aiming low, we leave room for negotiation and signal that we're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  Her response will indicate how eager she is to sell and how close to her value we might need to get. 

It's a calculated risk, but with John as a backup, we have some leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, claiming $850,000 is her ""final offer"" at this stage is likely a negotiating tactic. We still have rounds to go, and she's likely more motivated to sell than we are to buy (given John's offer). Rejecting keeps the negotiation alive and gives us the opportunity to inch closer to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $750,000? This offer keeps us both moving in the right direction."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  We're showing a willingness to negotiate by increasing our offer, but only by $50,000. 
* **Maintaining pressure:** We're still well below her ""final offer,"" signaling we're serious about getting a better price.
* **Neutral tone:**  The message aims for a collaborative tone rather than confrontational, keeping the negotiation on track. 

We're essentially testing her resolve at this stage. If she's truly unwilling to budge from $850,000, we can consider our options in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $750,000 is still not in my best interest.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000.  This offer is fair and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met us at her product's true value of $800,000. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, especially considering she might interpret further negotiation as an attempt to lowball her.  

This price point represents a good deal for us, saving $200,000 compared to John's offer.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
