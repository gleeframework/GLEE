"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $700,000.  It's a fair price that leaves some room for both of us to profit.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.  Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $750,000? This offer keeps us both moving in the right direction.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $750,000 is still not in my best interest.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000.  This offer is fair and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
