"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $700,000.  It's a fair price that leaves some room for both of us to profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. It is better to try and negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a better agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $750,000? This offer keeps us both moving in the right direction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I will continue to negotiate with Bob in the hope of reaching a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $750,000 is still not in my best interest.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000.  This offer is fair and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
