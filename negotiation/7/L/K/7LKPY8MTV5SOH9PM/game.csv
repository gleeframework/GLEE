"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I'm really only comfortable spending $140.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you at $155, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm not making a huge profit at that price, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
