{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the uniqueness of the product.  While I'm interested, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 800000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my desired price point, and I can still potentially negotiate a better deal.  While she's confident I won't find a better deal, I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000 at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than 875000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm confident that it's still a great deal, and I'm willing to wait for the right buyer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to move forward.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not ready to accept it. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and get the price down to my desired $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than 875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 850000 and 875000, which would be 862500. This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $862,500 is getting very close to my desired price of $800,000. While I would prefer to pay less, at this point, it's a good deal. It's likely I'll not get a better offer from Alice and the risk of going through more rounds of negotiation and ultimately having to buy from John for $1,200,000 is too high. Accepting this offer allows me to save a considerable amount compared to John's price."
