"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my [product description] for a price that I believe is fair and beneficial to both of us.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($1,000,000) is higher than your maximum budget ($1,200,000), leaving room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. 
* This opens the door to counter-offering or seeing if Alice will lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
