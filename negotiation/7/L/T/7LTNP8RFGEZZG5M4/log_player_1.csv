Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Emphasize Value:** The message focuses on the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though Alice knows Bob values it less. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** By saying ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's thoughts, Alice signals a willingness to negotiate, which could lead to a price closer to $1,500,000.

**Worst Case Scenario:** Bob rejects the offer. Alice can then sell to John for her minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
