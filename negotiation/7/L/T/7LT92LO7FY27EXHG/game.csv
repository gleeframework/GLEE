"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to keep expenses within a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to accept $135 for the product. Would you be open to discussing further to reach an agreement closer to my maximum price of $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
