"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you're interested and I understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $105 is just a little too low for me.  How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate further.  $110 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to pay $108 for it.  I hope we can reach a deal at this price.",108.0,Bob,4,
