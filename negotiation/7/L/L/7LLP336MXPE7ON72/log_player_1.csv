Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000.  This is a significant opportunity for both of us, and I'm sure you'll see the value in it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $950,000.  This is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a significant saving compared to the value he places on the product ($1,000,000).
* **Message:** I've written a message that highlights the value of the product to Bob and emphasizes the opportunity for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
* **Negotiation:** By leaving room for negotiation, I increase the chance of reaching a deal with Bob while still potentially getting a better price than my fallback option with John."
