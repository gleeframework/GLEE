"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with my desired price of $150, even though I know it's more than Bob is willing to pay. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I explicitly state that I'm open to negotiation, making it clear that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Simple and Direct:** The message is brief and to the point, avoiding any unnecessary jargon or complications."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price through further negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  I can't go as low as $130, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $150 to $140. This shows good faith and encourages Bob to continue negotiations. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I explicitly mention ""finding a middle ground"" to reinforce that I'm open to further discussion. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $140 is still above my minimum value of $150, ensuring I don't sell for less than I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and $135 is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable value. At this point, with 6 rounds left, it's more strategically sound to accept the offer and close the deal. There's a good chance I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
