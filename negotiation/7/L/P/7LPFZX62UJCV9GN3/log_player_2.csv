"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I believe this product will be a significant asset to your endeavors. Please consider this offer carefully.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is your maximum budget. While it's a fair offer, you have no leverage to negotiate a lower price. John is also selling the same product for $1,000,000, providing an alternative. 

Since both options have the same price, you might as well buy from John. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer in this scenario."
