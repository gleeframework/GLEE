"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows me to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $110 to make it worth my while. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $110 is within my budget. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate."
