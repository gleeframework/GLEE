This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above your minimum but leaves room for bargaining.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $120 for this purchase. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is above your minimum, it's still a good deal for Bob. You want to see if you can push for a higher price.  You'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $120 is tempting, I'd need to go a bit higher. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that you're still willing to negotiate, Alice. Thank you for being flexible. I would like to propose a price of $120, which is my maximum budget for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob has come back to his original offer of $120. While you'd prefer a higher price, it's still above your minimum of $100, and you risk losing the sale to John by continuing to negotiate."
