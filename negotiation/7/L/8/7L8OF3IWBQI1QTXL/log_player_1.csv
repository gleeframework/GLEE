"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a relatively high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates my confidence in the value of the product.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for a high initial offer to gauge his interest and potentially secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. I have 8 rounds left and can still sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000,  leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can potentially get a better price. It's worth risking one more round to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired range.  If I don't see progress, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $11,000.  This is a further concession, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. It's also closer to Bob's last offer and  I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. We're now only $2,000 apart, so there's a good chance Bob might accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only 4 rounds left, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000.  While $9,500 is a better price than my initial minimum, I'm not convinced I can push Bob higher in the remaining rounds. I've already made significant concessions, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirement, and it's safer than risking a potential stalemate with Bob."
