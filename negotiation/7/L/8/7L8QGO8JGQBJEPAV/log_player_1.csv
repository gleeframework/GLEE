Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price of $10,000. 

By starting with a strong but not overly aggressive offer, Alice increases her chances of closing a deal with Bob at a price that's favorable to both parties."
