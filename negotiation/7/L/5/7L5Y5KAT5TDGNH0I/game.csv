"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, though. How about $125? Let's make this happen.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant at $125. Would you be willing to go down to $115?,115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $115 is really too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.  How about $120? That's my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I'm willing to go back up to $120. I was really hoping to get it for under $120. Would you be willing to consider $118?,118.0,Bob,6,
