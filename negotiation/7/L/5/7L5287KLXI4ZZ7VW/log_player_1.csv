Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,199,999. I believe it holds significant value and could be highly beneficial for you."", ""product_price"": 1199999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible without him rejecting the offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a strong safety net.
* **High but Acceptable:** Offering the product at $1,199,999 is a high price, but it's still slightly below Bob's $1,200,000 valuation. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring a sale, even if Bob ultimately rejects the offer."
