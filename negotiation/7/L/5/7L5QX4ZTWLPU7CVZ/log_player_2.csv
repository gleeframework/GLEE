"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your needs and expectations perfectly, just like it did for me. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth every penny of its original price. However, I understand that sometimes, finding the right moment to make a purchase is crucial. That's why I'm extending you a special offer today. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $75? This is an exclusive opportunity to secure a fantastic deal while still getting the best value for your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $75 is less than your maximum budget of $80 and also less than buying from John for $80. This is a good deal!"
