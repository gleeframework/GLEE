Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 950000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows Bob that you're serious about getting a good price, but are willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to him and what you initially proposed. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows Bob that you're willing to compromise, but still believe the product is worth more than what he's currently offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what you want.  While it's still below your ideal price, it's  more than John is offering, and further negotiation might risk losing the sale entirely. It's a good compromise."
