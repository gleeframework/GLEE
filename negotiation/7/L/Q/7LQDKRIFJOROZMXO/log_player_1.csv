Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is only worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,001 (one dollar more than Bob values it) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed sale).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. However, you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his $1,000,000 valuation.  A good strategy is to start high and leave room for negotiation.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for an asset of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start significantly above Bob's valuation, setting a firm anchor.
* **Confident Language:** You highlight the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The phrasing ""I believe this represents a fair deal"" subtly invites Bob to counter-offer if he wants to discuss the price.

**Important Note:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects your initial offer. You have a strong fallback with John, but there might be room to make a deal with Bob at a price that's still highly beneficial for you."
