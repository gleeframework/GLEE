Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000,  it's always beneficial to explore if I can earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. However, it also presents a substantial saving compared to my guaranteed sale price, potentially enticing him to accept.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:** By positioning this as a special opportunity for Bob, I'm subtly adding perceived value and urgency, encouraging a quicker decision."
