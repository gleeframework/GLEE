"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. It's a good middle ground between my minimum acceptable price of $80 and Bob's estimated value of $100.  This should open the negotiation and hopefully lead to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'm going to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. It's a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will lead to a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, it's not worth risking another round and potentially losing the deal altogether."
