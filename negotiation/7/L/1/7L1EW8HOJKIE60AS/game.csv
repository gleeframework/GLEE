"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000 to find a middle ground. This offer reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still more than I had in mind. To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for a significantly lower price.  If you're able to consider an offer closer to $10,000, I'm very interested. Otherwise, I may have to go with the other option.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued conversation. I understand your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I did aim for a higher price initially, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my final offer, as it's a significant reduction and reflects the true value you'll receive.",14000.0,Alice,5,
