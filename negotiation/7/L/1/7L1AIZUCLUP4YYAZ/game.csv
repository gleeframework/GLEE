"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I'd get from another buyer, and still leaves you a good profit margin.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $12,500 to make this worthwhile. How about $12,750? This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to cover my costs.",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $12,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,750, which would be $12,375. Would you be willing to accept this price?",12375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,375 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway *again*,  but I need to stay at least at $12,562.50 to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and go with that price? ",12562.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget of $12,000. I'm willing to accept the product at this price. Can you meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
