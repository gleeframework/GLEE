Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Potential Profit:** The offered price of $175 allows for a $25 profit margin if Bob accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Since you have John as a backup buyer at $150, you can afford to be a bit bolder with your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee that Bob will accept this offer. You could potentially start with a lower offer closer to $150 to increase the chances of a quick sale. However, starting higher allows for more negotiation room."
