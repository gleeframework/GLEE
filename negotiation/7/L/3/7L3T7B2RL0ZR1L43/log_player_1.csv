Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $140. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $140 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $120 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to accept a low price from Bob."
