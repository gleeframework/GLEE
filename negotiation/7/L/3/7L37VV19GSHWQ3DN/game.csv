"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This represents a significant discount and is a good starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation and offering a starting point. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession on my part, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This represents a considerable price difference from my initial counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we are making progress and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000 for the product. This offer takes into account the value it brings while recognizing your investment.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in this round.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
