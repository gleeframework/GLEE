Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $11000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
