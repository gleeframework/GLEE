"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You are looking to save money, and Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $9500 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  Since John is selling the product for $10,000, it's more beneficial to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
