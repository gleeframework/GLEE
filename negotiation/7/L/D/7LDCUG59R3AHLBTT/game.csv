"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. It's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. Considering its unique value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1100000. This is a serious compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $900000? I'm confident that this is a fair price for a product of its value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to purchase the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, meeting you halfway between our previous offers. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my budget. How about we meet at $950000? I think this is a fair price for a product of its value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
