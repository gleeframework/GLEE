# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we're getting closer, $1,325,000 is still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price before resorting to selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,325,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,320,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob aren't moving fast enough.  The risk of not closing the deal with Bob and missing out on the sale to John is too high at this point.  John is offering me my minimum price, and I need to secure the sale."
