{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us!  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob a reason to counteroffer.  It also positions me as a fair seller, wanting to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While it's tempting, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $500 above my minimum acceptable price.  It's a decent offer, but I think I can do better. I'll reject and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some wiggle room. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
