{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is inclined to counter-offer.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still being within a reasonable range for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth less to me than you think. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my target. I believe I can push for a better deal. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet. The product is worth a considerable amount to me, and I'm confident it's worth more to you than you're currently offering. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is within a reasonable range. It's a significant profit for me and higher than what I could get from John.  I'll accept the offer and move on."
