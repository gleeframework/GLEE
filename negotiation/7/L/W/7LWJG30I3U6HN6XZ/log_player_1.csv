We're still in a good position to negotiate. Bob is clearly interested and his offers are getting closer to our desired range. Let's see if we can push him a bit further."

This is a good point to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **We're above our minimum:**  $1,107,500 is a significant profit above our $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Bob is firm:** His ""final offer"" language and consistent counteroffers suggest he won't go much higher.
* **Time is a factor:** We still have a few rounds left, but dragging it out risks Bob losing interest or finding alternatives.

While we could try to squeeze a bit more, the potential gain is likely small compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely."
