"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $600,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit, and $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're serious about making a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go below $875,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer for $800,000."
