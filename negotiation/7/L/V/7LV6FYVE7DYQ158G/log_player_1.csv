Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and keeping the possibility of a sale to Bob open. Here's why:

* **It's a good deal for Bob:** He can buy the product for $14,000, which is $4,000 less than its worth to him. 
* **It's a good deal for you:** You make $1,000 less than selling to John, but there's a chance you can sell it to Bob. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob is willing to pay more, you can potentially increase the price.
