Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we want to start with a higher offer to see if we can secure a better deal. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** An initial offer of $18,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price higher than $15,000. 
* **Alternative Option:** We have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, acting as a safety net. This allows us to be more assertive in our negotiation with Bob.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. We need to be prepared to adjust our price based on Bob's reaction and potential counter-offers."
