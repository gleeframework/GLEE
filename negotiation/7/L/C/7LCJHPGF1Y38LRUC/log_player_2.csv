Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This still gives you a great value and ensures I get a fair price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to find common ground.  While I appreciate you coming up to $8,800, I'm really not willing to go lower than $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for well below what it's worth to me.  Let's see if we can agree on this price and finalize the deal.
