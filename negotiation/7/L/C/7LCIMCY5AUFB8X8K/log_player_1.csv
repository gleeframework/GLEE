Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand the product's value may seem a bit high at first glance, but I assure you it's worth the investment.  How about we settle on $17,000? That's a significant price drop and a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $11,000? I think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price point that makes sense for me. It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum in the remaining rounds, so it's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer."
