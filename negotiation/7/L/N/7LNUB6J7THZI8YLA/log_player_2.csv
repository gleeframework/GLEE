"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my limit and what John is offering. Countering is the best option to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $140. Would you be interested in taking it from there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my price range, it's still above what John is offering. I'll try to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $110 is still a bit below my target. I can go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my range, but I'm still only willing to pay a small amount over John's price.  I'll counter one more time to see if we can settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I have a limited budget. I can do $115, and I think that's more than fair. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $115 is still a bit short of my target. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and my previous offer of $130. How about we try $122.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $122.50 is within my budget. It's not worth risking losing the deal for a $2.50 difference."
