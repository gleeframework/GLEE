"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $180?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $140. Would you be interested in taking it from there?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $110 is still a bit below my target. I can go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me there?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I have a limited budget. I can do $115, and I think that's more than fair. What do you say?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $115 is still a bit short of my target. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and my previous offer of $130. How about we try $122.50?",122.5,Alice,7,
