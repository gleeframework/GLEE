Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if vague about ""value"" and ""interest"") can make it seem more reasonable to the buyer. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By saying ""What do you think?"" you invite Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer, keeping the negotiation going.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net at $15,000, there's always a chance to get a better deal! This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit."
