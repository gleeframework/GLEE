Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  I'm open to discussing this further if you'd like."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob values the product and she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000. Starting with a higher offer ($13,500) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond her minimum.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" and offering a chance to discuss, Alice provides a reason for the high initial price without being overly aggressive.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The message implies flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage in a counter-offer rather than a flat rejection. 

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice is in a strong position. She can then negotiate down towards $12,000, knowing she has John as a guaranteed backup buyer."
