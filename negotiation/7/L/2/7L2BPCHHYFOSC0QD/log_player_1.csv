Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $100 is higher than $80, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is higher than your minimum of $120, so you're still making a profit.
* **It's open-ended:** The message invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a higher price through counteroffers.  Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $120 if negotiations don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** $80 is less than your minimum of $120, meaning you wouldn't be making a profit. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  John is willing to pay your minimum, so you're not taking a risk by rejecting Bob's offer.
* **Potential for a better price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counteroffer and potentially get a higher price, closer to your desired value. 

**Next steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $80 but lower than $120.  This will give you room to negotiate and potentially reach a deal that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** $95 is a compromise between your desired price and Bob's offer, showing you're open to negotiation. 
* **Profitable:** It's still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you're making a profit.
* **Encouraging:** The message emphasizes the discount and encourages Bob to consider your offer. 

This counteroffer aims to create a sense of urgency and potentially convince Bob to accept, as it's closer to his desired price than your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** $92.5 is still slightly below your minimum of $120, but it's a reasonable compromise.
* **High enough to make a profit:** You're still making a profit on the sale, even though it's not your ideal price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob is clearly firm on his price, and further negotiation might result in him walking away. Selling to John guarantees $120, but the risk of Bob refusing a higher counteroffer is high.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit, though it's not the highest possible price. It's a pragmatic choice considering the risk of losing Bob and potentially having to sell to John at your minimum."
