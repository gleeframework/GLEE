"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product that's truly one of a kind. I believe its value is significant, and I'm starting with a price of $1800000.

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $600000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value of similar products. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than my initial expectation, I'm willing to negotiate.  I understand your budget constraints, but $600000 is simply too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price still reflects the product's unique features and potential. Let's see if we can reach a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750000, as I believe this reflects a fair compromise.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $750000 is closer to my expectation, it's still significantly below what I need to consider. Given the product's unique value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price is fair and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
