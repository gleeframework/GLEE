"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $125. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is a good price, you can potentially get it for less.  By rejecting the offer, you can start a negotiation and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $100 on this product. Would you be willing to go down to $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $115?  That's a fair price considering what this product is worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is still a good deal for you. You're getting the product for less than your maximum price of $150, and it's likely you won't be able to negotiate her down further."
