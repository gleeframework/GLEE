"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $120 is above your maximum budget of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try to get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Alice with a price closer to your budget in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While $110 is better than $120, it's still above my comfort zone.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have more rounds to try to get a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my target, hopefully getting closer to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I can offer it to you for $108. It's a small step up from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting close:** $108 is very close to my counteroffer of $105, and well within my budget of $150.
* **Time is ticking:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

I'm happy to accept this offer and buy the product from Alice."
