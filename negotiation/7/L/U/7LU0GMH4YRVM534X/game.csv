"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to close this deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I still feel that $11,500 is slightly above my budget. I would like to propose $10,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think this deal isn't going to work out. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $11,000.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options.  Let me know your decision.",11000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm sorry to hear that, Alice. I've done some research and found that John is willing to sell the product to me for $8,000. Considering that, I believe $10,750 is the most I can reasonably offer for your product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,8,
