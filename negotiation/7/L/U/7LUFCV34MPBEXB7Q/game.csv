"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to us, we're considering a starting price of $10,000. This is well above your perceived value but still below our cost. We're open to negotiation to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the negotiation, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This represents a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering our product's value and your interest, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to our initial price. My counteroffer is $9,500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your response. I understand your position and am willing to move forward with a price of $9,250 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our values. I hope this aligns with your expectations.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  However, $9,250 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  To close the deal, I'm willing to go to $9,000. This would allow us to finalize the transaction and give me a reasonable price. Let's make it happen!",9000.0,Bob,6,
