"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional item, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1800000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1200000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell it to you for $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
