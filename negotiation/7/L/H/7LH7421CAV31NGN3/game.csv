"Bob, while I understand your budget constraints, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to get a good price for the product, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
