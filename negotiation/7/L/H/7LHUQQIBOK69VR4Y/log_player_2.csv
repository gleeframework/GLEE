"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your acceptable range. If not, you're still securing a better deal with John."
