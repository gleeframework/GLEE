Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,400,000 offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob attempts to haggle.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line, aiming to persuade Bob that the price is justified.

**Goal:** The objective is to maximize profit. While you have a safety net with John, securing a deal with Bob at a price above your minimum ensures you capitalize on the potential surplus."
