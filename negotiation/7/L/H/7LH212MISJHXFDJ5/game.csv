"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $85? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $80? That's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'm going to have to move on to other buyers.",80.0,Alice,5,
