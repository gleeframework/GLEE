"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is a good price**, but there's room for negotiation, especially since you have multiple rounds. 
* **You want to save as much money as possible.** 
* **Rejection allows for counteroffers**, giving you more control over the final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  A significant drop from $90 to $75 shows you're serious about getting a good deal and encourages Alice to negotiate.
* **Within Your Budget:** $75 is comfortably within your $150 limit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will give you insight into how much Alice is willing to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:** It's significantly lower than her initial price of $90 and closer to your counteroffer of $75.
* **Time is a factor:**  You've already had one round of negotiation, and the risk of further negotiation might lead to a higher price or running out of rounds. 
* **Buying from John is too expensive:** $150 is far beyond your desired budget, and Alice's offer is within your limit.
* **Secure the deal:**  Accepting at $85 secures you a good deal while ensuring you don't risk losing out on a product you want."
