"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
