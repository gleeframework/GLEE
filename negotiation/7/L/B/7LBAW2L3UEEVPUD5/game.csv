"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm targeting a price closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000 again, or we could meet in the middle at $975,000. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
