"Hi Alice, thanks for your opening offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential returns.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
