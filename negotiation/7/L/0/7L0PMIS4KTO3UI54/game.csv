"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  This reflects the maximum value I'm able to place on this product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's worth and your budget. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1400000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which reflects the maximum value I can realistically assign to this product at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value to me and your willingness to negotiate.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $1200000 is enough for the product's value. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's worth. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
