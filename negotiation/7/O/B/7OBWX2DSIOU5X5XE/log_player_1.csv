Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to your operations. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at $950,000. I think this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your perspective on the value of the product. While I understand its potential, I would like to propose a price closer to my valuation. My counteroffer is $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own stated valuation of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there is room for negotiation. You're better off rejecting this offer and proposing a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it falls significantly short of my valuation for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** You acknowledge Bob's counteroffer while standing firm on your valuation.
* **Find a middle ground:**  By proposing $850,000 (the midpoint between $950,000 and $750,000), you signal flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Maintain a strong position:** This counteroffer is still well above your minimum price ($800,000) and encourages Bob to move closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice, but I still feel that we're quite far apart in terms of valuation. I'd like to stick to my original proposal of $750,000. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his lowball offer, indicating he might be trying to anchor the negotiation at a lower price point. It's important to signal that you're not willing to settle for a price significantly below your minimum. You still have room to negotiate above your guaranteed sale price with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need you to understand that this product holds significant value and $750,000 simply doesn't reflect that.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** You reiterate that his offer is too low while making a smaller concession to show you are willing to negotiate. 
* **Introduce a deadline:**  By stating this is your final offer, you create urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Highlight value:**  Remind Bob of the product's benefits to incentivize him to accept a higher price. 

This approach balances firmness on price with a willingness to compromise, increasing the likelihood of securing a deal closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. While I respect your view on the product's value, I still believe we're not aligned on pricing. I would like to continue with my counteroffer of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is not budging:** Bob has now repeated his offer of $750,000 multiple times, even after you've made concessions. This suggests he's unlikely to move significantly closer to your target price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting valuable time that could be spent finalizing the sale with John.  
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob for a potentially small increase. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and secure a profitable deal with John."
