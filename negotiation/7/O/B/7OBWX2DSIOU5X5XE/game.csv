"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it falls significantly short of my valuation for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your proposal, Alice, but I still feel that we're quite far apart in terms of valuation. I'd like to stick to my original proposal of $750,000. I hope we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need you to understand that this product holds significant value and $750,000 simply doesn't reflect that.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. While I respect your view on the product's value, I still believe we're not aligned on pricing. I would like to continue with my counteroffer of $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,6,
