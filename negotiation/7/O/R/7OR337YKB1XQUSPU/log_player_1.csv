Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,500,000, but John guarantees that price.
* **Creating Value for Bob:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 gives Bob a potential profit of $350,000 if he leverages the product effectively. 
* **Maximizing Your Gain:** While you could ask for a much higher price, starting with $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit beyond your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

1. **Securing a Sale:**  The price is attractive enough for Bob to seriously consider.
2. **Maximizing Profit:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, aiming for the best possible deal for you."
