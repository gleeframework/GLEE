"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  $900,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a little tight on budget.  Would you be willing to go to $925,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
