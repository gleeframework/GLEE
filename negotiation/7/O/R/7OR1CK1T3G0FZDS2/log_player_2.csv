"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target value:** You're aiming to get the product for under $1,200,000, and Alice's initial offer is $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, and Alice's initial offer leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** You have the option to buy from John, so you don't need to accept an unreasonable offer. 

**Next Steps:** You'll need to create a counteroffer to Alice in the next round. Try to bring the price down closer to your target value while still remaining within a range that Alice might find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low but not too low:**  A counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for compromise. It's also closer to your target value.
* **Be polite but firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses your willingness to negotiate, while also stating your position clearly. 
* **Focus on value:** You are framing the offer in terms of what the product is worth to you, not just a random price. 

**Next Steps:**  Alice will either accept your counteroffer or reject it and make a new counteroffer.  Be prepared to either negotiate further or accept her offer, depending on her response.  If you feel she's not moving closer to your price, you might consider accepting her offer, as you have a higher chance of getting a lower price than John's."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $900,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to your target:** Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is closer to your desired price range. 
* **Still room for negotiation:** There's still some wiggle room to get the price lower. You've already shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice seems open to it.
* **Buying from John is still an option:** You have the fallback of buying from John if you can't get a better deal from Alice. 

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer again. Aim for a price somewhere between $900,000 and $950,000, showing that you're serious about making a deal but still looking for a better price.  You can also try to emphasize the value of the product to you again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a little tight on budget.  Would you be willing to go to $925,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant reduction:**  A counteroffer of $925,000 shows you're serious about negotiating without being overly aggressive. It also demonstrates that you're willing to compromise.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:**  Reiterate that the price is fair for both parties, and highlight the likelihood of closing the deal.
* **Stay within your target:**  $925,000 is still below your maximum price point of $1,200,000.

**Next Steps:**  Alice will either accept your counteroffer, reject it, or make a new counteroffer. Be prepared to respond accordingly, keeping in mind your target price and the possibility of buying from John if you can't reach an agreement."
