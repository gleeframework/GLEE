It's a good deal at $5,000, but there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $4,000 is a good starting point, but I'm prepared to go higher if needed."

$4,500 is a good price, and we're getting closer to my target.  It's better than the $8,000 I'd have to pay John."
