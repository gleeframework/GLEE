"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is too far below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $1,075,000? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,075,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $1,125,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?  That would make this a done deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
