"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is too far below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

I still need a higher price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,075,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $1,125,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?  That would make this a done deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is close to my minimum, I'm running out of time. I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
