"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe you'll find very valuable.  I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your generosity, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, or I can choose to sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price reflects the product's value and gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering Strategically:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while demonstrating the value I'm placing on the product.
* **Focusing on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the deal's value to Bob, making it appealing. 
* **Open to Compromise:**  I'm using language like ""common ground"" to signal that I'm open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose an offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Middle Ground:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly what the product is worth to him.  This means accepting his offer would result in a fair trade for both of us.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely, and I'd be left with no deal.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a profit.
* **Time Constraint:** With 6 rounds left, I need to make a decision quickly, and this offer is a good compromise."
