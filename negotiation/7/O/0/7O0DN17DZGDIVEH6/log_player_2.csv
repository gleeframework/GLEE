Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to come down to $9500, but that's my final offer.
