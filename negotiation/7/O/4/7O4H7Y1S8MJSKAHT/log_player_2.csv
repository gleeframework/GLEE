"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Explanation: Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation. You should reject this offer and try to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
```

Explanation: We start with a strong counter-offer significantly below both Alice's offer and your maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that you're serious about buying but need a much lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $125. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Explanation: While Alice came down from her initial offer, $125 is still above your maximum budget. It's clear you won't reach a deal quickly, and there's a risk of running out of rounds. You should reject and continue negotiating, but be mindful of John's alternative offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

Explanation: We're inching closer to your maximum budget, but it's important to keep negotiating. This offer splits the difference between Alice's previous offer and your last counter-offer. It shows willingness to move but also emphasizes your budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer with a price of $130. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Explanation: Alice's offer has gone up, not down. This suggests she's not genuinely negotiating and might even be trying to take advantage of your desire for a deal. Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, which is within your budget, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal.  Continuing with Alice carries the risk of the price going even higher or failing to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
