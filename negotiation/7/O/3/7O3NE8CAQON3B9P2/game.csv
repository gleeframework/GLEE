"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to refuse.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to offer $700,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while still allowing you to make a significant profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Alice,3,
