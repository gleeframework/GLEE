"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to refuse. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better price.  It's too early to buy from John, as the potential to save money with Alice is still there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to offer $700,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while still allowing you to make a significant profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and $750,000 is a good deal considering the product's value to me. Accepting this offer saves me $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of reaching a stalemate or Alice rejecting further offers outweighs the potential for a few more thousand dollars in savings."
