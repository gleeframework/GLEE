"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a price that's fair to both of us, and it allows you to secure this valuable product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and buying from John would cost you more."
