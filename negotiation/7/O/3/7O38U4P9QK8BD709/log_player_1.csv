Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I know you'll find it valuable, so I'm proposing a price of $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so don't miss out!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a higher price ($11,500) leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially influencing Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Important Note:**  While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's always a chance Bob could reject the offer. However, since you have a backup buyer, you're not at risk of selling below your minimum acceptable price."
