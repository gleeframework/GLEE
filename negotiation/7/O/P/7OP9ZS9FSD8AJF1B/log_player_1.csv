Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** The offer of $1,300,000 seeks a middle ground between your valuation ($1,500,000) and Bob's valuation ($800,000). While it's significantly more than Bob's perceived value, it positions the offer as a potentially profitable deal for you if he accepts.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a strong backup plan with John willing to pay your desired price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Bob may counter-offer, and you will need to decide whether to accept, reject, or continue negotiating.
* Consider Bob's personality and negotiation style. If you anticipate him being highly price-sensitive, you might adjust your initial offer slightly lower."
