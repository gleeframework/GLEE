"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $550,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $525,000. This is as low as I can go without compromising the product's value.",525000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I can tell this product means a lot to you.  How about we settle at $480,000?  That's a fair compromise and shows I'm serious about buying.",480000.0,Bob,6,
