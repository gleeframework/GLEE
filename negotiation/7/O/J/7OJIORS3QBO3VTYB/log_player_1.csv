{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him some room to negotiate. It's also a reasonable starting point, as I'm aiming to earn as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
