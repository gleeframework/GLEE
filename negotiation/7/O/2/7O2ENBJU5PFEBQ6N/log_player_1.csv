Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching closer to his perceived value ($1,200,000) while we are still significantly above our minimum ($1,500,000).  It's time to hold firm and see if we can draw him up.  We still have negotiating room and the backup offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand that finding the right price is important for both of us. However, I need to be upfront â€“  $1,700,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,850,000, but that's my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are now setting a firm boundary while still offering a price above our minimum.  This conveys seriousness and a willingness to close the deal, but not at any cost.  The slight concession from our previous counter-offer may entice Bob to move closer to our position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we'd ideally like to get closer to $1,800,000, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,750,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum ($1,500,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away or further dragging out negotiations."
