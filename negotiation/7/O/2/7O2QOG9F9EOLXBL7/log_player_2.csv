# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done, but I'm not willing to go below this price. What do you think?
