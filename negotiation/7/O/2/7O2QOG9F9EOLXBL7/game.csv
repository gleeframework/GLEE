"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done, but I'm not willing to go below this price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm limited to spending $800,000.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This shows my commitment to the deal while staying within my budget. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm very serious about acquiring this product, but I can't go higher than $900,000.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in closing this deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I think the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
