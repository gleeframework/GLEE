Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $100 for it."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, giving a brief reason can make the offer feel more compelling. 
* **Alternative Incentive:**  Mentioning that you'll offer it to someone else if Bob declines adds a subtle sense of urgency and scarcity.

**Important:** It's unlikely Bob will accept $100 knowing the product is only worth $80 to him. However, this opening offer gives you space to negotiate down towards your minimum acceptable price while still maximizing your potential profit."
