"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,10500.0
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  It's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,11000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $9,750. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,5,,
