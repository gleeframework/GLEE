,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's continue to negotiate and see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
