Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up, increasing your profit slightly.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John provides leverage. You don't need to desperately negotiate with Bob. 

This approach balances ambition with the security of a fallback option."
