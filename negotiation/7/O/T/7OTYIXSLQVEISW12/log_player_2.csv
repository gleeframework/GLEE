# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you consider $17,000? I'm willing to be a little flexible to make this work for both of us.
