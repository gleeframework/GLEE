"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, that price is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you consider $17,000? I'm willing to be a little flexible to make this work for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can go up to $12,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $12,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'd be willing to accept $14,500, which is my final offer.  This is a fantastic deal on a product you won't find elsewhere.",14500.0,Alice,5,
