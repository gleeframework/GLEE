"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering its value to me is $800000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. Considering its true value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $850000. I'm not willing to go any higher, as that's the maximum I can afford. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make one more offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $875000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, please let me know.",875000.0,Alice,5,
