I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than $12,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still ensuring I get a price closer to my initial value. Hopefully, this will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer of $11,000 is a good compromise, as selling to John would only yield $12,000."
