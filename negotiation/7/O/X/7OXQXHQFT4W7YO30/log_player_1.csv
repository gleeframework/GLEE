"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for more.  I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. I'll see if I can squeeze out a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to hold out for a higher price. This offer is a compromise, but I believe it's fair considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to risk another round to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping Bob will budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

We're getting close to the end, and I'm starting to feel the pressure to make a deal. I'm going to make one last counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's last offer. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping he'll finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better price from Bob. He seems stuck at $10,000, and with only two rounds left, I'm risking losing out on a much better deal with John. It's time to secure the guaranteed $15,000."
