Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. How about a price of $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $100 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, earning you a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $90 is a strong starting point. It's a price where:
    * Bob might be tempted as it's a $10 ""discount"" from John's offer.
    * You still earn a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price ($100). 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing your potential profit."
