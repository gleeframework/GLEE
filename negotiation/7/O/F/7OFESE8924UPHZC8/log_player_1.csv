# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable settling for $900,000. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob. I'm also confident that I can get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, I'm still confident that the product holds greater value.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000.  This reflects the unique potential of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the same as John's offer.  Since I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob. Selling to John ensures a quick and certain sale at my minimum acceptable price."
