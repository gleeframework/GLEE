"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and features, it's worth more than $150 to me. Considering its value and the fact that it's worth $80 to you, I propose a fair deal of $120 for the product. This price ensures both satisfaction and a reasonable profit for me. I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
