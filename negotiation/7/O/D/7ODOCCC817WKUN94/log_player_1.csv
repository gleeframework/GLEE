{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}

This offer sets a price that is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. It also conveys confidence in the product's value, hoping to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I am interested in purchasing it, but I would like to propose a lower price of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get a price closer to my $120 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be reasonable, but $92 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $94?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I will consider it, but I would like to propose a price of $93 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $93 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to continue negotiating further and risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John for $120. The potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risk. I'll accept John's offer and sell to him."
