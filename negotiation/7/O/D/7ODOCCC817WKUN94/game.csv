"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to be reasonable, but $92 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $94?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",94.0,Alice,5,
