"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $135, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $135 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You're better off saving the $15 and going with your guaranteed option."
