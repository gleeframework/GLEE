{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to the product's worth to Bob while still exceeding my minimum.  I'll need to be flexible and adjust my offer based on Bob's responses, but I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,500. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price and it's likely that further negotiation will only be more time-consuming. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing the sale to another buyer or potentially ending up with a lower price."
