{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. How about a price of $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $1,500,000, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price gives me a chance to make a profit above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,350,000 is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to potentially secure a deal quickly rather than waiting for John.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps me gauge Bob's interest level and potential for negotiation. If he rejects this offer outright, it suggests he might not be willing to pay much more than his valuation. I can then decide whether to counter-offer or proceed with John."
