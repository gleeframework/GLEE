"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $800,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $850,000 is still too far below my minimum price point.  Let's aim for a price that's more in line with the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would represent a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",950000.0,Alice,5,
