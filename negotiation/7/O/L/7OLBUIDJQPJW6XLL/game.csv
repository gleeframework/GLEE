,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $130 right now.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but the product's value is quite a bit higher than that for me. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $170 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $145.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",145.0,Bob,4,
