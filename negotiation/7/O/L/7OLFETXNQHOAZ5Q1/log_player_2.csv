**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not budging from the range of $8,500 - $9,500.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get the price down to an acceptable level.  Buying from John at $12,000, while not ideal, is preferable to getting stuck in a stalemate with Alice and potentially paying even more."
