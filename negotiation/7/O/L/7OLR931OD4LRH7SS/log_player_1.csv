Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe could be very valuable to your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will deliver a strong return. I know you're a smart businessman, and I trust you'll see the potential in this opportunity. Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $1,000,000 as my offer. This is a price that is above Bob's valuation of $800,000 but lower than my own valuation of $1,200,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value proposition of the product to Bob's business. It emphasizes the potential return on investment and appeals to Bob's intelligence and business acumen.

**Reasoning:**

This approach attempts to strike a balance between maximizing my earnings and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.

* By offering a price lower than my minimum, I increase the chances of Bob agreeing to the deal. 
* However, the price is still high enough that I will earn a significant profit compared to selling to John. 

**Important Note:** This is a simple strategy based on limited information. A more nuanced approach would consider factors like Bob's financial situation, the negotiation dynamics, and the potential for future business relationships."
