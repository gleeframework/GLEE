"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your initial asking price.  However,  I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would still represent a significant saving for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
