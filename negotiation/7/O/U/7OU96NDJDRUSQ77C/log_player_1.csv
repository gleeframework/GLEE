""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the likelihood of a sale while maximizing your profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so there's no risk of going below that.

By offering the product at $120, you create a win-win situation:

* **Bob saves $30** compared to his perceived value.
* **You make a $40 profit,** which is significantly more than your guaranteed $80 from John."
