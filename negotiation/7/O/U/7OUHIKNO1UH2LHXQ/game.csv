"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to see if we can reach an agreement.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
