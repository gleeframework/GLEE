"Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to take the product off your hands.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $120 is still a bit below my minimum price. How about we meet at $130? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
