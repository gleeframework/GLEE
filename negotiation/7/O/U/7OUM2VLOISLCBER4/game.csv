"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could you consider $725,000? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $725,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's benefits you'll receive.",850000.0,Alice,5,
