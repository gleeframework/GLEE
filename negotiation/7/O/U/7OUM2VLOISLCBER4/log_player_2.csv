"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could you consider $725,000? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $725,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's benefits you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  While she might come down slightly in further rounds, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, making it the safer and more economical choice at this point."
