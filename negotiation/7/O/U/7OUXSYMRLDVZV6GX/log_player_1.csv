Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its true value."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves a small window for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above Minimum:** The price is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($10,000), ensuring a good profit.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while still having a backup buyer."
