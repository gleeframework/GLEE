"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
