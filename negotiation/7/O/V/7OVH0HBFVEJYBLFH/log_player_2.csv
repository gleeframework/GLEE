Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. However,  $10,000 undervalues the product's true worth and the benefits it brings.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this price reflects the product's quality while still offering you significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your budget, but $17,000 is still above your maximum.  You're better off rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,000? This price is still fair, and I'm confident it's a good value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to make this deal happen, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  Let's settle this right now - how about $14,500? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to be realistic about the product's value, but so do I.  $14,500 is still outside my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $13,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
