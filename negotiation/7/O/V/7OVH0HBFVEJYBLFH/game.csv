"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob. However,  $10,000 undervalues the product's true worth and the benefits it brings.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this price reflects the product's quality while still offering you significant value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,000? This price is still fair, and I'm confident it's a good value for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to make this deal happen, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  Let's settle this right now - how about $14,500? This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to be realistic about the product's value, but so do I.  $14,500 is still outside my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $13,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal. ",13000.0,Bob,6,
