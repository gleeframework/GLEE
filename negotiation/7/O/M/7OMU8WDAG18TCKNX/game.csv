"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid I won't be able to accept $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Unfortunately, $11000 is still beyond my current budget. Could you perhaps lower the price further? I am willing to pay up to $9500.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm sorry, Bob, but I've already made it clear that $9500 is below my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm afraid we're at an impasse. I'm going to have to sell the product to someone else.",12000.0,Alice,11,
