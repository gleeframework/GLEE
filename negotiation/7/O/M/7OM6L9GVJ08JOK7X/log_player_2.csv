"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's significantly below its true worth. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you and allows you to secure a product that will be a valuable asset.  Consider this offer carefully, as I have another interested buyer willing to pay a significantly higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
