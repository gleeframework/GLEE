Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 107.50}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 8

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  It's getting close to the end of the negotiations, and Bob seems to be sticking to his $103 offer.  While that's better than my initial price, it's not worth risking another round with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing.  John's offer is guaranteed, and it's a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me."
