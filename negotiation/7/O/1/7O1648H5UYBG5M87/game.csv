"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  I believe it will be highly valuable to your business. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the significant value it will bring to your business in the long run.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,800,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is just too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal today. If you're willing to agree to $1,550,000, I'm prepared to finalize the paperwork today.  This offer is only valid for the next 24 hours, as I do have other interested parties.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the urgency, but I'm not willing to pay $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to consider it seriously.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
