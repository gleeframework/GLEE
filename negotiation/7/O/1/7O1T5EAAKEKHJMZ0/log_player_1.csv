Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's in excellent condition and worth much more than that! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get more than $110. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for less than my minimum price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 120}
