"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to acquire this product for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a decent profit while still saving me a significant amount.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident in the value this product brings, especially to someone like you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's try $1,075,000.  This would be a good middle ground, allowing both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I have to stand firm at $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product and allows me a reasonable profit. I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
