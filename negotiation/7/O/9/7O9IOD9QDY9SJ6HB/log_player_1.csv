{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it's a reasonable price that is still significantly higher than your minimum requirement of $10,000. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum price, it's still significantly lower than your desired profit. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $13,000? This would still give you a good value for the product, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is still lower than my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  It's above my minimum requirement and it's likely that Bob won't offer more. It's better to close the deal now rather than risk a further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a sale to John for a significantly lower amount."
