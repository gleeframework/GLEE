"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $120.**  You want to save money, so accepting this offer is not the best choice.
* **Rejecting allows you to negotiate.** You can try to get Alice down to a price you are comfortable with. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** You should try to negotiate with Alice first, as she's selling the product for $100, which means there's room for a deal that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $105? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $105 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's new offer is within your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, and $110 is a good compromise.
* **You've already negotiated.** Rejecting again might risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Accepting saves you time and money.** You'll get the product for $10 less than John's price, which is a good outcome."
