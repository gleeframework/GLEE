I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I need to get. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my target than John's offer and still a decent return. I don't want to risk losing out on the sale altogether, especially since Bob seems to be at his limit."
