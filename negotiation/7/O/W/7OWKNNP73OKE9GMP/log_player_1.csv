Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,110,000 is the right price.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final attempt to reach a compromise. I propose a counteroffer of $1,060,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can meet in the middle.

While we could push Bob further, it's getting risky. Accepting $1,060,000 is a good deal, well above our minimum and a decent profit over John's offer.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely."
