Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've done my research, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than $12,000. Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12,000, so I'll offer $13,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of $13,000. This is a good price, considering my minimum goal of $10,000 and the possibility of Bob rejecting further counteroffers."
