Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. $975,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This would allow me to accept your offer and still get a reasonable profit.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice has come down to her value for the product. There's no guarantee of getting a better price, and continuing negotiations might make her less willing to compromise.  Accepting the $1,000,000 offer ensures you get the product and stay under budget."
