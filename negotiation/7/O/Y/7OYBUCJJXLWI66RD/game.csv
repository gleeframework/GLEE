"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think it's well worth the price.  What do you say?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to compromise, but $130 is simply not enough for me. Let's try $133. That's closer to my bottom line, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",133.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $133 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $129? I'm really close to walking away if we can't come to an agreement.",129.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $129 is simply not enough for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we compromise at $131? That's a very small step from my last offer, and I'm really trying to get this deal done.",131.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $131 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. Would you consider $128? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",128.0,Bob,8,
