```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no immediate incentive to accept.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13500? I believe that's a fair price that still gives you a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $13,500 is a good deal within your budget.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but the potential savings may not be worth the time and effort. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
