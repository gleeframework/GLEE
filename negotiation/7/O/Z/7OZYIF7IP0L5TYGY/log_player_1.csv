Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I think I can do better.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
