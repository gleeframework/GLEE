"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and what John offers. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go as high as $8,000."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000), we aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This initial offer acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Alice to propose counteroffers closer to our desired range.
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the backup option of buying from John at $10,000, giving us leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $14,000 represents fair value, I understand your position.  Could you do $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** Alice moved significantly from her initial price, indicating she's willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still above our budget and what John offers.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's a $1,000 difference between Alice's offer and our ideal price.  We can try to negotiate further. 
* **John as leverage:** We can use John's offer as leverage to show Alice we have an alternative and encourage her to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,000 is closer, but I still can't justify that price.  I'd be willing to meet you at $9,000.  That's the maximum I can offer."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're splitting the difference between our previous offer ($8,000) and Alice's current offer ($11,000). This shows a willingness to compromise but keeps the pressure on Alice.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message emphasizes this is our maximum price, reinforcing our budget constraint while maintaining a positive tone.
* **Deadline Implied:** By not budging much, we subtly communicate a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Alice to accept before we consider John's offer more seriously."
