"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective,  $11,500 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",12200.0,Bob,4,
