```

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired $1,000,000.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the product's value for Bob can help him see the potential.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This is just the opening offer, and I'm ready to negotiate.

I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing in on the Target:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price of $1,000,000, but there is only one round left.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I don't want to risk going another round with Bob and potentially losing a substantial amount of money.  
* **John Offers Security:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This ensures that I don't lose out on a significant profit.

Therefore, it is more prudent to sell the product to John and secure the guaranteed price.  I've had a good negotiation with Bob, but ultimately, I need to prioritize the outcome that guarantees the best financial result for me."
