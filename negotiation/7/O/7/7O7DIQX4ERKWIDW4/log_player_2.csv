"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is less than the $120 John is charging, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I have to make a living. I can do $95, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, he still has room to negotiate. Bob values the product at $120, and Alice's offer is still above her cost. There's potential for a lower price, so rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $92. That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll do $97. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $120, and Alice's offer of $97 is significantly less.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could continue to negotiate, the difference between his counteroffer of $92 and Alice's offer of $97 is only $5.  
* **Time:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of continuing negotiation is that Alice might walk away or become less flexible.
* **Alternative:** John is still offering the product for $120, which is significantly more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob. He gets the product at a good price, and he avoids the risk of either losing the deal or having to pay more to John."
