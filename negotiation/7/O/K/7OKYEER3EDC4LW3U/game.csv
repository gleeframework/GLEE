"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate the opportunity. However, $7500 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $6500 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $6500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7000. It's still a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $6750 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6900. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",6900.0,Alice,5,
