Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer the product at $150, there's a chance Bob might reject it. By offering it slightly lower at $140, you increase the likelihood of him accepting and you still make a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** This price point leaves Bob with a perceived ""surplus"" ($140 offer vs. his $100 value) making it more enticing for him to accept.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, so there's no risk of getting stuck with the product."
