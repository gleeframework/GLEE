"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can consider a price of $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While I see the value in the product, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would that be workable for you?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can offer you a price of $10,000, which is still a good compromise. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,
