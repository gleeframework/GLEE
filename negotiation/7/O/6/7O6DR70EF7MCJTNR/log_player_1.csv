Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That's a significant investment on my part and reflects a fair compromise.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good business decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** Even at $1,300,000, I am still making a substantial profit over Bob's perceived value. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation delays receiving payment. Closing the deal now puts the money in my pocket sooner.
* **Risk of Losing the Sale:** Pushing Bob too hard could make him walk away, leaving me to rely on John's offer.  

Accepting $1.3 million balances profit maximization with the practicalities of negotiation and business."
