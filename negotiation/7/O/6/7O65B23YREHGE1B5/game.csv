"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way to $10,500, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can do $11,200. It's the highest I'm willing to go, though!",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $10,200? This is a fair offer, considering the market value.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can meet you at $10,800, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you, if I do say so myself!",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely getting close.  I'm willing to bump my offer up a bit to $10,400. Let's make this deal happen!",10400.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,600. That's my final offer, though - I won't go any lower than that.",10600.0,Alice,9,
