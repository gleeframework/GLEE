Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your decision, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Justification:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" are used to create a sense of desirability and justify the high price.
* **Alternative option:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, subtly pressuring Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit. If Bob accepts, you gain an extra $500,000. If he rejects it, you can still sell to John at your desired minimum price."
