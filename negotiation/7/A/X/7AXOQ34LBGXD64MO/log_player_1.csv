{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. My starting price is $1,750,000. This reflects the unique value and potential of this product. I'm open to discussion, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits it can bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. $1,400,000 is too far below my minimum, and I still have 8 rounds to try and reach a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. While I'm always open to negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning this product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits it can bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would have preferred to get more, accepting his offer ensures a quick and certain sale.  There's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds, and time is valuable."
