"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a great value for you considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the potential value of the product to Bob, which can encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, showing that I'm open to discussion. 

**Important Note:**  I'm setting a high initial price to maximize my potential earnings.  However, I'm aware of the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Below My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below the $1,000,000 I'm hoping to achieve.
* **Potential for Higher Offers:**  Since Bob is willing to pay close to $1 million, there's potential for a more favorable outcome with further negotiation.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  I have the security of John's offer, allowing me to take a risk with Bob and potentially get a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1 million. I'll be prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I need to stay closer to $1 million to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, demonstrating that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Close to Target:**  $1,050,000 is within reach of my target price of $1,000,000,  but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Open Dialogue:**  The message encourages Bob to continue the conversation and explore possibilities for reaching an agreement. 

**Important Note:**  I'm carefully considering the value of John's offer. If Bob doesn't come closer to my target price in the next few rounds, I may choose to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

* **Guaranteed Income:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum desired amount.
