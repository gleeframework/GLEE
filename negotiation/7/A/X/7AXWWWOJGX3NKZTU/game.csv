"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to do $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as 75. How about we meet in the middle at 82.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $80, which is fair for both of us?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already invested a lot into this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as 80. How about we meet at 81? It's still a good compromise, and I think it's worth considering.",81.0,Alice,5,
