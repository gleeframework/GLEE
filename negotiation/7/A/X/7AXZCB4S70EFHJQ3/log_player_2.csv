"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Since you have a maximum budget of $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  You can try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about buying but need a better price. $8,500 is still a good deal for you, leaving some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is closer to my target price, but I'm still within my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if I can push for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $8,500. I'm not in a rush, and I have 7 rounds left to find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating willingness to meet halfway. $9,000 is still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
