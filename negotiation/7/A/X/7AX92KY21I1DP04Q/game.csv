"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value. I'm eager to move forward with this deal, but  need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its market value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000? This price acknowledges the product's true worth while still offering you a competitive advantage.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to move forward with the purchase.",900000.0,Bob,4,

This is a substantial amount for me, and I'm confident this price reflects the value we both see in this transaction.",950000.0,Bob,6,
