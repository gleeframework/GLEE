Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for Bob to meet me halfway while ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to $950,000,  $920,000 is a good price considering the risk of going through more negotiation rounds and potentially losing the deal to Bob or having to sell to John for a lower amount."
