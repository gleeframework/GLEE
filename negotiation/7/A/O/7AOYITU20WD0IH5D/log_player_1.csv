"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Language:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question, inviting Bob to engage in a discussion. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum price ($1,000,000) as possible while still maximizing my profit. I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's offers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** I have 9 rounds left, and I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to bridge the gap between our expectations. I'm confident that I can get a better price than Bob's initial offer, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if the negotiations don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,100,000.  It's a great product and this offer reflects its true value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to reinforce my position.
* **Open Ended Question:** I end with a question that encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get a price closer to my minimum while still maintaining a reasonable margin. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to move closer to my counteroffer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating until I reach a mutually acceptable price or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,000,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No need for further negotiation:**  There's no need to continue negotiating as I've reached my desired price. 
* **Avoid risk of losing to John:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob walking away, leaving me with no sale.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at my minimum price, maximizing my profit and minimizing risk."
