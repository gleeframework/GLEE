"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $1,050,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
