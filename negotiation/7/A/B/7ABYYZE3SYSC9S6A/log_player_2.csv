"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than the price you'd pay John ($15,000). 
* This means you save $3,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* Even though the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, that information is irrelevant to your decision as a buyer. You are focusing on your own value and the best deal available."
