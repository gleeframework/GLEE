"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your honest offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a good midpoint between our last offers.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows us to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a fair agreement, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
