Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this deal. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $8,500 is the lowest I can go. This is already a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. It's in your best interest to secure the $8,000 deal with John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
