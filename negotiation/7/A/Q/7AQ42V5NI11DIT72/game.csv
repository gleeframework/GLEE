"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm willing to purchase it directly from you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
