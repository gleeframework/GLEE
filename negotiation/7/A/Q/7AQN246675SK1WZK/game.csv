,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $13500 for the product. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13250 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $14000 for the product. This is my last offer, but I'm willing to sell it to you if you're willing to meet me at this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $13750 for the product. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're not willing to meet me at $14000, but I appreciate your final offer. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. I'm willing to make one last offer to you, but I need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. I can do $13900 for the product, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",13900.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your minimum price as possible, but $13900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $13750 for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle, but I'm willing to make one more offer. I can do $13800 for the product, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating with you.",13800.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting frustrated, but I'm not willing to go above $13750 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous offer, so I'll make a final offer of $13800. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13750.0,Bob,10,
