Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's common in negotiation to start with a higher price, leaving room for potential compromise. 
* **Value proposition:**  The message emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob, creating a reason for him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to engage in the negotiation, signaling flexibility. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just an initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and my knowledge of the product's market value.
* I'll also keep in mind that I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to explore if I can get more.
* **Potential for higher price:** Bob's initial interest and willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room for a higher price.
* **Counteroffer to test the waters:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and gauge his true budget and level of interest. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above his offer.  I'll try to find a price that's attractive to him while remaining profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $15,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This reflects the unique value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Justification:** I reiterate the unique value of the product to justify my higher price.
* **Open to further discussion:**  The message leaves the door open for continued dialogue and potential compromise.

**Strategy:**

* I'm testing the waters with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's.
*  I'll observe Bob's response to gauge his level of interest and his budget. 
*  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response, keeping in mind my minimum price and the guaranteed $15,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $16,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price, and it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting this offer keeps the door open for future negotiations with Bob if he's a good customer.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and uncertain.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and move on.

**Important Note:**

While accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this round, I would have been more inclined to make another counteroffer if Bob's offer had been closer to $15,000."
