"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $900,000 is appealing, I can't quite meet that number. Could we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $975,000 as my final offer. This allows me to still make a reasonable deal. Let me know your thoughts.",975000.0,Alice,5,
