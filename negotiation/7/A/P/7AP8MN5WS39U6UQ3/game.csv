,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $1,080,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,065,000. This price is a significant step closer to my target, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1065000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my target, but $1,070,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,067,500. This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's try to find that sweet spot where we both feel comfortable.",1067500.0,Bob,6,
