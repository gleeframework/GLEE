"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this high-quality product for a competitive price. I believe you'll find it's a great investment for your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000.
* Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000.
* However, you can still try to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting her initial offer gives you leverage to potentially get a lower price."
