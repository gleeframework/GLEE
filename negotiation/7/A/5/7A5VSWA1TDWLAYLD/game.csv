"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional item. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a fair price. My initial offer is $15000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the unique opportunity to acquire this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $11000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being a reasonable compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to consider $10000? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. Considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far, I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is my final offer in this range, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $10500, which would be $10250. I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to commit to purchasing it at that price.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below my minimum price. Considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far, I'm willing to go up to $10750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. If we can't meet at this point, I'll need to consider other options.",10750.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10500, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. If we can meet at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. Considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far, I'm willing to go up to $10750, but only if you're willing to commit to a purchase agreement with a small premium for expedited delivery. This would be a one-time payment of $250, making the total price $10000. If you're willing to accept this, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your creativity with the expedited delivery offer, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $10750. I'm willing to make one final offer: $10500, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase immediately. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,10,
