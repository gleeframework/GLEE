"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $140 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is a bit tight for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $137.50. What do you think?",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  However, $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $138. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",138.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I'm trying to save. How about we split the difference and I take it for $136.50? I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",136.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $139. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",139.0,Alice,7,
