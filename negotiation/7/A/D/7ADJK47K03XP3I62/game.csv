"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a significant value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still a bit too far away from my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,275,000.
