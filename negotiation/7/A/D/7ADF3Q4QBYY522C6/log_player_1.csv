I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, so this offer is a significant markup. I'm expecting Bob to counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate.  If he rejects this offer outright, I'll consider his counteroffer and then decide whether to continue the negotiation or accept John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

$800,000 is far too low for me.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will show Bob that I'm serious about selling, but that I'm also not going to give the product away. I'm confident that I can get a better price than $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to accept anything that's significantly below my minimum price. I'm confident that I can get a better price, even if it means continuing the negotiation."

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price than $900,000. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm not going to settle for anything too far below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to accept anything that's significantly below my minimum price.  I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price."

I'm taking a more significant step towards Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that feels reasonable.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my commitment to the deal while still allowing for a healthy profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm concerned we're getting stuck in a negotiation loop. John is a guaranteed buyer with a solid offer. It's time to end this negotiation and secure the sale with John."
