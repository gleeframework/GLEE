"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product and understand its value, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to recoup some of the value of the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  How about we compromise at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
