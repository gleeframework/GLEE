"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,500 is still a bit high for what I had in mind.  Could you do $7,500?"", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $7,500 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $8,750.  At this point, John's offer of $8,000 is a better deal and saves further negotiation."
