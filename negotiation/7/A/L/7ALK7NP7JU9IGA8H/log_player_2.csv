"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay the minimum of $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no incentive to accept her offer as you can get the same product from John for the same price. 
* You're trying to save money, and buying from John guarantees you won't pay more than $12,000."
