Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My primary goal is to get the highest price possible. Since the product is worth $10,000 to both me and Bob, there's room for negotiation.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high gives me bargaining power. Bob might counter-offer, giving me the chance to potentially still get more than $10,000.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. I won't accept anything less than that amount."
