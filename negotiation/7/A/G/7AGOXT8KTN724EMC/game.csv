,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about $95? I believe that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
