Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good compromise because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives him some incentive to buy, as he'll still be getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than my ""Plan B"" price:** This means I'll still earn more than if I sell to John, making it a profitable deal for me. 

By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, I'm increasing the chance of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a good profit."
