Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $15,000. Is this a price you'd be interested in?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $12,000, the minimum I'm willing to accept?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
