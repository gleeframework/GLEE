"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down on the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget.  I'd be interested if it were closer to $60."",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a low offer ($60) leaves room for negotiation but signals you're serious about getting a good price. 
* **Polite and interested:** Even though the initial offer was high, you remain polite and express continued interest in the product. 
* **Sets a target:** This counteroffer aims to get Alice thinking closer to your acceptable price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $60. Could you meet me halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is negotiating, $90 is still above your target price and your upper limit. You have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($90) and your previous counteroffer ($60). 
* **Fairness appeal:** Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Alice to see it as a win-win.
* **Strategic positioning:** $75 is still a good amount below your maximum budget, giving you room to negotiate up slightly if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $85, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $85 is still above your ideal price and your fallback option (buying from John). It's worth one more try to see if you can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, how about we settle at $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This counteroffer presents your absolute maximum price. It's a firm but fair offer.
* **Highlighting compromise:** By saying you're willing to ""stretch"" your budget, you emphasize that you're also making a concession.
* **Time constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, it's time to see if Alice is truly willing to meet your price or if you need to go with John."
