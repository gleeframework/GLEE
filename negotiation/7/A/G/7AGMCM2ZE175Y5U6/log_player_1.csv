Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I get a strong return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  This is still a good profit for you, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of $1,000,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000.  This will give us both a good deal and allows us to finalize this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $925,000 is a good compromise and is closer to my desired price point. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
