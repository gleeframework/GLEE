Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower your price later.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,200,000, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation around a higher value. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers are likely to be closer to my asking price than if I had started lower.
* **Alternative Option:** I have John as a backup buyer at $800,000, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This price is still a good deal for both of us and allows me to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant jump from his initial rejection of $1,200,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and propose a counteroffer that is still significantly above my minimum selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 is more reflective of its worth.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, this is still a significant markup from his offer and well above my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and encourage Bob to meet me closer to my asking price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By suggesting a willingness to ""meet in the middle,"" I'm signaling flexibility and encouraging further counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. This price allows both of us to make a reasonable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a solid deal. While I could potentially negotiate for a bit more, the difference is likely to be relatively small. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit ($150,000 above my minimum) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
