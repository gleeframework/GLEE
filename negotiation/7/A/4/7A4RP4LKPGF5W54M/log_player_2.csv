"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating for a lower price or buy it from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too pricey for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message aims to be polite and convey that we're interested but need a price that works for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $125?  It's still a good deal for you and a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice's counteroffer of $125 is within our budget and only $5 more than buying from John. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're on round 3 of 10. Further haggling might not yield a significant enough discount to justify the time and risk of losing the deal."
