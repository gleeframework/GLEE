I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a bit more to get the product."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is worth a good price, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $10,000. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've been going back and forth with Bob for a while, and while I could try to negotiate further,  it's getting close to my minimum and I'm running out of rounds.  John's offer is a guaranteed $12,000, so I'm going to take it."
