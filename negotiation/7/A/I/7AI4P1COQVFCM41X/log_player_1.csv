"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high with $10,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I believe it's important to start high to leave room for concessions and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can secure a higher price, especially since Bob has shown interest. I'll try to find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a profit.  It's also a good move for Bob as he can potentially get the product at a price closer to his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $7,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to risk a couple more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target.  John is a safety net, but I'm confident I can get a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it still gives me a $500 profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer.  If he rejects, it's getting close to the point where I might sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd like to get closer to my target price, Bob's offers are getting too low.  It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement, and I don't want to risk losing out on the $8,000 from John."
