"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,112,500?  This price is still within your budget and allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're committed to getting a great deal, and I respect that.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $1,103,125.  That's a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1103125.0,Alice,5,
