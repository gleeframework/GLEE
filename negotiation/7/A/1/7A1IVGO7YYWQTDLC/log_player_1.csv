"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also leaving some room for negotiation, as Bob might counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is a good price, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $12,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $11,500, which is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer. I believe this is a reasonable price that could lead to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,800 is close to what the product is worth to Bob, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can find a common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
``` 

I'm offering $11,200, which is closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and might be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of rounds, and the negotiations are getting close to my minimum value. It's better to secure the sale with John at $12,000, which is my minimum target, rather than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
