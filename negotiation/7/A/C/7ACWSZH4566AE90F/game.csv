"Alice, your offer is a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  I believe this price still reflects the value of the product while also providing a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
