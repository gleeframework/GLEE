Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $149.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting high leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially exceeding John's $150 offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $150 immediately might make Bob think I'm desperate to sell and undervalue the product. 

By pricing it slightly below my guaranteed sale price, I increase the chances of Bob accepting while still securing a near-optimal outcome."
