Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's always advantageous to explore if you can get a higher price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a strong offer close to your minimum allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Understanding Bob's Perspective:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it just below your guaranteed price makes it seem like a steal compared to what he perceives as its worth.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your potential profit."
