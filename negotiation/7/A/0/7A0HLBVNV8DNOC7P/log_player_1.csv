Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that you'd still be making a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
