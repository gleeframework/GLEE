"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
