"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $9,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $9,500?  That would give you a great deal, and it's a price I can work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has three options:

1. **Accept Alice's offer ($9,500):** This is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000. 
2. **Reject Alice's offer and counteroffer:** This risks Alice walking away from the deal, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price.
3. **Buy from John ($12,000):** This is the most expensive option and should be avoided if possible.

Given these options, accepting Alice's offer at $9,500 is the most logical choice for Bob. He saves $2,500 compared to John's price and gets a good deal."
