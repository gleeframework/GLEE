"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Alice is likely willing to negotiate lower, especially since the product is only worth $80 to her."
