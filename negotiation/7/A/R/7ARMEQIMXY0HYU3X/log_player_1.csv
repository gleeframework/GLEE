Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's more than my minimum:** I'm aiming for a profit, and $150 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at the highest possible price, leaving space for Bob to potentially counter-offer. 

If Bob rejects, I can always fall back to John's offer of $100."
