Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still leaves room for Bob to see value at $1,000,000. It's unlikely he'd accept a price much higher.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" we add a touch of urgency and desirability.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer. We'll need to decide if we're willing to go lower or risk losing the sale to him.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If we're confident in John's offer, we don't want to spend excessive time negotiating with Bob."
