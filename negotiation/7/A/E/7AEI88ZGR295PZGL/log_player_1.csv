"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob will gain by accepting the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not giving away the farm. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy is a starting point. I'll need to adjust based on Bob's responses and my goal of maximizing profit while keeping the deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, $13,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Could you consider a price closer to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, it indicates he's still interested.  
* **Time to Counter:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price that's more favorable to me.

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer. I want to stay above my minimum price while still being attractive enough for Bob to potentially accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $6,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still gives you a great deal considering the value to you, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still keeping it significantly above Bob's offer. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm reiterating the value Bob would get, making the offer more appealing.
* **Keep the Negotiation Going:**  I want to keep the door open for further negotiation if necessary.

**Note:** This counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's offer. However, it gives him room to negotiate without having to feel like he's losing too much. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to consider dropping my price further, but I'll aim to stay above $9,000 if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $8,000 is the absolute highest I could go.  It's a fair offer considering I have other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000, but it's getting closer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with no other option but to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already on Round 4, and I have limited time before I need to make a decision about John.

**Conclusion:** 

While $8,000 is less than I'd like, it's a reasonable compromise considering the potential risks of further negotiation. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid a potential loss of money if I need to sell to John."
