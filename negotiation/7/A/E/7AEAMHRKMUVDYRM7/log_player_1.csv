Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product at a price of $1,400,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm offering you a chance to acquire it before I open bidding to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000:
    * Provides a significant profit margin for me.
    * Offers Bob a substantial discount, making it very attractive.
    * Creates a sense of urgency (""exclusive opportunity"") to encourage a quick decision. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
