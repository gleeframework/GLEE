"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair market value considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price point.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. This reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, considering our initial discussion. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you've placed on it, and it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum limit. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price.  He can still get the product from John for $1,000,000, so he has leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price point of $1,000,000. With only 5 rounds left, Bob has a limited opportunity to negotiate further.  Since John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum price, it's the most sensible choice for Bob to buy from John at this point."
