"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. This reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, considering our initial discussion. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you've placed on it, and it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
