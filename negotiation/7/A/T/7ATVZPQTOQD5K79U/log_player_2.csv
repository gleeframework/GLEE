"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I will reject Alice's offer because I can buy the product from John for $150, which is still within my budget of $150. I don't want to pay $140 when I can pay $150 for the same product.
