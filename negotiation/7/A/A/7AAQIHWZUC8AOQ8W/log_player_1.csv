"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""substantial benefits"" to justify the high initial price, framing it as a worthwhile investment.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This opening offer helps gauge Bob's interest and sets the stage for a negotiation where I can strategically concede towards a more agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John.  I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming to bring him closer to a price point that's more beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product brings. However, $1,100,000 falls quite short of what I consider a fair deal.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects a significant concession on my end while acknowledging the product's true worth."" ,
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial concession of $300,000 to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and incentivize Bob to move closer to my desired price range.
* **Holding Firm:** I'm still holding firm above my minimum of $1,500,000 to ensure a profitable outcome. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the high price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm also aware of my alternative option (selling to John) and will walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price and provides a profit. While I could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, the difference is now relatively small, and there's a risk that Bob might walk away if I push too hard. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
