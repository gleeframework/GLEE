"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $120 is too high.  While Bob is willing to pay up to $150, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to lower her price since she values the product at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in buying, but I'd be willing to pay $110.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. Considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on $115 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he's still trying to save as much as possible.  There's still room for negotiation, and a counteroffer might get Alice closer to his $110 target.  It's worth a try before resorting to John's offer of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $115 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a compromise that suits both of us. How about we set the price at $114 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $114. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $114
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $114 is only $4 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $110.  While Bob is always aiming to save money, it's getting late in the negotiation.  If he rejects this offer, there's a chance Alice might not budge further, and Bob would end up paying the full $150 to John.  It's better to take this deal and save $36 compared to John's offer."
