Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $10,000 gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to value:** Mentioning Bob's estimated value helps him see the potential benefit of the deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates flexibility, signaling that I'm open to discussing the price further.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've made a good profit and secured the sale. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer. I'll be mindful of my minimum price ($8,000) and the potential profit I can gain.
* **If negotiations stall:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000 to ensure I don't lose the sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher profit:**  While Bob's offer is better than John's, I can potentially get a higher price by continuing negotiations.  
* **Room to negotiate:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my desired price. There's room to counter and potentially reach a more profitable outcome.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer means I'm locking in a profit, but I'm also potentially leaving money on the table. Rejecting gives me a chance to secure a better deal. 

**Next Step:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price of $10,000, while still keeping in mind his willingness to pay $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential deal, $9,000 is a little below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Highlight Value:** I reiterate that the price is still a great deal for Bob, given his estimated value of $12,000.
* **Maintain Profit:** $9,500 is still significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, ensuring I make a decent profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price that's profitable for me. 
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll consider his next counteroffer carefully, keeping in mind my minimum price and the possibility of accepting John's offer."
