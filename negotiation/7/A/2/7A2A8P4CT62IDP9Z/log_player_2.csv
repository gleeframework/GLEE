"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product that's worth a lot to you. I understand it's valued at $15,000, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair for both of us. My offer is $12,500.  This is a great deal for you, and it will allow me to get a good price for the product as well. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
