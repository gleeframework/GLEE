"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a very reasonable price of $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This counter offer aims to be significantly lower than Alice's initial offer while still leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to start low to maximize potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice countered by meeting in the middle. While her offer is lower, it's still above your budget and her product's worth to you.
* **Gradual increase:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate upwards but keeps you firmly below $100.
* **Urgency:**  By expressing your budget and desire to find a solution, you subtly introduce a sense of urgency without resorting to threats of walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $95. It's a steal at this price already. My last offer is $115. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the limit:** Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  While it's her best price, it's still above your maximum budget.
* **John's offer is safer:** Buying from John guarantees you stay within budget.  There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, even with more negotiation. 

It's time to walk away from Alice and secure the product at a price you're comfortable with from John."
