"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $15,000  to start negotiations. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $13,000? That would be a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $13,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500. I hope this price works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I see you're serious about this purchase. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250?  This would be my final offer.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $11,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my limit. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers at $10,375.  Let me know if that works for you.",10375.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, thanks for sticking with me. I know we're both eager to get this done.  How about we settle at $10,500? It's a fair compromise and my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,8,
