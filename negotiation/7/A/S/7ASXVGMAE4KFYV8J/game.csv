"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your potential interest.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe $1,100,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but  $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $980,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",980000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $980,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $840,000?",840000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $840,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap.  I'd be willing to accept $910,000 as my final offer.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",910000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I understand this is a high-value product, and I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. Would you consider $870,000? That's the best I can do.",870000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but that's still a significant difference from what I had in mind. To be frank, I'm getting close to considering other offers. I can come down to $895,000, but this is absolutely my final offer.",895000.0,Alice,7,
