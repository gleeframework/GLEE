Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but  $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $980,000. This feels like a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $840,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap.  I'd be willing to accept $910,000 as my final offer.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but that's still a significant difference from what I had in mind. To be frank, I'm getting close to considering other offers. I can come down to $895,000, but this is absolutely my final offer.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm and unlikely to go much lower.  While she might budge a little more, it's getting risky. You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, saving you at least $95,000 and potentially more if Alice is bluffing.  It's better to take the guaranteed savings at this point."
