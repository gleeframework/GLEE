"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is better than John's offer of $1,500,000, but it's still significantly lower than my desired selling price. I believe there's room for negotiation, so I will reject Bob's offer and present a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, I need to get closer to $1,800,000 for this product. Would you consider $1,800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm coming down from my initial offer but still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer and John's standing offer. This keeps the negotiation active while leaving room for further compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit shy of your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,700,000. Can we agree on this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now offering $1,700,000, which is a significant amount above John's offer of $1,500,000. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,800,000, accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
