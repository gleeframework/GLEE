"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly exceptional and offers great value. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. However, I understand the importance of fair pricing, so I'm extending this exclusive offer to you. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $140? This price not only reflects the true value but also allows us to maintain a competitive edge in the market. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

You can get the product for $120 from John, so it's not worth accepting Alice's offer of $140."
