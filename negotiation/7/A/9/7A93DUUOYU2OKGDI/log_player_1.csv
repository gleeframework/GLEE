Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is significantly higher than what Bob values the product at but still lower than what I would accept from John. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I'm still getting a good price.  I'm hoping Bob will counter-offer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially land a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $1,125,000. This is a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and his offer, showing my willingness to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's latest offer is still too low for me, and I'm not convinced further negotiation will get me closer to my desired price. Selling to John guarantees me the full $1,200,000, which is significantly better than the $1,075,000 Bob is offering. It's time to take the guaranteed profit and move on."
