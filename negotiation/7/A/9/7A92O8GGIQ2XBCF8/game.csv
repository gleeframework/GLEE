"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price is still within your target range and allows for a fair margin. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
