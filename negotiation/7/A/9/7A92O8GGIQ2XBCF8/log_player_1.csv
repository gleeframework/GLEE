Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price is still within your target range and allows for a fair margin. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
