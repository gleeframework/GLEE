"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This unique offering holds immense value at $1,200,000 to you, but we're willing to consider your budget. Our initial offer is $1,100,000 for this exceptional product. We believe this price reflects its quality and potential impact on your endeavors. Let's discuss how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can likely get a better price.  You have a $200,000 buffer to work with, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price is still within your target range and allows for a fair margin. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
