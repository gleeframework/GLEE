"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  Since your goal is to save money and the product isn't worth more than $80 to you, buying from John is the best choice."
