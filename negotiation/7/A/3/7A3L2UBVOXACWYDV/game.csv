"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This offer reflects its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price reflects its true value and gives us both a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
