"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $10000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $14000.  This would be a great deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14000 is still a little too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $12000.  This is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
