{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with an initial offer of $900,000, knowing that the product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the value of the product and the opportunity for Bob to get a good deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I will closely monitor Bob's response. 

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a profitable deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **If negotiations become unproductive:** I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John for $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out on the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but based on my budget, I am only able to offer $850000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Close:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, there's still room for me to negotiate.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can secure a higher price by counteroffering. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident that Bob is genuinely interested in the product. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer now keeps me in a position of power and allows me to potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer, taking into consideration Bob's budget constraints and my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $875,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), ensuring I make a reasonable profit. 
* **Positive and Persuasive:** The message is positive, emphasizing the value of the product and reiterating the fairness of my counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response.  If he accepts, we have a deal! If he rejects, I'll need to reassess my strategy, considering the possibility of either lowering my price further or walking away to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the compromise. Based on my financial situation, I am comfortable with an offer of $860000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $860,000 is only $60,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains are relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing negotiations could drag on, potentially costing me time and opportunity. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the transaction with Bob, ensuring clear terms and a smooth exchange of the product."
