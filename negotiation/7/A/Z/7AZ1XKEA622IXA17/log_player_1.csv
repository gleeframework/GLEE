"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm still holding firm on my minimum but I'm showing flexibility by coming down a bit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $8,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a little closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,800 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm trying to stay firm on my minimum while showing that I'm willing to compromise. I hope this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $7,900, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm getting close to my minimum, but Bob's offer is still too low.  While I want to get the best possible price, I also want to ensure I don't lose too much time.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't have to keep negotiating."
