"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is a bit lower than I anticipated.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get a good deal. How about we settle on $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1050000, which would be $1075000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
