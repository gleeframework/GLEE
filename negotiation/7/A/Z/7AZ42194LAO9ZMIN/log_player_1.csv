Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 to John. Therefore, she should aim for a price higher than that to maximize her profit from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product for $1,200,000 or slightly more to Bob would likely result in him rejecting the offer, as it's at or above his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $1,150,000 creates a potential win-win. It's a significant markup from John's offer, giving Alice a chance for higher profit. Simultaneously, it's below Bob's perceived value, making it a potentially attractive offer for him."
