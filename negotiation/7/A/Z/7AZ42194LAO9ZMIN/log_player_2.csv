"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I would like to {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}.

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, but she is offering it to me for $1,150,000. That's a $50,000 markup. I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is a much better deal."
