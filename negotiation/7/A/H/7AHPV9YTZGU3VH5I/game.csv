,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm not willing to go above $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10200, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9850. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9850.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $9850. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value.
