"Bob, I have a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. It's something I've put a lot of effort into, and I'm confident it would be a great asset for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I know this is a bit above my floor price, but I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10,000. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
