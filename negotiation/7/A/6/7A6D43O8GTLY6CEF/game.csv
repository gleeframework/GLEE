"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. While $1,300,000 is below what I had in mind, I understand your perspective on its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This would represent a significant step from my initial ask and brings us closer to a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
