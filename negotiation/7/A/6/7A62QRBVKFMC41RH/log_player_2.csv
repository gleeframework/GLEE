"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I know it could benefit your business significantly. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great price, and it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500.** This is a good price, but it's still more than you're willing to pay. 
* **John's offer is $10,000.** This is your maximum price. 
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**  You can get the product from John for $10,000, so you can reject Alice's offer and still get the product. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you have the potential to negotiate a lower price with John, or find another seller who might offer a better deal."
