"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way over his budget of $8,000, and he can get the same product from John for less.  He should counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm at $9,000. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11000, which would be $10000. This is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's budget of $8,000.  John is offering the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget and the best deal he can get at this point. There is no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
