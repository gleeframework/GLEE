{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm willing to negotiate, $95 is still too far below my minimum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. Bob has shown that he's unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'd rather take the guaranteed $120 from John than risk another round of negotiations with Bob."
