"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great asset to you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
This is far too high of a price. It's worth rejecting and negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $11,500 is better than $13,500, it's still above my limit.  I'll counter with a lower offer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not comfortable with $11,500.  I can offer $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 9500}
