Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the walk-away point:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, making that your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $1,500,000.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly mention the product's worth to Bob, it emphasizes ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" to encourage him to consider a price closer to your desired range. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's essential to be prepared for Bob to reject the offer. You have a strong fallback option with John."
