Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you recognize its value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and still ensures a profit above John's offer.
* **Confident Language:**  The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value and encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is an ""exclusive opportunity"" could make the offer seem more appealing. 

**It's important to note:** This is just an initial offer. We are prepared to negotiate if Bob counters, but we want to aim high to maximize potential profit."
