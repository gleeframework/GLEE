"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $14,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm asking for $16,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise!"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,500. How about we aim for $15,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $15,250 is higher than John's offer of $15,000.  It's also getting close to my minimum. I'll take it!"
