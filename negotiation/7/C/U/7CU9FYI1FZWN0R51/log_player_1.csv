Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This sets the stage for a negotiation, allowing you to potentially get closer to your ideal price.

Remember, this is just an initial offer. Be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still below the value of the product to you. There's potential to get a better price.  You should reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,100,000? This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable increase:** $1,100,000 is a decent compromise, showing you're willing to negotiate, but still leaving you above your minimum.
* **Emphasize the value to Bob:** Remind him that the product is worth more to him, making this offer still a good deal.
* **Show flexibility and willingness to compromise:**  This builds trust and keeps the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,050,000. This still allows for a reasonable savings for me while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for you.  It's above your minimum and still allows you to earn a reasonable profit. There's a good chance that further negotiation with Bob could lower the price, but the risk of him walking away or you needing to sell to John at your minimum is too high. Accepting this offer guarantees a good outcome."
