Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, it's still above what John is offering. There's room to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down closer to $8,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $7,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm offering the product to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your target price of $8,000, which is the same price John is offering.  There's no further benefit to negotiating or going with John."
