Round 2

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, $925,000 is a good compromise and secures a sale. It's also significantly better than selling to John for $800,000."
