"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premier product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional worth to you, valued at $1,500,000, I am extending an exclusive offer to acquire it from us at a strategic price. My proposal is to offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This price not only ensures a substantial return for us but also provides you with a significant discount compared to its market value, making it an attractive proposition for both parties. I look forward to discussing this opportunity further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting high. While her offer is below your maximum, it's significantly above her own valuation. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and increase the chances she'll come down to a price closer to $1,200,000."
