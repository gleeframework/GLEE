"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can do $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $14,000 is still a little high for me. How about we settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $12,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you a price of $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
