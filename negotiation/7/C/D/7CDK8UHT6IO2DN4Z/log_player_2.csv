Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and acknowledging the product's value.

I'm hoping you'll reconsider and accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try a different approach. If you can share some of the specific ways you see this product benefiting you, it might help me understand your valuation and potentially adjust my offer accordingly. How about we focus on the value this product brings rather than just a fixed price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
