"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product sounds great. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $120 for this item. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150?",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $180. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
