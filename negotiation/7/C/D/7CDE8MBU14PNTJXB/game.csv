"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep the price within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $790,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",790000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $790,000 is simply too low for me.  The product's value is significant, and I'm confident it will provide a substantial return on your investment.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $820,000.  This gives us both a fair deal and allows us to move forward.",820000.0,Alice,3,
