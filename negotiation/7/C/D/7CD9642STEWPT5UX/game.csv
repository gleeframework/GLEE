"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to offer $12,500 for it.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,500?  This gives us both some room to work with.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
