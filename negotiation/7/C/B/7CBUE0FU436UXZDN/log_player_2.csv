"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000), it's still higher than the price John is offering ($1,000,000). 

Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for a lower price."
