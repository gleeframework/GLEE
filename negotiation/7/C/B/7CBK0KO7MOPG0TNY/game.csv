"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I'm looking for, so I'll make a counteroffer of $100 for the product. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $100 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is my final offer. Let me know if we can reach a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $90, Bob. I think we're getting close, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'll make a counteroffer of $110 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",110.0,Alice,5,
