"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $70. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $70. It is a good deal, but you can try to get it for even less. You will counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point. However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $65? "", ""product_price"": 65}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $72.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $72.5 is a decent price, you still have room to negotiate and potentially save more. You'll counteroffer again and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $70?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 70}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $70. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $73. I think this is a good balance between our initial offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $73. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $73
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $73, which is a decent price. You've already made a few counteroffers and there are only 5 rounds remaining.  It's a good deal and likely you won't get it much lower.  Accepting the offer is the best option to avoid potentially losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
