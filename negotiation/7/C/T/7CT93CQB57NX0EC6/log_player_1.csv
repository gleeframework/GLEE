Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
