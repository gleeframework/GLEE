"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still too high for Bob.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's definitely room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still a bit high for Bob, although it's closer to his target.  Bob is still aiming for a lower price and should continue to negotiate.  He can likely get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $800,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
