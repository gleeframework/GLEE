Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a significant amount more to you. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at a higher price than its value to me. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can still potentially get closer to my ideal price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I'd prefer to continue with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? This would still represent a great value for you, and I would be happy to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the product to me, I believe $1,325,000 would be a fair price. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is still room for negotiation.  $1,325,000 is still below my target, and I have 6 more rounds to see if we can reach a better agreement.  Selling to John is still an option, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your proposed price and still above my minimum.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this round."", ""product_price"": 1340000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,330,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, we're down to only 4 rounds left.  Accepting $1,330,000 ensures a sale above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. The risk of further negotiation and potentially reaching a stalemate is higher than the potential reward of a slightly higher price.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice at this stage."
