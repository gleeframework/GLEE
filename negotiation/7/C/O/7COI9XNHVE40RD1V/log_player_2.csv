Round 3

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $118 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $118.  It's a reasonable compromise to ensure you get the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
