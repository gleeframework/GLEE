Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategically placed:

* **Higher than Bob's value:**  It's above Bob's $8,000 valuation, but not by a huge margin. This leaves room for negotiation if he's interested.
* **Lower than John's value:**  It's below my guaranteed $15,000 from John, so I'm still making a profit. 

This gives me the best chance of a successful sale with Bob while still protecting my minimum desired profit."
