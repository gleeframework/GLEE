Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position.  There's no need to lowball Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering at $1,300,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit above his perceived value.
* **Professional and encouraging tone:** The message aims to be positive and open to discussion, increasing the chances of Bob engaging and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Important Considerations:**

* Bob's negotiation skills and willingness to pay above his perceived value are unknown factors. 
* You might adjust your offer based on Bob's response and any information you gather during your interaction."
