{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're not leaving money on the table.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:**  It leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** You've established a price point to start the negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit outside my budget. I could consider purchasing it for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While selling to John for $1,200,000 is an option, it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal with Bob. 

You can make a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price point, but still leaves room for compromise.  It's a gamble, but the potential for a higher sale price is worth the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for well below its value to you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. Would you consider $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still a bit lower than your desired outcome.  The potential for a higher price with a counteroffer is worth the risk.  Remember, John is waiting in the wings if negotiations with Bob fall through completely."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $1,212,500. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a very good deal for you, considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1212500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I can do $1,190,000. This is a fair offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,190,000 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still risky to keep negotiating. It's likely that the negotiation could continue to go back and forth, and there's no guarantee that you'll be able to get a price that you're happy with. 

John is offering a safe and guaranteed price of $1,200,000, which is very close to your minimum.  Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point.  You're not losing out on much money, and you're securing a sale."
