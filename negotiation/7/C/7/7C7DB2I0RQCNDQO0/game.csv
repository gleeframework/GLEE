"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for well below its value to you. Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $1,212,500. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a very good deal for you, considering the product's value.  What do you say?",1212500.0,Alice,5,
