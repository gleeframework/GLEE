Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and Bob is still unwilling to meet my minimum price. Although I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk going another round with Bob and potentially lose out on a sale. It's time to secure the deal with John for $15,000."
