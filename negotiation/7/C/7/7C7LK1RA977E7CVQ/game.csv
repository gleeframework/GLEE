,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this product.  Let's keep the negotiation going.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I can do $1,150,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply too far off. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $1,200,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
