,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to get a reasonable price.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
