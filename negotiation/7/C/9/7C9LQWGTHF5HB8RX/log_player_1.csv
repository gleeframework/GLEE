"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, leaving room for negotiation while still being above my minimum of $100.
* **Friendly approach:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I leave room for Bob to counteroffer, but the initial price sets a high starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $115? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $115 is below my minimum of $100. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **More rounds left:** I have 8 more rounds to work with, so I can afford to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer in the middle:** I'm proposing a price in the middle of my desired range ($130) and Bob's offer ($115). This shows I'm willing to compromise while also being fair to myself.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value Bob will get from the product, encouraging him to see the worth in paying slightly more.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $122.50 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle again at $120?  This is my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Bob has come up significantly from his initial offer, and his offer of $120 is very close to my desired range.
* **Final offer:**  Bob has declared this his final offer, which means further negotiation might be futile. 
* **Time is ticking:** We are already in Round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a potential sale by continuing to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:** While $120 isn't ideal, it's still a significant profit and a good deal considering Bob's initial offer. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price, ultimately maximizing my earnings."
