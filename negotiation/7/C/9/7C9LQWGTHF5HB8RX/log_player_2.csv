"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $130 is a decent price, he can potentially get it for less. It's worth seeing if Alice will negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $115? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. $122.50 is closer to his goal, but he can likely get it for less. He's still better off rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $122.50 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle again at $120?  This is my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}
