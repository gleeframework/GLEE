"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you an offer of $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
