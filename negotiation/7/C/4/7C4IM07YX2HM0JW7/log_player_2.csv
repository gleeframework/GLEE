"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $100. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $120 and Alice is offering it for $100. While this is a good deal, it's always better to try to get a better price. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth seeing if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
