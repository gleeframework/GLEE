"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true market value and the return I'm seeking. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,000,000. This price reflects its unique qualities and the value it brings.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good return, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. Let's try to bridge the gap a bit more. How about $700,000?  That's a significant investment on my part and recognizes the value this product brings.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $700,000 is closer, but I need to be realistic about the value this product represents. Let's settle this right now: $900,000, and we have a deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
