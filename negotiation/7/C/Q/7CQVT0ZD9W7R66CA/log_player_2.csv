Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true market value and the return I'm seeking. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,000,000. This price reflects its unique qualities and the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good return, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. Let's try to bridge the gap a bit more. How about $700,000?  That's a significant investment on my part and recognizes the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $700,000 is closer, but I need to be realistic about the value this product represents. Let's settle this right now: $900,000, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly lower than John's offer within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at John's price."
