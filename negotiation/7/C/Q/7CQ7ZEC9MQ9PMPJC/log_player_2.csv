# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum price and what John is offering. Buying from John is the best option in this scenario."
