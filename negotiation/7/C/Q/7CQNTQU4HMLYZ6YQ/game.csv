,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can do $115, but that's as low as I can go.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about $110? That's a good compromise, and I'm really interested in this product.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, so I'll try to meet you there too. I can do $112.50, but that's as close as I can get to $110 without losing money.",112.5,Alice,5,
