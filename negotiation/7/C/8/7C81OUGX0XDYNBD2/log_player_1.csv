Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is close to my ideal price but still leaves room for negotiation. This sets a high bar and allows me some leeway in concessions.
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product. This primes Bob to consider its worth and potentially justify a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is not my absolute ""walk-away"" price.  This allows for flexibility in case Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get this product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, the fact that he made a counteroffer indicates he's still interested. There's room to negotiate a more favorable price.
* **John is the Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's low offer.  If the negotiation doesn't go my way, I have a secure backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still reflects the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my minimum.  My message emphasizes the value of the product as a way to justify the price.
* **Show Flexibility:**  By coming down from my initial offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This can encourage Bob to come up a bit.
* **Room for More Negotiation:** This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiations if Bob isn't willing to meet this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. How about $1,250,000? This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's a significant profit and a good outcome for me.
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's unlikely I'll get much higher than this.  The risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential for a slightly better price.
* **John is Still an Option:** If negotiations with Bob completely fall apart, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, so this is not a desperate move.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or a lower price."
