# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still reflects the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.

Bob is still trying to save money.  He can potentially get the product for less than $1,300,000. Rejecting Alice's offer gives him another opportunity to negotiate."
