"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $100?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That would be a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll still find it a great value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from $120 to $105, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. I'm still a bit hesitant at $90, as it's not quite where I need to be. Would you be willing to pay $95? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it would help me reach my desired price point.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $95 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $95.  Let's compromise at $94. This is a fair price that's closer to my desired price point and still within your budget.  What do you think?",94.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",90.0,Bob,8,
