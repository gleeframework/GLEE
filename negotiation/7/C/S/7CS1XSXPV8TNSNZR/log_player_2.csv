"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal.  While your offer is tempting, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:** At $1,050,000, Alice's offer is still cheaper than buying from John.
* **Alice's offer is final:** This means there's no guarantee of a better price in further negotiation. 
* **Saving potential:** While Bob would have liked to pay even less, accepting Alice's final offer still saves $150,000 compared to buying from John. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision at this point."
