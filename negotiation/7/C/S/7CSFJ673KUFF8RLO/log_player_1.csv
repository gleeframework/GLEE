Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,500 as possible, as this is the most she can hope to gain before it's more profitable to sell to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  Phrasing the offer as ""a great deal"" and emphasizing the product's value to Bob might make him more inclined to accept. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, Alice increases the likelihood of a sale while still securing a significant profit."
