,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $13,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $13,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $14,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market conditions.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $14,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $13,750. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13750.0,Bob,6,
