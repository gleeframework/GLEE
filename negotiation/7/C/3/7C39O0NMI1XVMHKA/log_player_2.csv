"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal, you can potentially get the product for a lower price. By rejecting, you can start negotiating and potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However,  $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is a good deal considering the product's value to you is $800,000.  Accepting this offer saves you $75,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
