Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy it for $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential negotiation and a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still provides a significant profit margin for you (Alice). It's also a price that might be very tempting for Bob, as it's considerably less than he values the product.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
