**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is overpriced:**  Alice is clearly inflating the product's value to you. While it might be worth $1,200,000 to you in the sense that you wouldn't pay more, you can get it for less.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer.  Alice knows you have an alternative and might be willing to lower her price to make the sale."
