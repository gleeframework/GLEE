"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd love. My asking price is $17,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $17,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to establish a good rapport. 
* **Open Ended:**  My message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe $12,000 would be a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **More negotiation room:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob in hopes of achieving a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and I'll accept $14,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product, I think $13,000 would be a fair price for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While I could sell to John, I see potential for a higher price with Bob. He's shown willingness to compromise, and I'm confident I can push him further.
* **Time is on my side:** We still have several rounds remaining, giving me the opportunity to make counteroffers and see if Bob will raise his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,000 isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a great deal for you, considering the product's worth, and it allows me to recoup some of my initial investment."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by decreasing my price again, but it's still above my minimum.
* **Highlight value for Bob:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob by emphasizing the product's worth. 
* **Appeal to shared interests:** I'm referencing ""both of us"" to suggest a win-win scenario and encourage a collaborative spirit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer and think $13,500 would be a reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of going lower:**  While Bob's offer is closer, there's a risk that if I reject it, he might not increase his offer further in the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and secures a profitable outcome. 

While it would be ideal to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price is too high at this point.  Selling to John ensures I don't lose out on a good deal."
