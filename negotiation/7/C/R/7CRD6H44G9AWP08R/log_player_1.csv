{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but not too high to be immediately rejected. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is significantly below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great price for this product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 125}
