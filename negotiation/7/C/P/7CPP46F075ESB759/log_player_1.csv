I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but it also leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for something closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable middle ground and agree to the deal."

Bob's counteroffer of $13,000 is very close to my ideal price. While I'd love to push for even more, the risk of him rejecting again and me having to sell to John for $10,000 is too high.  I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale."
