"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $999000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to your maximum, it's still possible to get a better deal.  There's no harm in rejecting the initial offer and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, and this product does sound interesting. However, I'm looking to stay under $900,000 for this purchase. Would you be willing to consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $950000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better offer than the initial $999,000, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower before considering buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $925000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $935000. This is as low as I can go, considering the value it holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $935,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial price and closer to your desired price point. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not be willing to go lower, and you would be left with the option of buying from John at $1,000,000. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product for a lower price."
