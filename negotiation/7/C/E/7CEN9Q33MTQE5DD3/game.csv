,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $80? That's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
