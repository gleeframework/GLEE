"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for you as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
