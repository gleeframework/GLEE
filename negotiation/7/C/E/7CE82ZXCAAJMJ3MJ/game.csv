"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let me know if you're interested. ",10500.0,Alice,1,
