Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $950,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. However, it leaves room for negotiation while still potentially securing a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no significant time constraints. If you need to sell the product quickly, offering it to John directly might be the best course of action.
* There is a risk that Bob will reject this offer, leading you to sell to John at the original price. However, the potential for a higher profit from Bob makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
