"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm aiming to spend no more than $1,000,000 on this product. Would you consider a price of $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Could we meet halfway at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, it's risky. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower offer, and the negotiation could go on indefinitely. 

Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees Bob the product at his desired price, ensuring the best outcome for his financial goals."
