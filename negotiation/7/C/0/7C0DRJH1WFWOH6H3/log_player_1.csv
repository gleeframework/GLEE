Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't explicitly mention Bob's valuation but implies the product's high value to justify the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is positive and suggests a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob, but I'll accept John's offer of $1,200,000 if the discussions don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm aiming to spend no more than $1,000,000 on this product. Would you consider a price of $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially knowing he's willing to pay $1,050,000.  I'm not ready to accept his offer yet, but I also won't go to John just yet. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Could we meet halfway at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer signals a willingness to compromise but maintains a strong position. It's a common negotiation tactic to encourage agreement.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be and inform my next move."
