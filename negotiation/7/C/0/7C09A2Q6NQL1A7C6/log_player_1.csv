Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  Here's why:

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $10,000, I leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm flexible and willing to work with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
