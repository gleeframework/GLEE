{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's far too early to accept Alice's offer.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but you have plenty of room to negotiate and save more money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

I'm going to start by making a bold counteroffer.  $300,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it shows I'm serious about negotiating. This should get Alice thinking about her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000

Alice's offer is closer, but still too high. I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price."

I'm going to raise my offer slightly to $375,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still want to secure a good deal.  Hopefully, Alice will be more open to negotiation after rejecting my previous offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice is coming down, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll keep pushing for a lower offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to meet Alice halfway and offer $400,000. This shows a genuine effort to compromise and could be the price point where we can finally reach an agreement."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice seems to be stuck at $450,000.  We've only got three rounds left and while I might be able to get a slightly better price, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $450,000 is a good price, significantly lower than John's offer, and I'm confident I'll get a good return on this investment."
