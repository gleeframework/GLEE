"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives me a good margin while still potentially being appealing to Bob. If he rejects, I can adjust based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $160. This is a compromise, moving halfway between Bob's offer and my initial price. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $155. This is only $5 more than Bob's last offer, but it's still above my minimum price and might be enough to convince him.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, so I need to make a decision soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $2 less than what John would pay.  This is getting close to my minimum price, and there's no guarantee that I can get more with a counteroffer.  I'm going to accept and close the deal."
