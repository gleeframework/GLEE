"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $85?  That's still a great price for such a fantastic product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77?",77.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $77 is still a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference - $81? I'm sure you'll agree this is a great price for a product you value at $100!",81.0,Alice,5,
