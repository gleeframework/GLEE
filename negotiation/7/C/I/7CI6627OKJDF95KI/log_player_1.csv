Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $85?  That's still a great price for such a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 85}
