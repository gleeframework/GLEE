**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000.

By offering the product to Bob at $1,150,000, you are:

* **Aiming Higher than John:**  You're trying to get more than your guaranteed price from John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Bob might try to negotiate down, but you have some buffer to still reach your minimum. 
* **Providing Value to Bob:**  While above his valuation, the price offers Bob a potential profit opportunity if he can leverage the product effectively.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer.  However, since you have a backup offer, it's worth trying to maximize your profit."
