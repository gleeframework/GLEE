"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,175,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,175,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  I'm prepared to pay $1,125,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
