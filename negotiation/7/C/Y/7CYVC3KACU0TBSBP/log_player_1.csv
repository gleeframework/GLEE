Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while I have another interested party, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to purchase it.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we could sell the product to John for the full $1,200,000, there's an opportunity to potentially make even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:**  Mentioning that we have another interested party subtly creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

This initial offer aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  See if he's willing to engage in a negotiation at a price point significantly above his perceived value.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts or counters close to our asking price, we secure a higher profit than selling directly to John."
