"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but not the full $15,000.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a good price.  It also gives me a sense of where he's willing to meet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is still too low for me, and I think I can do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but not by much. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate for a sale.  I think $13,000 is a fair compromise, and hopefully he'll agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm confident I can get closer to my initial offer.  Let's see if I can get a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only by $500. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and it's clear that he's not willing to meet my price. While I would prefer to get $15,000, I'm not going to risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
