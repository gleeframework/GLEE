"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price. I'd be willing to pay $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $15,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $19,000 is still above my maximum. Let's try $17,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for sticking with me.  I'm motivated to sell, but need to land on a price that makes sense for me. Would you be willing to do $18,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to get this deal done.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my budget, and  I'm willing to offer $16,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",16500.0,Bob,6,
