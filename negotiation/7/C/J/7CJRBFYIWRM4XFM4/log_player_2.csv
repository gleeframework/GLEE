Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $15,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for sticking with me.  I'm motivated to sell, but need to land on a price that makes sense for me. Would you be willing to do $18,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to get this deal done.
