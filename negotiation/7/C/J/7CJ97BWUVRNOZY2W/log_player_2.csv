```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $8000. This is the lowest I can go, as it's still below my minimum value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's offer of $8,000 is within Bob's budget, and is actually the same price as what John is offering.  It's a good deal, and Bob should accept it."
