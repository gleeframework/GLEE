"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $7500 right now.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $8000. This is the lowest I can go, as it's still below my minimum value. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,3,
