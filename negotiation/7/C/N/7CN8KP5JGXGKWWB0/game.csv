"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $925,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
