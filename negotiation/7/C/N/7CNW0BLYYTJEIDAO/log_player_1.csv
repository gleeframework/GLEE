"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. I understand the product is valuable to you, but this is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's far below what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great price for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. This is a fair compromise, let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This is a sincere offer, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's a good increase from his last offer, it's still below what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 to make this work.  This is a good compromise for both of us - you get a great product, and I get a fair price.  Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,200,000. I'm feeling more optimistic about reaching an agreement.  However, I'm still limited by my budget and can only offer $1,150,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering your need to sell and the product's value to me.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  I'm still not happy with that price, and I feel like we can get closer to a deal that works for both of us.  I'm going to see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair price for the product, and it's a good compromise for us both.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1175000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're almost there. I'm willing to offer $1,125,000.  This is a very fair price for both of us, given the value of the product to me and your need to sell. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. Let's close the deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, we're running out of time.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and move on.  It's not ideal, but it's a solid outcome."
