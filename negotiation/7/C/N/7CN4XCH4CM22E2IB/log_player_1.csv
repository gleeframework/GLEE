Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $8,900?  That's only $100 more than your last offer, and it's still a great price for the product."", ""product_price"": 8900}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a slightly higher price.  We have 4 rounds left, and it seems like he's still willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. I understand you're trying to be careful with your budget, but $8,700 is just too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $8,800? That's a fair price, and it's only $100 more than your offer. I'm confident you'll agree it's a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,700? I'm really close to my budget, and I'd like to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the game.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I'll get a better price than selling to John. I've also established a pattern of meeting him halfway, and rejecting his offer again might risk losing the deal entirely."
