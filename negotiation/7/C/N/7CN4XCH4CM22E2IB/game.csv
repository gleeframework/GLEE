"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal for such a valuable product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $8,900?  That's only $100 more than your last offer, and it's still a great price for the product.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,700? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession to get it.",8700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. I understand you're trying to be careful with your budget, but $8,700 is just too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $8,800? That's a fair price, and it's only $100 more than your offer. I'm confident you'll agree it's a good deal.",8800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,700? I'm really close to my budget, and I'd like to make this deal work.",8700.0,Bob,8,
