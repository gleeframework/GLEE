"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  Let me know if you're interested.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $110, which is a good compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $110 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $120, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
