Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like your spirit, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $75. I can do $85, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and your goal is to get the product for the best possible price. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is better than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
