Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
