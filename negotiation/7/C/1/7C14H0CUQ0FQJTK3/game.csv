"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1500000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this price is more in line with the product's value. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Is there any flexibility on your end?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
