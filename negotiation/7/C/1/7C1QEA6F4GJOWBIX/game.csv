"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a price closer to $6,000 to make it work. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but $6,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $7,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but we are still quite far apart. I'm willing to come up to $7,500.  However, I need to be realistic - if we can't find an agreement close to this number, I'll need to consider other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the midpoint between your last offer and my minimum price. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,7,
