Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't accept less than $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, you should aim for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation to increase the chance of a sale. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $11,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.

**Why this strategy is better than others:**

* **Offering close to $8,000:** This leaves a lot of potential profit on the table.
* **Offering exactly $12,000:** Bob has no incentive to accept since he gains nothing.
* **Going above $12,000:** Bob will definitely reject the offer."
