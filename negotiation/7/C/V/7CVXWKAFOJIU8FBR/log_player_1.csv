"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Room for compromise:** There's a $20 gap between my offer and Bob's value, allowing for a few rounds of counteroffers. 
* **John as an alternative:**  Knowing John will pay $120 gives me a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for improvement:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value ($120), but there's still room to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better price. 
* **Time remaining:** With 9 rounds left, I have time to explore other options.

I'll send a counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you coming up to $90.  I'm still looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $95?  It's a fair price, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum value of $120, but it's a significant step closer to my desired price.
* **Demonstrating flexibility:** The counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while also communicating that I'm not willing to accept the first offer.
* **Time pressure:**  The message subtly hints at a desire to close the deal, which could encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining John's option:**  John's offer remains my safety net, but I'm still working to maximize my profit from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I am willing to pay $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in:**  Bob's offer of $92 is only $3 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120. This is a significant step closer and puts me in a favorable position.
* **Time constraint:** With 6 rounds remaining, there's a risk of further negotiation driving the price down. It's important to consider the potential cost of continued negotiation vs. securing a good deal now.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially get a higher price, there's also a chance that Bob might drop out or make a counteroffer that's even lower. Accepting his offer minimizes this risk and guarantees a sale.

I'm willing to take this offer and avoid the potential for a lower price later on."
