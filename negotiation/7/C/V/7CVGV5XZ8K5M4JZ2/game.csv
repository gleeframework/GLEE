"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle, how does that sound?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to save some money on this purchase.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,200. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  Let's try to close this deal - what do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,900. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.",9900.0,Bob,6,
