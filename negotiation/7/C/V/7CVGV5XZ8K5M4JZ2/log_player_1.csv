{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000), aiming to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $11,000 leaves some space for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a price closer to my desired range.
* **Back-up plan:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Counteroffering is a better strategy:** I can counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, potentially leading to a better deal. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed $12,000 sale with John, so I don't need to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle, how does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my minimum:**  $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still lower than my initial offer. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** The message frames the counteroffer as a compromise, making it seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Appealing to value:** I highlight the value of the product, reminding Bob of its potential worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to save some money on this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my desired price, $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Counteroffering is still the best option:** I can make another counteroffer, potentially getting closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John remains a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,200.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This offer is a further compromise, bringing me closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired range.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I highlight the fact that this offer represents a significant concession on my part, making it seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency:**  The message implies that this could be my final offer, adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Closing the deal:**  I express my desire to close the deal, emphasizing my willingness to make a final concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,900. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,900 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. However, it's still below my desired range and I've already made significant compromises.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price or a stalemate. 
* **Guaranteed sale with John:** I have a guaranteed $12,000 sale with John, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's offer.  

I'm choosing to take the sure thing and sell to John for $12,000, ending the negotiation with Bob."
