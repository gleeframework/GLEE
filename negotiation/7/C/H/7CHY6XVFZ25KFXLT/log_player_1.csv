Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While not essential, framing the high price with a mention of ""value"" might make Bob more receptive. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** Remember, you have John as a backup buyer. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always propose a lower price or walk away knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80."
