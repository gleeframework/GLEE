Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $119. I believe it's a great deal, but let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still ensuring you get a good price. 
* **Psychology:** The slightly below $120 price might make Bob perceive it as a better deal than a rounded $120.

**Important:** If Bob counter-offers, you should accept any amount he offers above $120.  You have nothing to lose by doing so, and you might even make a slightly higher profit."
