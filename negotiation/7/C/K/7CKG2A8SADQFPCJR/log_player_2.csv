"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be very valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John. It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice first, potentially saving even more money."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,000 is a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget of $12,000. He can get the product for that price from John, so it's in his best interest to keep negotiating with Alice or buy from John."
