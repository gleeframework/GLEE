"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but we're willing to start negotiations at $110. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Alice's starting price is a bit high. I'm willing to negotiate to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. How about we meet in the middle at $100?

Alice meeting in the middle at $100 is a good deal. It's unlikely I'll get a much better price, and it's still a decent saving compared to John's offer."
