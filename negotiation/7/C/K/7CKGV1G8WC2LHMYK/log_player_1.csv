"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value it provides. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic:** I'm hoping Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his initial assessment.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response and my desire to close the deal before I need to turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:** $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a huge loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There are still 8 rounds left. I have time to explore potential counteroffers and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is the last resort:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, I want to see if I can maximize my earnings through negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still less than my initial asking price. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlight Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this price is a ""good deal for both of us"", appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially encouraging him to meet me halfway. 
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation amicable, hoping to avoid any escalation that could lead to a breakdown in negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to consider if I need to drop my price further or if I'm better off selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $7,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, there are still 6 rounds left. There's an opportunity to push for a better deal. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, but I'm not yet convinced I can't get a better price from Bob with more negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again in Round 5, potentially offering a price slightly higher than $7,500. I'll continue to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $7,500 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal without needing to go through more rounds."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm proposing a price that is closer to Bob's last offer but still higher. This shows that I am willing to compromise, but not at the expense of a significant loss.
* **Emphasizing efficiency:** I mention that agreeing to $9,000 will allow us to ""close this deal without needing to go through more rounds."" This highlights the potential for both of us to save time and effort. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I continue to use a friendly and encouraging tone,  hoping to keep the negotiation productive.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy.  I might need to consider dropping my price further or explore selling to John if it becomes clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $8,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $8,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable value, but it's getting closer. I'm hesitant to accept it yet, but it's not a terrible deal.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're now down to 4 rounds. The pressure is on to make a decision.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  If I reject this offer, Bob is claiming it's his ""final offer."" However, there's a chance I can still push for a higher price in the remaining rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer in Round 7, aiming for a price between $8,000 and my minimum value of $15,000.
* I'll consider the remaining rounds and Bob's commitment to his ""final offer"" before making my decision. 
* If Bob is firm on $8,000, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in Round 8 or 9 to ensure a good profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $10,000. This product is truly valuable, and $10,000 is a fair price that reflects its worth. We've both made compromises, and this price is a win-win for both of us.  Let's close this deal now. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm on value:**  I'm not willing to go below $10,000 because that's still closer to my minimum acceptable value than Bob's offer of $8,000.
* **Highlighting the win-win:**  I emphasize that this price is a ""win-win"" for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency and Closure:** I'm pushing for a quick resolution by saying ""Let's close this deal now."" This creates a sense of urgency and might incentivize Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll assess Bob's response very carefully. If he rejects, I'll have to make a difficult decision in Round 8.  
* If I believe I can get closer to $10,000 with Bob, I'll counteroffer again.
* If I don't think I can get a better deal, I'll likely sell to John in Round 8 or 9 to ensure a profit."
