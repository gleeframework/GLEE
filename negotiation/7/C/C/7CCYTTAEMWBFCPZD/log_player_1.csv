{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I'm willing to sell it for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.

By offering the product at $119, I am:

* Giving Bob a small incentive to buy now rather than miss out.
* Still making a significant profit above Bob's valuation.
* Leaving only $1 on the table compared to my alternative sale."
