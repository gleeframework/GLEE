"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for $25000 for it. I think you'll find it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $18000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $18000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $22000. This is my best price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. $19500 is still a bit shy of my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering $21000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",21000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm sorry, Bob, but I've already made one concession too many. I'm not willing to go any lower than $21000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to hold out for the best price, and I'm not willing to sell for $19000.",21000.0,Alice,7,
