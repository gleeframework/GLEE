# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly exaggerating the product's value to you. While it might be worth $1,500,000 to you in a best-case scenario, you know you have the option to buy it from John for that price.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a counter-offer. She knows you have an alternative and is likely to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
