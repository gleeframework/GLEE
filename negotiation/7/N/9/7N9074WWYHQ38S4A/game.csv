"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in your product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the potential of the product while also being within your budget. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1150000. This is a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1150000 is still below what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. I'm offering $1200000. It's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
