"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that I know you value highly, and I'm confident it would be a great addition to your collection. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you'd prefer to pay less, $110 is still a better price than $150.
* **You value the product.** You're willing to pay up to $150, so anything below that is a good deal for you."
