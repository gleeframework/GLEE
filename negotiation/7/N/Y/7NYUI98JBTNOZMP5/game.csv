"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a solid margin and me a good return. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This price still allows you a good profit, and it's a step closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay. This would give you a good return and would be a reasonable price for me. Let's see if we can agree on this.",950000.0,Bob,4,
