Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a solid margin and me a good return. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's estimated value of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Benefit for Bob:** I'm emphasizing that this offer is still a good deal for Bob, giving him a profit margin. This makes the offer more appealing and increases the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question, encouraging Bob to engage in further discussion. This keeps the door open for negotiation and prevents a quick rejection.

**Important Considerations:**

* I'm willing to negotiate, but I will not go below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  If Bob's counteroffers fall below this, I'll switch to John.
* I'll keep John's offer in mind throughout the negotiation process. This helps me make informed decisions about whether to accept Bob's counteroffers or hold firm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer was low, he's shown a willingness to negotiate. There's a chance we can find a middle ground.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation. I can now counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $900,000 but lower than my original offer of $1,200,000. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests. 
* I will continue to monitor John's offer as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob become unproductive, I'll be ready to accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This price still allows you a good profit, and it's a step closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000.
* **Fair Value:** I believe $1,050,000 is a fair price that still gives me a significant return while allowing Bob a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm using language that suggests a willingness to continue negotiating and find a solution that benefits both parties. 
* **Pressure for Acceptance:** By lowering my price, I'm putting some pressure on Bob to accept. This is especially important since I'm willing to go to John if necessary.

**Important Considerations:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I will consider the possibility of accepting John's offer of $1,500,000. 
* I will need to be careful not to drop my price too low too quickly, as this might make Bob think I am desperate for a sale and encourage him to offer even lower prices."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay. This would give you a good return and would be a reasonable price for me. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is unlikely to succeed:** Bob is unwilling to budge much further, and his offer is well below what I need to get.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, which is a significantly better outcome for me.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sacrifice my minimum profit margin.  John's offer gives me the best return on my product, so it's the most sensible choice."
