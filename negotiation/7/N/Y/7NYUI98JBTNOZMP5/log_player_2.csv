"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a solid margin and me a good return. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a good deal for her, it's not within my budget of $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This price still allows you a good profit, and it's a step closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I want to see if I can get her closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer again and try to negotiate a better deal."
