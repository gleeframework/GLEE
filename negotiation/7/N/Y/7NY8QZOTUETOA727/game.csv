"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield significant returns.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I see the potential of this product, $2,000,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm open to negotiation but need to see a price that reflects the product's worth. How about $1,800,000? This offer represents a substantial discount from my initial asking price and could be a profitable venture for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise that allows us both to potentially benefit from this deal.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
