"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the value I know it holds for your business."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, I'm still confident we can reach a price closer to my initial offer. Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests the product holds value for him, so I'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I respect your position. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,900,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, while also recognizing the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go down to $1,750,000. I believe this is the maximum I can afford, and I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for more,  accepting Bob's offer of $1,750,000 makes the most sense at this stage. It's a significant amount that exceeds my minimum, and continuing the negotiation might risk losing the sale altogether."
