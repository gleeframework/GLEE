"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the value I know it holds for your business.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I respect your position. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,900,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, while also recognizing the value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go down to $1,750,000. I believe this is the maximum I can afford, and I hope you can meet me halfway.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
