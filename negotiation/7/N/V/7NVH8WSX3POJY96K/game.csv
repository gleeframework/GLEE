"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done some research and understand its value to you is around $1,500,000. However, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market conditions. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you place on the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous one.  I'd like to offer you $1,012,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1012500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,012,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
