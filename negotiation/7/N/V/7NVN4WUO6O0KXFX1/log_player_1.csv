Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed floor price of $1,500,000 with John. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while acknowledging the potential risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Higher Potential Profit:**  A higher price means a larger potential profit for me.
* **Testing the Market:**  By offering a price higher than John's offer, I'm gauging Bob's perceived value of the product.
* **No Loss Scenario:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out. 

However, there's a risk that Bob might find the price too high and reject the offer.  This is a calculated risk, and the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk in this scenario."
