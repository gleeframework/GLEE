{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Just below your guaranteed price:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price might entice Bob while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" and ""return on investment"" aims to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential gain. 
* **Open for discussion:**  The tone remains collaborative and open to hearing Bob's perspective, potentially leading to a quicker agreement.

By setting a high but reasonable initial offer, Alice maximizes her potential profit while leaving room for negotiation with Bob."
