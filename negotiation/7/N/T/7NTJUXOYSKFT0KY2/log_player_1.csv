"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm also leaving room for negotiation if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can still get more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a price that reflects the value of the product to me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. We're getting closer to a deal, and $1,250,000 is a good price. I don't want to risk pushing Bob away further and potentially ending up with John's offer, which is significantly lower."
