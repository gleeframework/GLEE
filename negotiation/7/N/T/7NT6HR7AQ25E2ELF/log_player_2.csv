"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly above my budget of $800,000. It's too early in the negotiation to accept, and I have room to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with right now. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $800,000, but I'm afraid that's below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget.  While it's a lower price than her initial offer, I'm not comfortable exceeding my target of $800,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering you a price of $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can see the value in making a deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to getting the best deal possible, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll continue to counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my target of $800,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm committed to making this deal work, and I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, demonstrating my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's find a common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, but I'm still open to negotiations. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering you a price of $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can see the value in making a deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still significantly higher than my target of $800,000. We've been negotiating for a while, and it seems like we're not getting close to a price that works for both of us. With only a few rounds left, I'm concerned that we won't reach an agreement.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000."
