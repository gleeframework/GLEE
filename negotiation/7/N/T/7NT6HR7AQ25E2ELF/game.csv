"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with right now. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $800,000, but I'm afraid that's below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering you a price of $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can see the value in making a deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm committed to making this deal work, and I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, demonstrating my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's find a common ground and close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, but I'm still open to negotiations. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering you a price of $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can see the value in making a deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
