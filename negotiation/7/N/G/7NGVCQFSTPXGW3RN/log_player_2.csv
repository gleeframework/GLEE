"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's more than double your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000.  This is a strong opening counteroffer that shows I'm serious about buying but also establishes my price limit.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above my budget.  I'll continue to negotiate with her to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still remain firm about my budget. It's a compromise that could potentially get Alice to accept, especially considering she's already lowered her price once."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $16,000 is still too high. I'm going to reject her offer and try one more time to negotiate a lower price.  If Alice doesn't budge, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to make a final attempt to reach a compromise.  $12,000 is a reasonable offer, splitting the difference between our last two proposals. This demonstrates my willingness to meet her halfway. If she rejects this, I will go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still too high. I'm running out of rounds and am unlikely to get a better offer from Alice.  At this point, buying from John for $8,000 is the best option to get the product within my budget."
