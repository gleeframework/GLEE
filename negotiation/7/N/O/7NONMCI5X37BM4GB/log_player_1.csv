Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. 
* This is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob still gets a good deal. 
* Bob would still make a profit of $100,000 if he accepts, which is likely enough to incentivize him.
* If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing a profit of $1,000,000."
