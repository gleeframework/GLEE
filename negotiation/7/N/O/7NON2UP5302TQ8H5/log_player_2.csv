"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that while still allowing me a healthy profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($10,000). Bob should try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $13,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This would still give you a decent profit and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($10,000). Bob should continue to negotiate and try to secure a lower price. He can still potentially save money by pushing further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to make a profit on this.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's meet halfway and close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($10,000).  Bob has already shown he's willing to compromise, and it's likely Alice will be open to another counteroffer. There's still potential to save more money by pushing for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can come to an agreement if we both show flexibility."", ""product_price"": 12000}
