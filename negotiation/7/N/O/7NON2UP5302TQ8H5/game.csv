"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that while still allowing me a healthy profit. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $13,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This would still give you a decent profit and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal!",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to make a profit on this.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's meet halfway and close this deal!",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can come to an agreement if we both show flexibility.",12000.0,Bob,6,
