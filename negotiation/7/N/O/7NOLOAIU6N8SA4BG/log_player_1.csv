Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $120 and gives Bob some room to negotiate.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not in a rush to sell. I'd prefer to see if I can get a little more.  I'll counteroffer to try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be agreeable to him. I'm still trying to get a little more than my minimum, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob is willing to pay a bit more than $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's only $5 less than my initial offer. I'm going to accept his offer to avoid potentially getting stuck with a lower price or wasting time on further negotiation."
