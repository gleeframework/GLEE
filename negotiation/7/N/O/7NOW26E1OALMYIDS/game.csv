"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I know it's a bit above your value, but it's a great deal and a price I'm willing to negotiate on.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I need to get a little bit higher. I'm willing to come down to $14,250. Let's meet in the middle!",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,6,
