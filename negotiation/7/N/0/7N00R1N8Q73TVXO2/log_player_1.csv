Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Setting the price close to this maximizes potential profit for Alice.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant gain for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to settle for less than $800,000. 

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price from Bob while still being attractive enough to close the deal."
