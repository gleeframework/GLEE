"Bob, I believe this product has significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a major asset to your operations.  I'm offering it to you for $950,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need a price that reflects its potential. How about $900,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to move forward.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still getting a deal that's within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
