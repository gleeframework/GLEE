# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a major asset to your operations.  I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my desire to find the right buyer.  Let me know your thoughts.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  I can try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need a price that reflects its potential. How about $900,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to move forward.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. I'm not yet ready to pay $900,000 when I know it's worth $800,000 to Alice."
