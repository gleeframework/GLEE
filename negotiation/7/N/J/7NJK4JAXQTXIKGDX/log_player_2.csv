"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, it's still more than what the product is worth to Bob. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob begins with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, considering the product's value to Bob and the potential for Alice to make a profit.
* **Open for Discussion:**  The message expresses interest in the product while leaving room for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above value:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  
* **Negotiation continues:**  There's still room for further negotiation. Bob can aim for a price closer to his initial offer, keeping in mind the value to him and the possibility of Alice making a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to finalize the deal closer to my initial offer of $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterate Interest:** Bob reaffirms his interest in the product while maintaining his desired price point.
* **Compromise & Common Ground:**  He acknowledges Alice's compromise but emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable price. This helps keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Maintain Initial Offer:**  By sticking with $8,500, Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also setting a firm boundary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $8800. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a product you value at $10000. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:**  $8,800 is very close to Bob's desired price of $8,500. 
* **Potential Loss:**  Rejecting the offer could lead to further negotiation, but it also risks Alice returning to a higher price or Bob losing the deal altogether.
* **Good Deal:**  $8,800 still represents a significant saving compared to the $10,000 from John, and it's a good deal considering the product's worth to Bob.  

Bob accepts the offer to secure a good price without risking further negotiation."
