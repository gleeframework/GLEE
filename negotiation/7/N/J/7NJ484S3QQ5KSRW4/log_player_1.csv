Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $15,000. However, I'm still limited to $12,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, as I can get the same product from another seller for that amount.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** Bob is firm on his $12,000 offer and even mentions he can get it elsewhere at that price. It's unlikely he'll go higher. Since John offers a guaranteed $12,000, it makes the most sense to cut losses in negotiation time and sell to John."
