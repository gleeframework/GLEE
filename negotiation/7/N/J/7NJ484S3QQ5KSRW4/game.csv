"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $15,000. However, I'm still limited to $12,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, as I can get the same product from another seller for that amount.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
