"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is within your budget, there's room for negotiation. The product is worth considerably less to Alice ($1,200,000) than your maximum price. By rejecting this initial offer and proposing a counteroffer, you can potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer attempts to establish a starting point significantly lower than Alice's initial offer while still leaving room for further negotiation. By proposing a price closer to the middle ground between your maximum and Alice's minimum, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while also aiming for a substantial discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000.  This reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a fair deal.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a price you might consider, but there's still potential for savings.  A difference of $175,000 is significant enough to warrant another counteroffer. You're still well below your maximum budget, and walking away to John is always an option if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $1,325,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer ($1,300,000) and Alice's current offer ($1,375,000).  This shows you are willing to negotiate towards a middle ground, but also holds firm on getting a significant discount. It also keeps the pressure on Alice, as you're still closer to her valuation than yours."
