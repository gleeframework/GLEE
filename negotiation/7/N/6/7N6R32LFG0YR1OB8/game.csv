"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $125. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad you're willing to move closer to my price.  I can accept $130.  That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this now, I'm sure you won't regret it!",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not quite there. I'll meet you at $127.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",127.5,Bob,6,
