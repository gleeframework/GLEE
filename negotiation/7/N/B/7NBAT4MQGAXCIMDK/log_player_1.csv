Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation is helpful, Alice should start with an offer closer to her own value. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""unique value proposition"" without revealing specifics. This encourages Bob to consider its potential worth beyond his initial assessment.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone remains friendly and open for discussion. By asking for Bob's thoughts, Alice encourages a counter-offer and keeps the negotiation moving. 

**Strategy:**

Alice's offer aims to anchor the negotiation closer to her desired outcome. If Bob rejects the initial offer, she can gradually decrease the price, knowing she has John as a guaranteed backup buyer."
