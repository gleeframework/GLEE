Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for the maximum profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite. If he's not, we can negotiate down from there.  If he rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer based on the information I gain about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I believe there's still potential to earn more.  I'm going to make a counteroffer to see if I can nudge him closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but not too much.  $1,500,000 is still a significant profit for me, and it might be enough to entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
