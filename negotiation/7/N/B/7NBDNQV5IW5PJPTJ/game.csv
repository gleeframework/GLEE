This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's continue this dialogue and see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing a clear willingness to negotiate on both sides. While I'm happy to meet halfway, $1100000 is still a bit lower than I can accept.  Let's try $1150000. This is a fair price for the value I'm offering, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
