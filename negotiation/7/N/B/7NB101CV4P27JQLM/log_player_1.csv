Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to go lower, ultimately not going below your $10,000 minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your bottom line.

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit. If you prefer a guaranteed sale, offering a price closer to $10,000 would be a safer approach."
