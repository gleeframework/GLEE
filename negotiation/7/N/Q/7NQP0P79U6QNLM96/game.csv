"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think $950,000 is a bit high, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price. How about we meet at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $810,000?",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in the product, but we're getting into a price range where the difference is becoming less significant. I'm willing to offer $780,000. This is a fair offer, and I hope we can close the deal.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum. I can do $795,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not sure if we can get any closer than that.",795000.0,Alice,7,
