Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and am interested in purchasing it. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $8,500 for the product. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get more from him. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints,  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower your price. Based on my research and understanding of the market, I believe $8,750 would be a fair price for both parties involved. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial target. I'm not yet desperate enough to accept a price this low, especially since I have other options.  I'm confident I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. Based on my current financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $8,800 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable offer for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $8,000.  $8,800 is a decent price, and it's better than risking getting less in the end."
