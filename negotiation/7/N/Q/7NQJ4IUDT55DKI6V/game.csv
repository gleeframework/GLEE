"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and am interested in purchasing it. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $8,500 for the product. Would you consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints,  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it still represents a good value for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower your price. Based on my research and understanding of the market, I believe $8,750 would be a fair price for both parties involved. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
