"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is too high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down significantly? Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. This product is a unique opportunity that I'm confident will yield incredible returns for you. Let's find a compromise - how about we settle for $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm serious about purchasing this, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to be flexible, but we need to find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000? This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
