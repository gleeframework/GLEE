Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is too high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down significantly? Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's good to be flexible, accepting such a low price would mean a significant loss. It's time to counter and see if we can reach a more reasonable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. This product is a unique opportunity that I'm confident will yield incredible returns for you. Let's find a compromise - how about we settle for $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm serious about purchasing this, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but we are still far from an acceptable price. We are getting closer to John's offer, but I believe we can still negotiate a better deal with Bob.  Let's see if we can incentivize him to move closer to our desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to be flexible, but we need to find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000? This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
