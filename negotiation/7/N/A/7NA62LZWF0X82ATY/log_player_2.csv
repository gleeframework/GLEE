Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about $11,200? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,200. Accepting this offer saves $3,800 compared to John's price and is a reasonable compromise."
