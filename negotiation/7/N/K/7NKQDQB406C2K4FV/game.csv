"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $13,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $15,500 to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,500. Can you consider this revised offer?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay that amount.",15000.0,Alice,5,
