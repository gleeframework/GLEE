"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, my budget is limited and I am looking for a price closer to $8000. Could we possibly negotiate towards that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit tight for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11000? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is a step in the right direction, I would like to propose $9500 as a potential compromise. This still allows us to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. How about we meet in the middle again, at $10500? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a good compromise.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal and I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I believe I can't exceed $10000 for this product. Would it be possible to reach an agreement at $10000? This would allow us to both stay within our comfort zones.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we settle on $11500? It's the highest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",11500.0,Alice,7,
