"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for my ideal price. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate but I'm not willing to go below my minimum. I also have John as a backup option, so I have some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$950,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise while maintaining a reasonable expectation for my product's value."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate and still want to maximize my profit. I'll counter with a price closer to my target and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm lowering the price a bit more, but I'm still above my minimum value. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are still too low.  It's getting close to my minimum, but I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal.  John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price, so I'll take it."
