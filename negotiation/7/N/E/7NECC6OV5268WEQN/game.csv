"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't proceed with a price of $1,500,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Would you consider meeting me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe $1,200,000 would be a fair price for the product. Could we possibly meet closer to my budget?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your consistency, but I'm still finding it difficult to meet at $1,200,000.  Perhaps we can find a compromise. How about $1,275,000? This feels like a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
