"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value ($12,000 vs $10,000).**  This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Your goal is to save as much money as possible.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is your worst-case scenario.**  You should only do this if you can't reach a deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm now offering it to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still higher than her value.** She's willing to sell for $13,000, but her value is $10,000.  This means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Your goal is to save money.**  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is still your worst-case scenario.**  Continue trying to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $12,000 is the best price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering it to you for $13,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to your maximum price.**  She's now offering $13,500, which is only $1,500 below your maximum.
* **Continuing to negotiate might be risky.**  You might not be able to get a lower price, and you're already at a point where further negotiation might not be worth it.
* **Buying from John at $15,000 is still better than accepting Alice's offer.**  You'll only be paying $1,500 more, which is a small price to pay for the certainty of a deal.

In this situation, it's better to avoid the risk of further negotiation and go with the guaranteed option from John."
