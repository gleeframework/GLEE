"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My asking price is $1,200,000. Please let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire a valuable asset.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a fair starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still represents a significant gain for you and a good profit for me. Let's work together to close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to the value I've placed on the product.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This would represent a good profit for you and a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
