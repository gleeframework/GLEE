"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make a serious offer to get the deal done. I'm offering the product to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering $1050000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1050000 is still a bit outside my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to go up to $950000. This price reflects the fair market value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the offer to $950000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and my original offer of $1200000. I'm counteroffering $1075000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
