"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to get the best deal possible, and I'm willing to pay $900,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to make a profitable deal."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I can try to get closer to my target price of $900,000 by making another counteroffer.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue exploring better deals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $925,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to maintain a profit margin. I'll sell it to you for $975,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my target price of $900,000.  While I could try to negotiate further,  it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's likely that further counteroffers will result in Alice moving very slowly, if at all. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price that is significantly lower than John's offer, and I still have a few rounds left to explore other options."
