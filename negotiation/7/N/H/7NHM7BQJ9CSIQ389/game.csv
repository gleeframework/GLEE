"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.

This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000.
