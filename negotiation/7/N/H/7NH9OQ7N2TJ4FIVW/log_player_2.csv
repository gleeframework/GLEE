# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12,000. I believe it holds significant value and this price reflects its worth.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It makes sense to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
