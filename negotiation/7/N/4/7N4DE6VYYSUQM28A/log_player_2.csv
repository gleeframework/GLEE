"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $135 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $125, which is $10 less than Alice's offer of $135. This is a reasonable counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is less than John's price, Bob can still do better. Alice is now closer to his desired price, so continuing to negotiate makes sense. He can try a lower counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $130, which is halfway between Alice's current offer of $140 and his previous offer of $125. This shows that Bob is willing to compromise but is still trying to get a better price. It's possible Alice will accept this offer, especially since she rejected his previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $145 is getting closer to John's price of $150.  At this point, the negotiation is getting tiring and there's a good chance Alice will continue to hold firm.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy from John at this point, as it saves time and ensures a purchase without further negotiation."
