Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,600,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring a good profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has increased his offer considerably from his initial $1,400,000, demonstrating his willingness to make a deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations could result in a slightly better price, but also risks Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse.  The certainty of a good deal now outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal later."
