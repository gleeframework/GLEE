Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $150 to Bob provides leverage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially settling somewhere above the minimum price of $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The safety net of selling to John for $100 ensures Alice doesn't have to go below her minimum.

**Why this approach is better than offering a much lower or higher price:**

* **Too Low:** Offering it for $100 or slightly above leaves potential profit on the table.
* **Too High:**  Offering it close to $150 might discourage Bob and lead to rejection, forcing Alice to sell to John for less."
