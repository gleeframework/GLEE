Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward if Bob counters. 
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:**  While we don't explicitly mention John, the fact that we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 gives us a strong bottom line.

By offering the product at $1,450,000, we aim to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
