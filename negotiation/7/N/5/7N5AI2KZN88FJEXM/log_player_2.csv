"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from her valuation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might prompt Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer, getting you closer to your goal of saving money. If her next offer isn't satisfactory, you can always fall back on buying from John for $1,500,000."
