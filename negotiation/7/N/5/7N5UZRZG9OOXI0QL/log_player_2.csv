"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is far too high, and he can get the product for much cheaper from John or by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $8,000 at this time. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. He can still get a better deal by either negotiating further with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our previous offers at $10,000.  This gives you a good profit margin while still allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,500, which is a bit above your offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit too high. Bob can likely negotiate further with Alice or buy from John for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement.  $11,500 is closer, but it's still a bit too much for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value I'm bringing to the table. How about we meet exactly in the middle at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where further negotiation with Alice may be unproductive, and she's unwilling to budge much further. It's time to cut his losses and buy from John for $8,000. This guarantees him the product at his desired price and avoids potentially wasting more time negotiating with Alice."
