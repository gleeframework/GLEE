"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $8,000 at this time. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our previous offers at $10,000.  This gives you a good profit margin while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,500, which is a bit above your offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement.  $11,500 is closer, but it's still a bit too much for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. This would be a good deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value I'm bringing to the table. How about we meet exactly in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,7,
