,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $105. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",85.0,Bob,6,
