"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $800,000. He has plenty of rounds left to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

Bob should start by offering his maximum price. This establishes his upper limit and shows Alice he's serious about making a deal.  It's possible Alice might accept this first counteroffer, but if not, he still has 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob should continue negotiating, as he still has time to potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. This counteroffer demonstrates he is serious about buying the product while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $950,000 is getting closer to his ideal price point, there's still room for negotiation and he has several rounds left to see if Alice will come down further.  The risk of accepting now is that he might regret it if he could have gotten a better price later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

Bob should continue to inch his counteroffers closer to Alice's offers, but not too quickly. By offering $925,000, he shows that he's serious about reaching an agreement while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate. It's possible Alice will accept this counteroffer, but if not, he still has a few rounds left to see if they can find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

With only three rounds remaining, Bob is running out of time to negotiate a better price with Alice.  While she's come down from her initial asking price, she's still asking for $975,000, which is more than Bob wants to pay.  At this point, it's wiser for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000.  This guarantees him the product within his budget and avoids risking further rounds of negotiation with Alice that might not lead to a better price."
