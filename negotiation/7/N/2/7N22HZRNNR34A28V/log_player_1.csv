Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is more than fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob recognizes the value. He saves $50,000 compared to its worth to him ($800,000), and you make a $50,000 profit over your guaranteed sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested but wants a slightly better deal."
