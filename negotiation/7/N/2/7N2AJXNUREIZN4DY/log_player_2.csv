"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000. He needs to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay $8,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, however,  $8,500 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $15,000 is still outside of his budget. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This would be a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and it's a significant improvement from my previous offer. Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
