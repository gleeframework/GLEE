"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay $8,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, however,  $8,500 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This would be a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and it's a significant improvement from my previous offer. Let's try to close this deal!",10000.0,Bob,4,
