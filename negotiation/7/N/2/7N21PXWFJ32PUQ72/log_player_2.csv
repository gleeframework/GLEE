You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $7,000 is significantly less than I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you consider $9,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,000.  It's time to cut your losses and go with your safe option of John who will sell it to you for $8,000."
