Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still allowing you to make a profit.  Let me know your thoughts on this counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
