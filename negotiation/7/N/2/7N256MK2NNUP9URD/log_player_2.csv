"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's a potential for a better deal. 
* **You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but you want to save as much as possible.**  
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price point.**  

By rejecting, you open the door to a counteroffer, potentially bringing the price down closer to your ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still allowing you to make a profit.  Let me know your thoughts on this counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price range.** While you would ideally pay less, $750,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **There's a good chance that further negotiation won't result in a much lower price.**  Alice has already moved from $800,000 to $750,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. It's risky to continue and potentially lose the deal.

Accepting the offer at $750,000 saves you a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable price considering the product's value."
