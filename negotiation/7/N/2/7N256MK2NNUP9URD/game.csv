"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still allowing you to make a profit.  Let me know your thoughts on this counteroffer.",650000.0,Bob,2,
