,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? It's a fair price considering the product's worth.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $75 still doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to go down to $82. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I've already lowered my initial price. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again?",78.0,Bob,6,
