"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $11,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value I know this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while still allowing me some profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I can only go up to $11500 at this time. This is still a good price for both of us, and it's within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $11,500 is tempting, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $11,500 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12,250. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11900. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $11,900. While it's not my ideal price, it's better than John's offer of $10,000 and we're getting closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to close the deal and avoid further negotiation rounds."
