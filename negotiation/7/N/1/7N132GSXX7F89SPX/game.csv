"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I can meet you in the middle at $16,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I can go. I'm willing to pay $15,500.  I think that's fair, considering the value I'm placing on this product.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $15,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",15750.0,Alice,5,
