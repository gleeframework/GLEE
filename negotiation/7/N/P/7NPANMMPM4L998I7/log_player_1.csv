Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to make the higher price more palatable. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, you've made a significant profit. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything because you can still sell it to John."
