"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to me than that. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but how about $85? This is a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm happy to compromise, though.  How about $82?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $82. I'd be willing to go up to $78, but that's as high as I can go.",78.0,Bob,6,
