"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This still leaves room for both of us to make a profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1300000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is closer, but I need a bit more to make this work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let me know your decision.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
