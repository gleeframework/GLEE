Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $97.5 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'm still not convinced it's a good deal for me.  I'm going to see if I can get Bob to come up a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we meet at $100? This seems like a fair compromise, considering we both want to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round, or consider selling to John if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and go with $97.50. This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you halfway between $95 and $97.50, which would be $96.25. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While $96.25 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  With only two rounds left, I don't have time to continue haggling with Bob and risk ending up with a worse deal.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and allows me to close the deal quickly."
