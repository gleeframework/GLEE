"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price. He can aim for a price closer to Alice's value of $1,200,000 to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to maximize his savings while still securing a deal. Offering $1,300,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation.  This price is also still higher than Alice's value for the product, making it a potentially acceptable offer for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still lower than John's price of $1,500,000, making it the more financially beneficial option for Bob. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there is a risk that Alice will either become unwilling to sell or counter with a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a lower price than John, securing the deal."
