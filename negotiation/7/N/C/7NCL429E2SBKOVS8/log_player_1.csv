Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000 to start our negotiations. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I'm confident this product offers significant untapped potential that makes it worth considerably more. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your belief in the product's potential, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

We're still a ways off from my bottom line, and I'm willing to see if Bob will come up further.  It's too early to settle for $1,350,000 when John is offering $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we bridge the gap a bit further? I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction, reflecting my desire to see this product in your hands."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

Bob is very unlikely to reach my $1,500,000 minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
