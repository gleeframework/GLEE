Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its features and potential. I'm thinking a price of $14,000 would be fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your desire to save, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you consider this price?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I aim to be flexible, I need to be fair to myself as well. Let's settle this now -  $12,500, and I'll agree.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving down in small increments. While $11,000 is a decent profit, we're still in early rounds. Holding firm at this stage might push him closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your negotiation, but I have to be honest, your last offer is a bit too far off for me to consider.  I'm willing to accept $12,250.  Take it or leave it, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12250} 

**Reasoning:**  We are getting close to the halfway point, and I want to signal I'm serious.  This offer is still a significant profit, but the ""take it or leave it"" might push Bob to make a more aggressive counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,750 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly still interested and is making an effort to meet us closer.  While not ideal, $11,750 is a good profit margin and waiting longer risks losing him altogether. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with John's $8,000 offer."
