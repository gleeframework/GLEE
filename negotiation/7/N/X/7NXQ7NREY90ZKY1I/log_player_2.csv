# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite agree to that price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $980,000.
