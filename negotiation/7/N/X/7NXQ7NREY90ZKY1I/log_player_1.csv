Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, accepting $960,000 is a strong deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still making a $160,000 profit over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows us to use the funds sooner.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to haggle might sour the deal and push Bob away. 

Accepting $960,000 secures a favorable outcome for both parties."
