"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price? I am willing to discuss and find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I believe the product's value justifies my initial price, I am willing to come down to $1000000. This still offers you a significant potential return, and I think it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
