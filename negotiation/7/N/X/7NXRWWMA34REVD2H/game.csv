"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $135? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit stretched on $135. Would you be willing to go down to $125?",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $130? It's still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $127.50?",127.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go down to $127.50, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $129? It's still a bit above my minimum price, but I think it's a fair compromise.",129.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget limit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $129. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $128?",128.0,Bob,8,
