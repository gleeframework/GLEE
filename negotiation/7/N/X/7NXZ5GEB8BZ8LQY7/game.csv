"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to accept $10,500 for the product. This price still allows me to get a reasonable return while acknowledging your financial limits.  Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $10,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
