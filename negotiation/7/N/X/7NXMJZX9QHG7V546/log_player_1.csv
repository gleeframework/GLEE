"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's below Bob's perceived value of $150, making it more likely he'll accept. It also gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. While it's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $140. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's the same as his previous offer, I'm hoping he might be willing to go a little higher.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 133}
```

I'm countering with $133. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm still open to negotiation but also that I'm not going to give in too easily. It's also closer to his last offer, hopefully leading to a faster agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  It's getting closer to my minimum price, but I believe we can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. We're getting very close to a deal, and I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation and Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum price.  I'm not sure I can get a higher price from him, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds. Selling to John for $120 is a sure thing, and it's better than taking a chance with Bob and potentially ending up with less."
