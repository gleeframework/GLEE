"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and unique features, I'm confident it's worth more than $100 to you. Let's start our negotiation. How about we aim for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $120. It's important to start negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, given my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I would like to propose an alternative. Given the value of our product, I am willing to meet you halfway at $125. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of the product without exceeding your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still a bit higher than my maximum budget of $120. While it's tempting to accept, I'm only one round away from being able to buy from John for a lower price.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I can afford. Given my budget, $110 is the absolute most I can do. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your financial situation and am willing to consider it. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $115 for the product. This allows me to maintain some profit while still being reasonable for your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still higher than my maximum budget of $120, and we're getting closer to the point where it makes more sense to buy from John.  Since I can buy from John for $120, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice as it's unlikely I'll be able to get her down to my desired price."
