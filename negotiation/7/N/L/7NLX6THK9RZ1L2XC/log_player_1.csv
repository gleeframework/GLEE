Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my target price.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for both of us to make a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
