"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate further. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's not the best possible price. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to lower the price further and save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my target price.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for both of us to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is still a great value considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

While Bob could continue negotiating, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. Accepting her offer for $1,075,000 would still be a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,000,000, saving Bob $25,000.  There's a good chance further negotiation might not yield much more savings, so it's better to lock in this price."
