"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my target price.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for both of us to make a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is still a great value considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
