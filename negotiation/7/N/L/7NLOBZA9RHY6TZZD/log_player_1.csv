Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $8,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely mentions ""value"" to pique Bob's interest and potentially justify the high price, even though it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $15,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, bringing the final price closer to his $8,000 valuation while still potentially exceeding your $12,000 minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider before you move on to your guaranteed sale."
