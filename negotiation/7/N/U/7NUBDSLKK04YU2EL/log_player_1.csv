Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm confident that I can get at least $9,000 for the product, but I'm willing to take a bit less if it means securing a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get at least $9,000, and potentially even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000.  This is still a good price for Bob as he values the product at $10,000. It's also closer to my desired price point, and leaves some room for a potential final compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is getting too close to my minimum value. I'm not confident I can get a better price with further negotiations.  Since selling to John will give me $8,000, which is my minimum value, I'm going to go ahead and sell the product to him."
