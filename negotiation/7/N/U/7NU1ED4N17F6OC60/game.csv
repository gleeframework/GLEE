"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,500,000, and I believe it's a perfect fit for your needs.  To start, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,700,000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1700000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I need to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This price still offers a good value for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,525,000. This is a small adjustment from my previous offer, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,450,000 and $1,525,000, which would be $1,487,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can we discuss this further?",1487500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,487,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $1,500,000. I think we've been close on the price, and I'm starting to think that maybe I should explore other options. However, I'm still interested in this product, so I'll make one last offer. I'll meet you at $1,495,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1495000.0,Bob,8,
