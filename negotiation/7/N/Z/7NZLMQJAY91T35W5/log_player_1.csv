Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer allows for a potential profit of $20 while leaving room for negotiation. It's a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves some wiggle room for Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still higher than my minimum price of $80, and it's likely that we won't be able to get a better offer from him. Accepting his offer maximizes my profit while avoiding potential delays and the risk of a counteroffer from Bob that could be less favorable."
