Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This protects your profit margin.
* **It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation:**  It leaves room for both of you to compromise. 

If Bob rejects the offer, you can then assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer yourself. You also have the option of selling to John for $15,000 at any point if you feel the negotiation isn't going in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 and also lower than my initial offer of $13,500.  While I'm interested in selling the product to Bob, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. 

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will keep the negotiation going and hopefully lead to a more favorable outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. However, $11,000 is significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $12,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product and your budget."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting my interests. It's a lower price than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's. 
* **Reasoning:** I've explained my reasoning, highlighting the value of the product and the need for a price that's fair for both of us. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone throughout the negotiation can help keep Bob engaged and willing to find common ground.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and hopefully leads to a mutually acceptable agreement. I'm still open to considering Bob's potential counteroffers, but I'm determined to secure a price that meets my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $12,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,800? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I appreciate Bob's persistence and willingness to negotiate, his offer of $11,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss, especially since I have another buyer willing to pay my full asking price. 

I'll reject his offer and make a final counteroffer.  If he doesn't accept it, I'll move forward with selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I've tried to be flexible with my pricing. However, $11,800 is simply too low for me to accept. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who is willing to pay my asking price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer clearly indicates that this is my final offer. I'm not willing to negotiate further, and Bob needs to decide if he's willing to accept or not.
* **Clear Deadline:** I've set a clear deadline. This creates a sense of urgency and motivates Bob to make a decision.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and how the offer is a fair compromise.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm reminding Bob that I have other options, which reinforces my position and adds to the pressure. 

This counteroffer aims to push Bob to make a decision. If he doesn't accept, I'm prepared to move on to John."
