"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It's best to reject and see if Alice will negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $20,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $12000. This is a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll really appreciate it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth rejecting and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer at this price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll counteroffer at $10000. This is a fair price that should meet both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he's still determined to get the product for his maximum price of $8,000.  Rejecting and continuing negotiations is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're not willing to go lower than $10,000, but I'm really pushing my budget with that price.  I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $8,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the lowest I can go. I'll make one more compromise: I'll meet you at $9500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but $9,500 is still outside of Bob's budget. Since there are only a few rounds left, it's best to cut his losses and buy from John for $8,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
