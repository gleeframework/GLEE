"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm only able to offer $8500 at this time. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good middle ground. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm comfortable offering $9500.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $10500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $9800. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement this round.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a final agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work with me.  $10200 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm going to go one last time with an offer of $10000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.  I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,8,
