Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,999. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, she should aim for a price slightly lower than that to entice Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it at $11,999 leaves room for negotiation but ensures Alice gets a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  Framing the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity"" creates a sense of urgency and value. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring a sale above Alice's minimum acceptable price."
