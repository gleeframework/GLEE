Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get as much as possible.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to increase his interest.  If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway while still staying above my minimum price. I'm hoping he'll accept this counteroffer, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,000. This is the highest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a great opportunity! Bob is offering my minimum price, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer. I'm accepting his offer and closing the deal!"
