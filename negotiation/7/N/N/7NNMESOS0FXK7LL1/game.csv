"I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to come to an agreement. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $170. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $165.
