"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $1000000 and $1200000. How about $1100000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $900000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price between $1000000 and $1200000. How about $1050000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a bit of a concession. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $1050000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's make a deal!",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $950000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $1025000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
