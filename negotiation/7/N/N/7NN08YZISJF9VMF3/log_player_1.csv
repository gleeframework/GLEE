{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's estimated value of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me.  It also signals my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below my initial offer of $1,200,000.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. Considering the product's value and our initial discussions, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
