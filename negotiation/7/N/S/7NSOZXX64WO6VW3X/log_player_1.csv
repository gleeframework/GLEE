{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, but still allows some room for negotiation. It also shows I am willing to compromise, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. If he rejects, I can always go back to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I believe I can get closer to that by counteroffering and continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I understand you have a budget to stick to. While $12,000 is tempting, it's unfortunately below what I can accept for this product.  I'm willing to compromise further, though. How about $13,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,800 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and it stays within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my minimum price of $15,000, Bob's offer of $12,800 is now very close to my minimum. It's a good deal for me considering the risk of rejecting him and potentially having to sell to John at the same price.  I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
