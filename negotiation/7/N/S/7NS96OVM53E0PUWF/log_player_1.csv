Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel that we can find a mutually beneficial price. I would like to propose $950,000 for the product.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer, indicating he's willing to move closer to our desired price. 
* We still have several rounds left to negotiate, and we're confident we can push him higher.
* Accepting $950,000 now would leave a potential $50,000 on the table compared to our minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  Let's close this gap. I'm willing to accept $980,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  By stating ""final offer"", we create a sense of urgency and signal that we're firm on this price.
*  $980,000 is a strong position: it's a significant gain from Bob's last offer while still leaving us with a comfortable profit margin.
* This strategy aims to either close the deal now or prompt Bob to reveal his true willingness to pay in the next round."
