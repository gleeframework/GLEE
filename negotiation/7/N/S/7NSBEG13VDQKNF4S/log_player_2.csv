"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price.** You're willing to pay $150, but she's asking for $120. 
* **You have room for negotiation.**  It's better to try and get a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** You want to get as close to Alice's minimum price ($100) as possible without going over your limit.
* **Midpoint Offer:**  $105 is a reasonable starting point, showing you're serious about buying but also pushing for a lower price. 
* **Room for Compromise:** There's room for Alice to counter if needed, but you've already made a significant move towards her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price range. 
* **More negotiation is possible.** You've already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice has shown flexibility by lowering her price. There's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price with further negotiation. 
* **John's price is still the safety net.**  You can always choose to buy from John if you feel the negotiation isn't progressing favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from $105 to $110, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway.
* **Strategic Move:**  $110 is still within my budget, and is only a small increase from my previous offer. This gives Alice an incentive to accept to avoid further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By not offering my maximum price ($150), I retain leverage to potentially get a lower price if Alice counteroffers again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's come down from $125, it's still above your desired price range. 
* **Time for a strong counter-offer.** You've shown flexibility, but it's time to push for a more significant concession from Alice.
* **John's offer is still a backup.** You can always go to John, but you want to exhaust the negotiation with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump:**  This counteroffer is a larger increase than the previous one, showing Alice that you're serious about reaching a deal but are nearing your limit.
* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** $115 is halfway between your previous offer of $110 and Alice's current offer of $130. This is a good compromise point.
* **Pressure:**  With only 4 rounds left, this offer puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While she's coming down in price, she's still not within your desired range.
* **Time is running out.**  With only three rounds remaining, you need to push for a significant concession.
* **John's offer is still a backup.** You're close to your limit, but you want to see if you can get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is a significant jump from your previous offer, showing Alice that you're nearing your limit.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $120 is halfway between your previous offer of $115 and Alice's current offer of $135. 
* **High Stakes:** With only two rounds remaining, this offer puts substantial pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal entirely.
* **John's Offer Looms:** You're getting closer to your limit and will likely buy from John in the next round if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While she's continuing to come down, it's still above your desired price range.
* **One round left.** With only one round remaining, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price.
* **John's offer is your best option.**  It's within your budget, and you're guaranteed to get the product without further negotiation. 

You've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of not getting the product at all.  It's time to secure the purchase and move on."
