"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $95 is a bit too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 seems a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying well below my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try a counteroffer a little closer to her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm still aiming for a good deal."
