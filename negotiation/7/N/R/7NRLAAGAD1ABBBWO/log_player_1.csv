Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,280,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, $1,280,000 is still too low for me. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,280,000. I'm willing to go down to $1,320,000. This is my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1320000}

Bob is getting closer, but we're running out of rounds. It's getting risky to continue negotiating with Bob because I might not reach my minimum goal.  I'm going to sell to John and secure the $1,500,000."
