"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Would you consider $140?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would save us both some time.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $160. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. How about $150? This is a great price for both of us, and it would allow me to finalize the purchase without needing to go elsewhere.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $155. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to meet you in the middle. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
