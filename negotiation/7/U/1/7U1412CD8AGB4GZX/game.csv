"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,500?  I'm confident this is still a great value for you, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $10,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $10,750?  I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I believe this offer is fair and reasonable.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 as a final offer. This is a very fair price for the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,7,
