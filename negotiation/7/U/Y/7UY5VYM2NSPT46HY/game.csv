"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Given the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it leaves room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
