"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8000, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  This is my maximum budget for this product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I hope you'll consider it.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $9000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",14000.0,Alice,5,
