"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8000, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, it's not a reasonable starting point.  Bob should reject the offer and proceed with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  This is my maximum budget for this product."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's a step in the right direction, Bob should reject this offer and continue to negotiate.  He should try to get closer to his target price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $9000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's latest offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While Alice is willing to negotiate further, it's clear that she won't come down to a price that Bob is comfortable with. It's time for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $8,000, as this ensures he gets the product within his budget."
