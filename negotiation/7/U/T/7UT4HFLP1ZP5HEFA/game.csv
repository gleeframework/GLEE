,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $128? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $135, but I really want to stay within my budget.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try $132.  It's a small step up from your offer, but it's a price I can realistically work with.  I'm confident you won't regret this purchase - the product is truly fantastic!",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $129, but that's as high as I can stretch. Can you meet me at that price?",129.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close to the end of our negotiation.  I'm willing to meet you at $131.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen. What do you say?",131.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to giving up, but I really want to get this product. Can you meet me at $128? That's the lowest I can go and still feel good about the purchase.",128.0,Bob,8,
