"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $137.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $125 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price again, but $125 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
