Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I can potentially get more from Bob or John. It's worth exploring other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $137.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $115 is closer to my desired price, I can potentially get a better offer from either Bob or John.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $125 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price again, but $125 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer. Although it's still slightly below my ideal price of $150, it's getting closer to my minimum of $150. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming and might not yield a significantly better price.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and a reasonable profit."
