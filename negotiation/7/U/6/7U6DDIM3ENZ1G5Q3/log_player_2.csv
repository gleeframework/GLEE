"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way too high, and you can get the product for cheaper from John. It's a good idea to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your limit.  You're better off continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $137.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $125 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still a bit above your limit. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice for a lower price before you consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price again, but $125 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
