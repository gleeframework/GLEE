Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Motivational Message:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:** A positive tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation unfolds. I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John if the deal with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my leverage in the negotiation.  I can use this to try and get a higher price in the next round.
* **Not Ready to Settle:** I'm not ready to settle for a price that is lower than what the product is worth to me. 

**Next Steps:**

I will now prepare a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I need to be careful not to go too low, but also need to consider the time remaining in the negotiation and the possibility of selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800,000? That's still a great price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's work this out."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price that's in the middle between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.

* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully assess the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John.  I might need to consider offering a further concession, but I'll be careful not to go too low."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is mounting. However, I'm still holding out for a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer Remains:**  I'm still comfortable with selling to John if necessary, and that's a guarantee of my minimum price. 

**Next Steps:**
