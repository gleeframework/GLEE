"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($1,100,000) is above your maximum price point ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.**
* **You have leverage because you know John will sell you the product for $1,200,000.**  

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price. If she's motivated to sell, she might be willing to come down closer to her own valuation of $800,000."
