"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant investment for me. I hope you consider this counteroffer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a substantial amount and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to pay $900,000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to pay $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,500,000.",975000.0,Alice,7,
