Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer of $87.50 is a good deal for you. It's lower than John's price and still within your budget. You'll accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
