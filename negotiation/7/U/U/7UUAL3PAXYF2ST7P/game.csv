"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This reflects my commitment to seeing this product in the hands of someone who truly understands its worth.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you believe in the value of the product, and I respect that. However, $1,120,000 is still out of my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a significant investment for me, and it's the highest I can realistically offer.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price given the product's unique nature.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  we're getting closer! While I value this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to pay $1,085,000. It's a significant investment on my end, and I believe this price represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1085000.0,Bob,6,
