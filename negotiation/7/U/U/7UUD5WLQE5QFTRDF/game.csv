"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above what I can realistically pay right now. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to pay $1,025,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and it's the best I can offer at this time.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is already a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's the best we can do. I'm willing to accept this price and finalize the deal with you.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
