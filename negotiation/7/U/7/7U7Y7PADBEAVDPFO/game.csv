"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $11500. I'm looking to spend closer to $10500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $11000?  I'm confident this is still a good deal for you, given the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  How about $10750?  That's a fair price for us both and will get this deal done.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10900 as a final compromise.  I truly believe this is a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this and make it happen.",10900.0,Alice,5,
