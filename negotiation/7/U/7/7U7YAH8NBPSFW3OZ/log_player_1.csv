Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:**  This is a starting point that's above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **""Open to negotiation"":** This signals flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I'm trying to maximize my potential profit while also giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. This increases the chances of a successful negotiation and avoids immediately resorting to selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to accept and avoid the hassle of further negotiation, I'm still holding out for a better price. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. While I can sell to John for $150, there's a chance I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $120 is lower than my initial price, but it's unfortunately too far below what I can accept.  Would you be willing to go up to $140? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $140:** This is a compromise that's closer to my minimum price point, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **""Fair compromise"":**  Framing the offer as a compromise makes it seem more appealing to Bob and encourages him to accept. 

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, I'm increasing the likelihood of reaching a deal without immediately resorting to selling to John. The message also focuses on fairness, aiming to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum price of $150, but it's getting closer.  Given that the negotiation has already gone on for a few rounds, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further back-and-forth and secure a sale. 

**Strategy:**

While $130 isn't ideal, it's a decent compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $150, and I'm not confident that further negotiation will result in a significantly higher price.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the sale and move on."
