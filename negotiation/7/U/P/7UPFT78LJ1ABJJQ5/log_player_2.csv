"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay almost double that to Alice."
