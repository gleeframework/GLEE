"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to the right person. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from its true potential value, and I'm confident you'll see the immense potential it holds.  Please let me know if you're interested.  If not, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe you would be the perfect fit.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
