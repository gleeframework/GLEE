Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high.  
* **Testing the Waters:** A starting price of $2,000,000 gauges Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can strategically lower the price, still aiming for a final price well above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" can psychologically justify the high asking price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knows you have a guaranteed buyer at a lower price, this strategy might backfire."
