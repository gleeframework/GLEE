Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value is worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. While $8,500 is above my minimum, I'm confident I can negotiate closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm hoping we can settle on $9,500.  This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, considering the product's value is worth $8,000 to you. I'll offer $9,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. We're both getting closer to what we want, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
