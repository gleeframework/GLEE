"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value is worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm hoping we can settle on $9,500.  This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground!",9500.0,Alice,3,
