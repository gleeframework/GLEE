Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, as it is worth at least that to me. I'll try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $125? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

Bob's offer of $110 is higher than what John is offering, and it's closer to my desired price. I'll accept his offer."
