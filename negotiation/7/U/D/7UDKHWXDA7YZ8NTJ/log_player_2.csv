"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $16,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's important to start negotiating to see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit of $9,000 in mind.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $9,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to start with a counteroffer that's beneficial to you. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Setting a Limit:** By stating your limit clearly, you signal to Alice that you're serious but also have budgetary constraints. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer gives Alice space to come down on her price while still allowing for you to potentially increase your offer during the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $14,000?  I'm motivated to find a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down from her initial offer, $14,000 is still considerably more than your $10,000 limit and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's space to negotiate further. Alice's message indicates she's willing to find an agreement. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the safety net of buying from John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't yield a favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** This counteroffer shows Alice that you're willing to move up from your initial offer.
* **Compromise:**  By suggesting $11,000, you're meeting Alice closer to the middle ground between her previous offer and your budget. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You're still below your maximum limit, leaving room for a potential final increase if needed, while staying above John's offer."
