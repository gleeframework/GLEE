{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd ideally accept. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately undervalue the product.
* **Knowing Bob's Value:** I'm aware that the product is worth $80 to Bob. This means he has a potential profit margin if he buys it at a lower price.
* **Potential Counteroffer:** This initial offer is likely to prompt a counteroffer from Bob, allowing for further negotiation.
* **The John Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer, John, willing to pay $150. This sets a floor for my negotiations and prevents me from accepting offers below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $100 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest in the product. This gives me an opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a Safety Net:**  I'm not desperate for a sale. Having John as a backup buyer at $150 provides me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $100 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** My counteroffer is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial asking price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Balancing the Scales:**  $130 is still above my minimum value of $150 but leaves room for Bob to potentially counteroffer again.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, highlighting that even at $130, he's getting a good deal.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  I'm not closing the door completely, leaving space for further negotiations if Bob is still unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and am willing to go up to $110 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  Bob's offer of $110 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would mean losing money.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  While Bob has raised his offer, there's limited room for further negotiation to reach a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John is a Better Option:**  Selling to John at $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might not yield a better result.

**It's more beneficial to take the guaranteed profit from John rather than continue negotiating with Bob, who is still significantly below my acceptable price point.**"
