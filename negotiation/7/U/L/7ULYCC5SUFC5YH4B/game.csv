"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
