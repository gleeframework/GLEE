Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what John is offering, but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob.  This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A price of $1,150,000 is a good middle ground that gives Bob a decent discount while still leaving a significant profit for you.
* **Encourage negotiation:** By offering a price that isn't the absolute highest, you invite Bob to counter and engage in a back-and-forth. 
* **Preserve the John option:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives you the leverage to walk away from negotiations if Bob doesn't meet your price. 

Remember, the key is to be flexible but firm in your negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still far below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to close the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000. This is a compromise,  showing I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a price closer to my target.  This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  It demonstrates I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintains a healthy profit margin:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly more than what John is offering, ensuring I'm getting a good deal. 
* **Keeps the pressure on Bob:**  It puts the ball back in Bob's court, allowing me to see if he's serious about buying the product.

Let's see how Bob reacts to this revised offer!"
