Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $2,000,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have room to start high.  Offering it at $2,000,000 aims to maximize your potential profit.
* **Time Limit:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the high price without trying to negotiate down significantly.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept. 

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, overshooting the price drastically could lead Bob to dismiss the offer outright. This approach balances risk and potential reward."
