Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. To that end, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you have strong leverage. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potential for a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value and hints at your awareness of its worth to Bob. This can make a higher price more palatable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message keeps the conversation open, suggesting willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving room for a deal that benefits both parties."
