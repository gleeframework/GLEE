"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. I understand its value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at a price that's fair for both of us.  Let's start with $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $800,000 is unfortunately far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000. This still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
