Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Signaling Value:** Offering it at $1,300,000 (significantly higher than his perceived value) reinforces the idea that the product is highly valuable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By stating you're ""open to discussing"", you signal flexibility and invite Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

This is just an opening offer. How I proceed will depend heavily on Bob's response and counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good chunk of money, it's still significantly less than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and my initial asking price. Bob stating he won't go above $900,000 feels like an attempt to anchor the negotiation. I need to push back and see if there's room for him to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you see the value in the product, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth to me.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,150,000?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing Flexibility:** By reducing the price, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The new price is still comfortably above my $1,000,000 minimum, leaving me room to maneuver. 
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** This counteroffer will help me gauge if Bob is truly fixed at $900,000 or if there's potential for him to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is above my $1,000,000 minimum, meaning I'll make a profit.
* **Strong Counter:** He met me halfway again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I *might* be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob with another round, there's also the risk he gets frustrated and walks away. Accepting this offer guarantees a good outcome."
