"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you see the value in the product, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth to me.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
