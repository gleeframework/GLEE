"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could potentially do $9,500, but that's really my limit.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
