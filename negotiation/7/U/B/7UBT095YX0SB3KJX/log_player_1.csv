Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $175 is a reasonable markup from my minimum and might be appealing to Bob if he values the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I'm starting at $175, this initial offer opens the door for potential negotiation with Bob if he's interested but wants a slightly lower price."
