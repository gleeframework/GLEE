Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for potential compromise.  I want to maximize my profit, but also recognize that starting too high could immediately result in a rejection and unnecessary delays."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $75 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $85? That's a good compromise, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $82 is still below my ideal price of $90, it's getting closer.  At this point, it's a risk to keep rejecting Bob's offers. There's a chance he might walk away completely, and I'd have to settle with John at $100.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and a profit, though a smaller one than I initially hoped for."
